Timeline_of_Solar_System_exploration
 Charted timeline of Solar System exploration, as of December 2014 This is a timeline of Solar System exploration ordered by date of spacecraft launch. It includes: All spacecraft that have left Earth orbit for the purposes of Solar System exploration (or were launched with that intention but failed), including lunar probes . A small number of pioneering or notable Earth-orbiting craft. It does not include: The great majority of Earth-orbiting satellites. Space probes leaving Earth orbit that are not concerned with Solar System exploration (such as space telescopes targeted at distant galaxies, cosmic background radiation observatories, and so on). Probes that failed at launch. The dates listed are launch dates, but the achievements noted may have occurred some time later—in some cases, a considerable time later (for example, Voyager 2 , launched 20 August 1977, did not reach Neptune until 1989). Missions in italics are unfinished, i.e. have not yet been designated as successes or failures. Some unitalicised missions are nevertheless still operational, some in mission extension phases. 1950s Sputnik 1 – First Earth orbiter 1957 Sputnik 1 – 4 October 1957 – First Earth orbiter Sputnik 2 – 3 November 1957 – Earth orbiter, first animal in orbit , a dog named Laika 1958 Explorer 1 – 1 February 1958 – Earth orbiter; first American orbiter, discovered Van Allen radiation belts Vanguard 1 – 17 March 1958 – Earth orbiter; oldest spacecraft still in Earth orbit 1959 Luna 1 – 2 January 1959 – First lunar flyby (attempted lunar impact?)
