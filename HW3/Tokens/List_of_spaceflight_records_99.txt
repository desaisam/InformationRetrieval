List_of_spaceflight_records
 The first space rendezvous was accomplished by Gemini 6A and Gemini 7 in 1965 This is a list of spaceflight records . Most of these records relate to human spaceflights , but some unmanned and animal records are listed as well. First independent suborbital and orbital human spaceflight by country Human spaceflight firsts Most spaceflights 7 spaceflights Jerry L. Ross – USA Franklin Chang Díaz – Costa Rica/USA* 6 spaceflights John W. Young – USA (While Young has made six spaceflights, he was launched into orbit seven times if his Moon ascent on Apollo 16 is counted.) Story Musgrave – USA Curtis Brown – USA James Wetherbee – USA Michael Foale – United Kingdom/USA dual citizen Sergei Krikalev – Russia Yuri Malenchenko – Russia Duration records Total human spaceflight time by country Most time in space Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka , who has spent 878 days in space over five missions, became the record holder for the most time spent in space when he surpassed, on 28 June 2015, the record of cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev , who spent 803 days, 9 hours and 39 minutes (about 2.2 years) in space over the span of six spaceflights on Soyuz , the Space Shuttle , Mir , and the International Space Station . Yuri Malenchenko is currently in second place, having spent 828 days in space on six spaceflights. The following is a list of the 50 space travelers with the most total time in space, as of 20 December 2018. Travelers currently in space are ranked by total time in space of their completed missions only. Color key: Currently in space Active Retired Deceased Ten longest human spaceflights Longest single flight by a woman NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman when she surpassed Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti 's 199 days, 16 hours during Expedition 52 in 2017. She returned to Earth in September 2017, having spent 289 days, 5 hours and 1 minute in space. In third place is American astronaut Sunita Williams with 195 days on the ISS, where she was a member of Expedition 14 / Expedition 15 (2006–2007). Longest continuous occupation of space An international partnership consisting of Russia, the United States, Canada, Japan and the member states of the European Space Agency have jointly maintained a continuous human presence in space since 31 October 2000, when Soyuz TM-31 was launched. Two days later it docked with the International Space Station . Since then space has been continuously occupied for 18 years, 107 days. Longest continuous occupation of a spacecraft The International Space Station has been continuously occupied since 2 November 2000 (18 years, 105 days). It broke the record of 9 years and 358 days of the Soviet/Russian Space Station Mir on 23 October 2010. Longest solo flight Valery Bykovsky flew solo for 4 days, 23 hours in Vostok 5 from 14 to 19 June 1963. The flight set a space endurance record which was broken in 1965 by the (non-solo) Gemini 5 flight. The Apollo program included long solo spaceflight, and during the Apollo 16 mission, T. K. Mattingly orbited solo around the Moon for more than 3 days and 9 hours . Longest time on the lunar surface Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt of the Apollo 17 mission stayed for 74 hours 59 minutes and 40 seconds (over 3 days) on the lunar surface after they landed on 11 December 1972. They performed three EVAs (extra-vehicular activity) totaling 22 hours 3 minutes, 57 seconds (as commanders were always the first one out of the LM and the last to get back in, Cernan's EVA time was slightly longer). Longest time in lunar orbit Ronald Evans of Apollo 17 mission stayed in lunar orbit for 6 days and 4 hours (148 hours); however, for the solo portion of that flight around the Moon, T. K. Mattingly on Apollo 16 spent 1 hour 38 minutes longer than Evans' solo duration. Speed and altitude records Farthest humans from Earth The Apollo 13 crew ( Jim Lovell , Fred Haise , and Jack Swigert ), while passing over the far side of the Moon at an altitude of 254 km (158 mi) from the lunar surface, were 400,171 km (248,655 mi) from Earth. This record-breaking distance was reached at 0:21 UTC on 15 April 1970. Highest altitude for manned non-lunar mission Gemini 11 crew Charles Conrad, Jr. and Richard F. Gordon, Jr. fired their Agena Target Vehicle rocket engine on 14 September 1966, at 40 hours 30 minutes after liftoff and achieved a record apogee altitude of 739.2 nautical miles (1,369.0 km). Fastest The Apollo 10 crew ( Thomas Stafford , John W. Young and Eugene Cernan ) achieved the highest speed relative to Earth ever attained by humans: 39,897 kilometers per hour (11.082 kilometers per second or 24,791 miles per hour, approximately 32 times the speed of sound and 0.0037 percent of the speed of light ). The record was set 26 May 1969. Age records John Glenn, 14 April 1998 Earliest-born to reach space (suborbital flight) Joe Walker (born 20 February 1921), on X-15 Flight 90 on 19 July 1963. Earliest-born to reach space (orbital flight) Man – Georgy Beregovoy (born 15 April 1921), on Soyuz 3 on 26 October 1968. Woman – Valentina Tereshkova (born 6 March 1937), on Vostok 6 on 16–19 June 1963. Youngest (age during spaceflight) Man – Gherman Titov (aged 25 years), on Vostok 2 on 6 August 1961. Woman – Valentina Tereshkova (aged 26 years), on Vostok 6 on 16–19 June 1963. Oldest (age during spaceflight) Man – John Glenn (aged 77), on STS-95 on 29 October 1998. Woman – Peggy Whitson (aged 56), on Soyuz MS-03 on 17 November 2016. She turned 57 on 9 February 2017, while still in space. Spacewalk records Most spacewalks Man – Anatoly Solovyev , 16 spacewalks for a total time of 82 hours, 21 minutes (which is also the duration record). Woman – Peggy Whitson , 10 spacewalks for a total time of 60 hours, 21 minutes. Most spacewalks during a single mission 7: Anatoly Solovyev , during the 24th Expedition on the Soviet/Russian space station Mir , in 1997–98. (Two were internal "spacewalks" inside a depressurized module.) 6: Leonid Kizim and Vladimir Solovyov , the third crew on the Soviet space station Salyut 7 . Animal records First living organisms in space The first living organisms of any kind to enter space were fruit flies launched by the United States in 1947 aboard a V-2 rocket to an altitude of 68 miles (109 km). They were also the first animals to safely return from space. First animal in orbit Laika was a Soviet female canine launched on 3 November 1957 on Sputnik 2 . The technology to de-orbit had not yet been developed, so there was no expectation for survival. She died several hours into flight. Belka and Strelka became the first canines to safely return to Earth from orbit on 19 August 1960. Longest canine single flight Soviet space dogs Veterok ( Ветерок , "Light Wind") and Ugolyok ( Уголёк , "Ember") were launched on 22 February 1966 on board Cosmos 110 and spent 22 days in orbit before landing on 16 March. First animals beyond low-Earth orbit An assortment of animals including a pair of Russian tortoises , as well as wine flies and mealworms launched with a number of other biological specimens including seeds and bacteria on a circumlunar mission aboard the Soviet Zond 5 spacecraft on 15 September 1968. It was launched by a Proton-K rocket. The capsule came within 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) of the Moon and later successfully returned to Earth, the first spacecraft in history to return safely to Earth from the Moon.
