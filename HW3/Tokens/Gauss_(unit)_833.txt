Gauss_(unit)
 The gauss , abbreviated as G or Gs, is the cgs unit of measurement of magnetic flux density (or " magnetic induction ") ( B ). It is named after German mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss . One gauss is defined as one maxwell per square centimeter . The cgs system has been superseded by the International System of Units (SI), which uses the tesla (symbol T) as the unit of magnetic flux density. One gauss equals 1 × 10 tesla (100 μT), so 1 tesla = 10,000 gauss. Unit name and convention As with all units whose names are derived from a person's name, the first letter of its symbol is uppercase ("G"), but when the unit is spelled out, it should be written in lowercase ("gauss"), unless it begins a sentence. Unit conversions 1 G = M x c m 2 = c m − 1 / 2 ⋅ g 1 / 2 ⋅ s − 1 = 10 − 4 T = 10 − 4 k g A ⋅ s 2 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}1\,{\rm {G}}&={\frac {\rm {Mx}}{{\rm {cm}}^{2}}}={\rm {cm}}^{-1/2}{\cdot }{\rm {g}}^{1/2}{\cdot }{\rm {s}}^{-1}\\&=10^{-4}\,{\rm {T}}=10^{-4}{\frac {\rm {kg}}{{\rm {A}}{\cdot }{\rm {s^{2}}}}}\end{aligned}}} According to the system of Gaussian units (cgs), the gauss is the unit of magnetic flux density B and the equivalent of Mx /cm , while the oersted is the unit of magnetizing field H . One tesla (T) is equal to 10 gauss, and one ampere (A) per meter is equal to 4π x 10 oersted. The units for magnetic flux Φ, which is the integral of magnetic field over an area , are the weber (Wb) in the SI and the maxwell (Mx) in the cgs system. The conversion factor is 10 , since flux is the integral of field over an area, area having the units of the square of distance, thus 10 (magnetic field conversion factor) times the square of 10 (linear distance conversion factor, i.e. , centimetres per meter). 10 =10 X(10 ) . Typical values 10 –10 gauss – the magnetic field of the human brain 10 –10 gauss – the magnetic field of Galactic molecular clouds 0.25–0.60 gauss – the Earth's magnetic field at its surface 25 gauss – the Earth's magnetic field in its core 50 gauss – a typical refrigerator magnet 100 gauss – an iron magnet 1500 gauss - within a sun spot 10000 to 13000 gauss – remanence of a neodymium-iron-boron (NIB) magnet 16000 to 22000 gauss - saturation of high permeability iron alloys used in transformers 3000–70,000 gauss – a medical magnetic resonance imaging machine 10 –10 gauss – the surface of a neutron star 4×10 gauss – the quantum electrodynamic threshold 10 gauss – the magnetic field of some newly created magnetars 10 gauss – the upper limit to neutron star magnetism See also Centimetre–gram–second system of units Gaussian units Carl Friedrich Gauss Magnetic field
