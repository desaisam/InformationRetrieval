Chronology_of_European_exploration_of_Asia
 The Fra Mauro map , completed around 1459, is a map of the then-known world. Following the standard practice at that time, south is at the top. The map was said by Giovanni Battista Ramusio to have been partially based on the one brought from Cathay by Marco Polo . This is a chronology of the early European exploration of Asia .

(Illustration from 1558). The Cantino planisphere (or Cantino World Map) of 1502 is the earliest surviving map showing Portuguese Discoveries in the east and west. 1497–1499: The Portuguese Vasco da Gama , accompanied by Nicolau Coelho and Bartolomeu Dias , is the first European to reach India by an all-sea route from Europe. 1500–1501: After discovering Brazil, Pedro Álvares Cabral , with the half of an original fleet of 13 ships and 1,500 men, accomplished the second Portuguese trip to India .

Luís Pires returned to Portugal just after reaching Cape Verde. Vasco de Ataíde, Bartolomeu Dias, Simão de Pina and Aires Gomes' ships were lost near the Cape of Good Hope.

In 1511 Ayutthaya Kingdom (Thailand) received a diplomatic mission from the Portuguese. These were probably the first Europeans to visit the country. Five years after that initial contact, Ayutthaya and Portugal concluded a treaty granting the Portuguese permission to trade in the kingdom. 1512: Malay pilots guided the Portuguese via Java, the Lesser Sundas and Ambon to Banda, arriving in early 1512.
