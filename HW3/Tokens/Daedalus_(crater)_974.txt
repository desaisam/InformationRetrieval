Daedalus_(crater)
 Lunar Orbiter 2 image Closeup of the interior from Apollo 11 Daedalus is a prominent crater located near the center of the far side of the Moon . The inner wall is terraced , and there is a cluster of central peaks on the relatively flat floor. Because of its location (shielded from radio emissions from the Earth ), it has been proposed as the site of a future giant radio telescope , which would be scooped out of the crater itself, much like the Arecibo radio telescope , but on a vastly larger scale. The crater is named after Daedalus of Greek myth . It is pictured in famous photographs taken by the Apollo 11 astronauts. In contemporary sources it was called "Crater 308" (this was a temporary IAU designation that preceded the establishment of far-side lunar nomenclature). Nearby craters of note include Icarus to the east and Racah to the south. Less than a crater diameter to the north-northeast is Lipskiy . Satellite craters By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Daedalus.
