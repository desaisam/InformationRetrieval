Unmanned_spacecraft
 PAGEOS test Unmanned or uncrewed spacecraft are spacecraft without people on board, used for unmanned spaceflight . Uncrewed spacecraft may have varying levels of autonomy from human input; they may be remote controlled , remote guided or even autonomous , meaning they have a pre-programmed list of operations, which they will execute unless otherwise instructed. Many habitable spacecraft also have varying levels of robotic features. For example, the space stations Salyut 7 and Mir , and the ISS module Zarya were capable of remote guided station-keeping, and docking maneuvers with both resupply craft and new modules. The most common uncrewed spacecraft categories are robotic spacecraft , uncrewed resupply spacecraft , space probes and space observatories . Not every uncrewed spacecraft is a robotic spacecraft; for example, a reflector ball is a non-robotic uncrewed spacecraft. Examples For a more detailed list, see List of Solar System probes .
