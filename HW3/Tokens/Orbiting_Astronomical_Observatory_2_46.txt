Orbiting_Astronomical_Observatory_2
 The Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2 ( OAO-2 , nicknamed Stargazer ) was the first space telescope , launched on December 7, 1968. An Atlas-Centaur rocket launched it into a nearly circular 750-kilometre (470 mi) altitude Earth orbit. Data was collected in ultraviolet on many sources including comets, planets, and galaxies. It had two major instrument sets facing in opposite directions; the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) and the Wisconsin Experiment Package (WEP). One discovery was large halos of hydrogen gas around comets, and it also observed Nova Serpentis , which was a nova discovered in 1970. Celescope: Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, also called Celescope, had four 12 inch (30.5 cm) Schwarzschild telescopes that fed into Uvicons. Various filters, photocathodes , and electronics aided in collecting data in several ultraviolet light passbands . The experiment was completed in April 1970. By the time it finished about 10 percent of the sky was observed. The Uvicon was an ultra-violet light detector based on the Westinghouse Vidicon . Ultraviolet light was converted into electron s which were in-turn converted to a voltage as those electrons hit the detection area of the tube. There has been a Uvicon in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution since 1973. Wisconsin Experiment Package The Wisconsin Experiment Package had eleven different telescopes for ultraviolet observations. For example, there was a photoelectric photometer fed by a 16-inch (40.64 cm) telescope with a six-position filter wheel. WEP observed over 1200 targets in ultraviolet light before the mission ended in early 1973. Spacecraft bus The observatory was overall about 10 ft by 7 in the shape of an octahedron and it weighed 4400 pounds.
