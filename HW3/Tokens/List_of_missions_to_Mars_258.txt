 Missions Locations of selected Mars landers and rovers Interactive imagemap of the global topography of Mars , overlain with locations of Mars landers and rovers . Hover your mouse to see the names of over 25 prominent geographic features , and click to link to them. Coloring of the base map indicates relative elevations , based on data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor . Whites and browns indicate the highest elevations ( 7004120000000000000♠ +12 to +8 km ); followed by reds and pinks ( 7003300000000000000♠ +3 to +8 km ); yellow is 5000000000000000000♠ 0 km ; greens and blues are lower elevation (down to 2996200000000000000♠ −8 km ). Axes are latitude and longitude ; Poles are not shown.

There should be 8 derelict Mars orbiters barring unforeseen events if they have not decayed as of 2016. One example is Mariner 9 , which entered Mars orbit in 1971 and is expected to remain in orbit until approximately 2022, when the spacecraft is projected to enter the Martian atmosphere and either burn up or crash into the planet's surface. The Viking 1 orbiter is predicted not to decay until at least 2019. One orbiter that is confirmed to have undergone Mars atmospheric entry is Mars Climate Orbiter . (see also List of Mars orbiters ) Future missions In development Proposals Missions to the moons of Mars Phobos' Stickney Crater Deimos (lower left) and Phobos (lower right) compared with the asteroid 951 Gaspra Phobos by Mars Global Surveyor in 1998 Missions dedicated to explore the two moons of Mars , Phobos and Deimos . Many missions to Mars have also included dedicated observations of the Moons, while this section is about missions focused solely on them. There have been three unsuccessful dedicated missions and many proposals. Because of the proximity of the Mars moons to Mars, any mission to them may also be considered a mission to Mars from some perspectives. There have been at least three proposals in the United States Discovery Program , including PADME, PANDORA, and MERLIN. The ESA has also considered a sample return mission, one of the latest known as Martian Moon Sample Return or MMSR, and it may use heritage from an asteroid sample return mission. In Japan, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) is developing a sample return mission to Phobos, due to launch in 2024. This mission is called Martian Moons Exploration (MMX) and is proposed as a flagship Strategic Large Mission. MMX will build on the expertise the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) would gain through the Hayabusa2 and SLIM missions. As of January 2018, MMX is set for launch in September 2024. Three missions to land on Phobos have been launched; the Phobos program in the late 1980s saw the launch of Fobos 1 and Fobos 2 , while the Fobos-Grunt sample return mission was launched in 2011. None of these missions were successful: Fobos 1 failed en route to Mars, Fobos 2 failed shortly before landing, and Fobos-Grunt never left low Earth orbit . Missions sent to the Martian system have returned data on Phobos and Deimos and missions specifically dedicated to the moons are a subset of missions Mars that often include dedicated goals to acquire data about these moons. An example of this is the imaging campaigns by Mars Express of the Mars moons. Osiris-Rex 2 was a proposal to make OR a double mission, with the other one collecting samples from the two Mars moons. In 2012, it was stated that this mission would be the both quickest and least expensive way to get samples from the Moons. The 'Red Rocks Project', a part of Lockheed Martin's "Stepping stones to Mars" program, proposed to explore Mars robotically from Deimos. Undeveloped concepts 1970s Mars 4NM and Mars 5NM – projects intended by the Soviet Union for heavy Marsokhod (in 1973 according to initial plan of 1970) and Mars sample return (planned for 1975). The missions were to be launched on the failed N1 rocket. Mars 5M (Mars-79) – double-launching Soviet sample return mission planned to 1979 but cancelled due to complexity and technical problems Voyager-Mars – USA, 1970s – Two orbiters and two landers, launched by a single Saturn V rocket. 1990s Vesta – the multiaimed Soviet mission, developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991–1994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding, included the flyby of Mars with delivering the aerostat and small landers or penetrators followed by flybys of 1 Ceres or 4 Vesta and some other asteroids with impact of penetrator on the one of them. Mars Aerostat – Russian/French balloon part for cancelled Vesta mission and then for failed Mars 96 mission, originally planned for the 1992 launch window, postponed to 1994 and then to 1996 before being cancelled. Mars Together, combined U.S. and Russian mission study in the 1990s. To be launched by a Molinya with possible U.S. orbiter or lander. Mars Environmental Survey – set of 16 landers planned for 1999–2009 Mars-98 – Russian mission including an orbiter, lander, and rover, planned for 1998 launch opportunity as repeat of failured Mars 96 mission and cancelled due to lack of funding 2000s Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander – October 2001 – Mars lander (refurbished, became Phoenix lander) Kitty Hawk – Mars airplane micromission, proposed for December 17, 2003, the centennial of the Wright brothers' first flight. Its funding was eventually given to the 2003 Mars Network project. NetLander – 2007 or 2009 – Mars netlanders Beagle 3 – 2009 British lander mission meant to search for life, past or present. Mars Telecommunications Orbiter – September 2009 – Mars orbiter for telecommunications 2010s Sky-Sailor – 2014 – Plane developed by Switzerland to take detailed pictures of Mars surface Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher – 2018 rover concept, cancelled due to budget cuts in 2011. Sample cache goal later moved to Mars 2020 rover. Red Dragon – Derivative of a Dragon 2 capsule by SpaceX, designed to land by aerobraking and retropropulsion. Planned for 2018, then 2020. Cancelled in favor of the Starship system. Tumbleweed rover. See also Artificial objects on Mars Exploration of Mars Manned mission to Mars Mars Exploration Rover Mars flyby Mars landing Mars rover
