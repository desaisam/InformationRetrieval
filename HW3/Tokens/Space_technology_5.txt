Outline_of_space_technology
 Space technology is technology developed by space science or the aerospace industry for use in spaceflight , satellites , or space exploration . Space technology includes spacecraft, satellites, space stations, and support infrastructure, equipment, and procedures. Space is such a novel environment that attempting to work in it requires new tools and techniques. Many common everyday services such as weather forecasting , remote sensing , GPS systems, satellite television , and some long distance communications systems critically rely on space infrastructure. Of the sciences, astronomy and Earth science (via remote sensing ) benefit from space technology. New technologies originating with or accelerated by space-related endeavours are often subsequently exploited in other economic activities. Types of space technologies Satellite technology Satellite Types of satellites Communications satellite Direct-broadcast satellite Earth observation satellite Geosynchronous satellite Military satellite Reconnaissance satellite Navigation satellite Tracking and data relay satellite Weather satellite Specific satellites List of Earth observation satellites List of satellites in geosynchronous orbit List of satellites which have provided data on Earth's magnetosphere Satellite orbit Artificial satellites in retrograde orbit Satellite-based services Satellite navigation Satellite radio Satellite television Space exploration technology Aerobot (Planetary probe suspended in atmosphere) Lunar rover Mars rover Manned space mission Space flight technology Spaceflight Ablative heat shield Aerobraking Booster (rocketry) Gantry Reusable launch system â€”the Space Shuttle and X-37 are partially reusable spaceplanes ; SpaceX is currently developing a set of reusable technologies to support booster reuse and second-stage reuse.
