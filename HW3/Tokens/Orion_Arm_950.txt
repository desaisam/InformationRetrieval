Orion_Arm
 Observed structure of the Milky Way 's spiral arms The Orion Arm is a minor spiral arm of the Milky Way some 3,500 light-years (1,100 parsecs ) across and approximately 10,000 light-years (3,100 parsecs) in length, containing the Solar System , including the Earth . It is also referred to by its full name, the Orion–Cygnus Arm , as well as Local Arm , Orion Bridge , and formerly, the Local Spur and Orion Spur . Orion Arm from Sinai, Egypt The arm is named for the Orion constellation , which is one of the most prominent constellations of Northern Hemisphere winter (Southern Hemisphere summer). Some of the brightest stars and most famous celestial objects of the constellation (e.g. Betelgeuse , Rigel , the three stars of Orion's Belt , the Orion Nebula ) are within it as shown on the interactive map below . The arm is between the Carina–Sagittarius Arm (the local portions of which are toward the Galactic Center ) and the Perseus Arm (the local portion of which is the main outer-most arm and one of two major arms of the galaxy). Long thought to be a minor structure, namely a "spur" between the two arms mentioned, evidence was presented in mid 2013 that our arm might be a branch of the Perseus Arm, or possibly an independent arm segment. Within the arm, the Solar System is close to its inner rim, in a relative cavity in the arm's Interstellar Medium known as the Local Bubble , about halfway along the arm's length, approximately 8,000 parsecs (26,000 light-years) from the Galactic Center.
