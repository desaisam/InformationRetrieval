List_of_human_spaceflights
 Apollo 7 heads into orbit with its crew of three, 1968 This is a list of all human spaceflights throughout history. Beginning in 1961 with the flight of Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1 , human spaceflight occurs when a human crew flies a spacecraft into outer space . Human spaceflight is distinguished from spaceflight generally, which entails both crewed and uncrewed spacecraft. There are two definitions of spaceflight. The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), an international record-keeping body, defines the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and outer space at 100 kilometers above sea level. This boundary is known as the Kármán line . Additionally, the United States military awards astronaut wings to qualified personnel who pilot a spaceflight above an altitude of 50 miles (80 km). Thirteen flights of the North American X-15 met the latter criteria, while only two met the former. This article is primarily concerned with the former international convention, and also lists flights which only satisfied the latter convention. Unless otherwise specified, "spaceflight" and related terms only apply to flights which went beyond the Kármán line. As of the launch of Soyuz MS-11 on 3 December 2018, there have been 324 human spaceflight launch attempts, including three failed attempts which did not cross the Kármán line. These were the fatal Challenger disaster , and two non-fatal aborted Soyuz missions, T-10a and MS-10 . Another non-fatal aborted Soyuz mission, 18a , nevertheless crossed the Kármán line and therefore qualified as a sub-orbital spaceflight . Three missions successfully achieved human spaceflight, yet ended as fatal failures as their crews died during the return. These were Soyuz 1 , Soyuz 11 , and the Columbia disaster . Uniquely, Soyuz 34 was launched uncrewed to the Salyut 6 space station, to provide a successful return vehicle for the crew of Soyuz 32 . Including Soyuz 34 gives a total of 325 attempted human spaceflights. 13 flights reached an apogee beyond 50 miles, but failed to go beyond 100 kilometers. Summary Since 1961, three countries and one private business have conducted human spaceflight using twelve different spacecraft series, or: "programs", "projects". Human spaceflights The Salyut series, Skylab , Mir , ISS , and Tiangong series space stations, with which many of these flights docked in orbit, are not listed separately here. See the detailed lists (links below) for information. Missions which were intended to reach space but which failed to do so are listed in italics , and fatal missions are marked with asterisks. Flights between 50 miles and 100 kilometers In addition to the above, 13 flights reached an apogee between 50 mi and 100 km, thus qualifying as spaceflights according to the American convention, but failing the FAI criterion. Most of these were X-15 flights during the 1960s, but in 2018 two additional flights reached an apogee between 50 mi and 100 km.

Russia inherited the Soviet Union's space program following the dissolution of the Soviet Union . ^ Dates in this table refer only to actual flights, and not the broader duration of their associated programs. For example, while Project Gemini was begun in 1961 and concluded in 1966, its crewed spaceflights occurred only from 1965–1966. ^ Soyuz missions include the following: two fatal missions, Soyuz 1 and Soyuz 11 , both of which reached space; Soyuz 18a , a non-fatal aborted mission which reached space as a sub-orbital flight; Soyuz 19 , the Soviet participant in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project ; Soyuz 34 , which was launched uncrewed to provide a return vehicle for the crew of Soyuz 32 , who were aboard the Salyut 6 space station; Soyuz T-10a , a non-fatal accident in which the crewed launch was aborted due to a fire, failing to reach space; and Soyuz MS-10 , a non-fatal aborted mission which failed to reach space. ^ Following the Apollo program, the Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz flights also used Apollo hardware. ^ Includes two fatal missions, STS-51-L , and STS-107 . The former did not reach space, while the latter did. External links Spacefacts Compare with the present article. The Spacefacts list includes most flights listed here, but omits twelve: The three failed launches of STS-51-L, Soyuz T-10a and Soyuz MS-10, none of which achieved human spaceflight, the uncrewed launch of Soyuz 34 (which nevertheless returned a crew to earth), and the eight sub-orbital human spaceflights: Mercury-Redstone 3 and 4, X-15 flights 90 and 91, SpaceShipOne flights 15P, 16P and 17P, and Soyuz 18a.
