List_of_missions_to_the_outer_planets
 A total of nine spacecraft have been launched on missions that involve visits to the outer planets; all nine missions involve encounters with Jupiter , with four spacecraft also visiting Saturn . One spacecraft, Voyager 2 , also visited Uranus and Neptune . The nine missions include two; Ulysses and New Horizons , whose primary objectives are not related to the outer planets, but which flew past Jupiter to gain gravity assists en route to a polar orbit around the Sun, and Pluto —at the time of its launch considered an outer planet—respectively. Cassini–Huygens also flew past Jupiter for a gravity assist on its mission to explore Saturn. Only three of the missions to the outer planets have been orbiters: Galileo orbited Jupiter for eight years, while Cassini orbited Saturn for thirteen years. Juno has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016. Jupiter Six spacecraft have been launched to explore Jupiter , with an additional three spacecraft making gravity-assist flybys without the exploration of Jupiter being one of their primary objectives. Missions whose primary objectives were not related to the exploration of Jupiter are indicated in grey Saturn Four spacecraft have visited Saturn; Pioneer 11 , Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 made flybys, while Cassini–Huygens entered orbit, and deployed a probe into the atmosphere of Titan. Uranus Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Uranus, making a single flyby as part of its grand tour of the outer planets. Neptune Voyager 2 is also the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune, making a single flyby as part of its grand tour of the outer planets.
