 Jorge de Menezes (c. 1498 – 1537) was a Portuguese explorer, who in 1526–27 landed on the islands of Biak ( Cenderawasih Bay ), whilst he awaited the passing of the monsoon season, and on the northern coasts of the Bird's Head Peninsula , calling the region Ilhas dos Papuas . He is thus credited with the European discovery of New Guinea . Jorge de Menezes was the Portuguese Governor of the Moluccas from 1527 until 1530, residing on Ternate . While in office, he plundered a Spanish fort on Tidore , poisoned the sultan of Ternate and committed atrocities against the local population. Subsequently he was arrested and sent to Portuguese India . After his return to Portugal he was banished to the colony of Brazil , where he died in combat against Indians in 1537.
