the australian broadcasting corporation abc is australias national broadcaster founded in 1929 it is currently principally funded by direct grants from the australian government but is expressly independent of government and partisan politics the abc plays a leading role in journalistic independence and is fundamental in the history of broadcasting in australia
modelled on the bbc in the united kingdom it was originally financed by consumer licence fees on broadcasting receivers licence fees were abolished in 1973 and replaced principally by direct government grants as well as revenue from commercial activities related to its core broadcasting mission
the abc now provides television radio online and mobile services throughout metropolitan and regional australia and overseas through abc australia and radio australia the abc headquarters is in ultimo an inner-city suburb of sydney new south wales


 origin 
founded in 1929 as the australian broadcasting company the abc was a government licensed consortium of private entertainment and content providers authorised under supervision to broadcast on the airwaves using a two-tiered system the a system derived its funds primarily from the licence fees levied on the purchasers of the radio receivers with an emphasis on building the radio wave infrastructure into regional and remote areas whilst the b system relied on privateers and their capacity to establish viable enterprises using the new technology following the general downward economic trends of the era as entrepreneurial ventures in national infrastructure struggled with viability the company was subsequently acquired to become a fully state-owned corporation on 1 july 1932 and renamed as australian broadcasting commission re-aligning more closely to the british bbc model
the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983 changed the name of the organisation to the australian broadcasting corporation effective 1 july 1983 although funded and owned by the government the abc remains editorially independent as ensured through the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983the abc is sometimes informally referred to as aunty originally in imitation of the british broadcasting corporations nickname


 history 


 1920s–40s 

the first public radio station in australia opened in sydney on 23 november 1923 under the call sign 2sb with other stations in melbourne brisbane adelaide perth and hobart following a licensing scheme administered by the postmaster-generals department was soon established allowing certain stations government funding albeit with restrictions placed on their advertising contentfollowing a 1927 royal commission inquiry into radio licensing issues the government established the national broadcasting service which subsequently took over a number of the larger funded stations it also nationalised the australian broadcasting company which had been created by entertainment interests to supply programs to various radio stations on 1 july 1932 the australian broadcasting commission was established taking over the operations of the national broadcasting service and eventually establishing offices in each of australias capital cities

over the next four years the stations were reformed into a cohesive broadcasting organisation through regular program relays coordinated by a centralised bureaucracy the australian broadcast radio spectrum was constituted of the abc and the commercial sectornews broadcasts were initially restricted due to pressure from sir keith murdoch who controlled many australian newspapers however journalists such as frank dixon and john hinde began to subvert the agreements in the late 1930s in 1939 warren denning was appointed to canberra as the first abc political correspondent after murdoch had refused to allow his newspapers to cover a speech by joseph lyonsin 1942 the australian broadcasting act was passed giving the abc the power to decide when and in what circumstances political speeches should be broadcast directions from the minister about whether or not to broadcast any matter now had to be made in writing and any exercise of the power had to be mentioned in the commissions annual report it was used only once in 1963 in the same year kindergarten of the air began on abc radio in perth and was later broadcast nationally


 1950s–70s 

the abc commenced television broadcasting in 1956 and followed the earlier radio practice of naming the station after the first letter of the base state abn-2 new south wales sydney was inaugurated by prime minister robert menzies on 5 november 1956 with the first broadcast presented by michael charlton and james dibble reading the first television news bulletin abv-2 melbourne victoria followed two weeks later on 18 november 1956 stations in other capital cities followed abq-2 brisbane queensland 1959 abs-2 adelaide south australia 1960 abw-2 perth western australia 1960 and abt-2 hobart tasmania 1960 abc-3 canberra opened in 1961 and abd-6 darwin northern territory started broadcasting in 1971 both named after the base city
although radio programs could be distributed nationally by landline television relay facilities were not in place until the early 1960s this meant that news bulletins had to be sent to each capital city by teleprinter to be prepared and presented separately in each city with filmed materials copied manually and sent to each state other television programs at the time included the popular six oclock rock hosted by johnny okeefe mr squiggle as well as operas and playsin 1973 new south wales rugby league boss kevin humphreys negotiated rugby leagues first television deal with the abc
in 1975 colour television was introduced into australia and within a decade the abc had moved into satellite broadcasting greatly enhancing its ability to distribute content nationally in the same year the abc introduced a 24-hour-a-day am rock station in sydney 2jj double jay which was eventually expanded into the national triple j fm network a year later a national classical music network was established on the fm band broadcasting from adelaide it was initially known as abc-fm now called abc classic fm – referring both to its fine music programming and radio frequencyabc budget cuts began in 1976 and continued until 1985 in 1978 the abc nsw staff association organised a strike against budget cuts and political interference sydney abc was off air for four days a packed free concert in support was held at the regent theatre and compered by bob hudson it featured fred dagg and robyn archer in 1991 tom molomby wrote

the effects of the budget reductions had been so badly handled that the organisation was to remain seriously crippled for years


 1980s–90s 
the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983 changed the name of the organisation from the australian broadcasting commission to the australian broadcasting corporation effective 1 july 1983 at the same time the newly formed corporation underwent significant restructuring the abc was split into separate television and radio divisions with an overhaul of management finance property and engineering geoffrey whitehead was the initial managing director however following his resignation in 1986 david hill at the time chair of the abc board took over his position
program production in indigenous affairs comedy social history and current affairs was significantly expanded while the corporations output of drama was boosted local production trebled from 1986–91 with the assistance of co-production co-financing and pre-sales arrangementsa new concert music department was formed in 1985 to co-ordinate the corporations six symphony orchestras which in turn received a greater level of autonomy to better respond to local needs open-air free concerts and tours educational activities and joint ventures with other music groups were undertaken at the time to expand the orchestras audience reachabc radio was restructured significantly again in 1985 – radio one became the metropolitan network while radio 2 became known as radio national callsigns however were not standardised until 1990 new programs such as the world today australia all over and the coodabeen champions were introduced while abc-fm established an australian music unit in 1989 radio australia began to focus on the asia-pacific region with coverage targeted at the south west and central pacific south-east asia and north asia radio australia also carried more news coverage with special broadcasts during the 1987 fijian coup tiananmen square massacre and the first gulf war

in 1991 the corporations sydney radio and orchestral operations moved to a new building in the inner-city suburb of ultimo in melbourne the abc southbank centre was completed in 1994 and now houses the radio division in victoria as well as the melbourne symphony orchestrathe abc multimedia unit was established in july 1995 to manage the new abc website launched in august funding was allocated later that year specifically for online content as opposed to reliance on funding for television and radio content the first online election coverage was put together in 1996 and included news electorate maps candidate information and live resultsby the early 1990s all major abc broadcasting outlets moved to 24-hour-a-day operation while regional radio coverage in australia was extended with 80 new transmitters live television broadcasts of selected parliamentary sessions started in 1990 abc newsradio a continuous news network broadcast on the parliamentary and news network when parliament is not sitting was launched on 5 october 1994international television service australia television international was established in 1993 while at the same time radio australia increased its international reach reduced funding in 1997 for radio australia resulted in staff and programming cutsaustralia television was sold to the seven network in 1998 however the service continued to show abc news and current affairs programming up until its closure in 2001 the abcs television operation joined its radio and online divisions at the corporations ultimo headquarters in 2000


 2000s 
in 2001 digital television commenced after four years of preparation in readiness the abc had fully digitised its production post-production and transmission facilities – heralded at the time as the greatest advance in television technology since the introduction of colour the first programmes to be produced in widescreen were drama series something in the air grass roots and in the mind of the architect
at the same time the abcs multimedia division was renamed abc new media becoming an output division of the abc alongside television and radio legislation allowed the abc to provide multichannels – additional digital-only television services managed by the new media division soon after the introduction of digital television in 2001 fly tv and the abc kids channel launched showing a mix of programming aimed at teenagers and children
in 2002 the abc launched abc asia pacific – the replacement for the defunct australia television international operated previously by the seven network much like its predecessor and companion radio network radio australia the service provided a mix of programming targeted at audiences throughout the asia-pacific region funding cuts in 2003 led to the closure of fly tv and the abc kids channel
the abc launched a digital radio service abc dig in november 2002 available though the internet and digital television but not available through any other terrestrial broadcast until dab became available in 2009
abc2 a second attempt at a digital-only television channel launched on 7 march 2005 unlike its predecessors the new service was not dependent on government funding instead running on a budget of a3 million per year minister for communications helen coonan inaugurated the channel at parliament house three days later genre restrictions limiting the types of programming the channel could carry were lifted in october 2006 – abc2 was henceforth able to carry programming classified as comedy drama national news sport and entertainmenta high incidence of breast cancer in female staff working at the abcs offices in brisbane led to the closure of the site based in toowong on 21 december 2006 sixteen women were diagnosed with the disease in a period spanning 1994 to 2007 a progress report released in march 2007 by an independent panel formed to investigate the occurrences found that the rate of occurrence for breast cancer rate at the offices was eleven times higher than elsewhere – after the closure of the site the abcs brisbane-based television and radio operations were moved to alternate locations around the city including ten brisbanes studios at mt coot-tha the abcs managing director mark scott announced in august 2007 that new studios would be built on the site following the final release of the review and scientific investigation panels report in january 2012 the abc in brisbane moved into purpose-built accommodation in south bankon 8 february 2008 abc tv was rebranded as abc1 complementing the existing abc2 digital-only channel which was launched on 7 march 2005 branding was also added for a new kids channel that had been announced throughout the howard government based on their winning the 2007 election but left to the 2009 rudd government budget where abc3 was funded and announced in june a new online video-on-demand service launched in july of the same year titled abc iview and the abc launched digital radio broadcasts in the same month


 2010s 
abc news launched on 22 july 2010 and brought with it both new programming content as well as a collaboration of existing news and current affair productions and resources the abc launched the 24-hour news channel to both complement its existing 24-hour abc news radio service and compete with commercial offerings on cable tv it became the abcs fifth domestic tv channel and the fourth launched within the past 10 years
on 20 july 2014 abc1 reverted to its original name of abcin 2014 the abc ran its first mental as week focusing on improving awareness of mental health issues as part of mental health weekin december 2015 it was announced that former bskyb star tv and google executive michelle guthrie would take over from managing director mark scott who was to retire in april 2016in june 2018 the liberal partys annual federal council voted to privatise the abc the decision is not binding on the federal government so is seen as unlikely to impact government policyin september 2018 it was announced that michelle guthrie had left the position of managing director after directors resolved that it was not in the best interests of the abc for ms guthrie to continue to lead the organisationit was reported in february 2019 that australian prime minister scott morrison has been given a shortlist of potential candidates for the role of abc chairman after the company has gone without a chairman or managing director for over four months the recruitment process has been started by the global recruitment firm korn ferry the final choice for chairman has yet to be sent to the cabinet for approval the abc board has started the search for a new managing director even though the chairman has yet to be appointed 


 corporation 


 structure 
below is a diagram of the abcs divisional structure


 management 

the operations of the abc are governed by a board of directors consisting of a managing director five to seven directors and until 2006 a staff-elected director the managing director is appointed by the board for a period of up to five years but is eligible for renewal the authority and guidelines for the appointment of directors is provided for in the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983appointments to the abc board made by successive governments have often resulted in criticism of the appointees political affiliation background and relative merit past appointments have associated directly with political parties – five of fourteen appointed chairmen have been accused of political affiliation or friendship include richard downing and ken myer both of whom publicly endorsed the australian labor party at the 1972 election as well as sir henry bland  david hill was close to neville wran while donald mcdonald was considered to be a close friend of john howard
from 2003 the howard government made several controversial appointments to the abc board including prominent abc critic janet albrechtsen ron brunton and keith windschuttleduring their 2007 federal election campaign labor announced plans to introduce a new system similar to that of the bbc for appointing members to the board under the new system candidates for the abc board would be considered by an independent panel established at arms length from the communications minister if the minister chose someone not on the panels shortlist they would be required to justify this to parliament the abc chairman would be nominated by the prime minister and endorsed by the leader of the oppositionthe new merit-based appointment system was announced on 16 october in advance of the new triennial funding period starting in 2009current board members are


 funding 
the abc is funded mainly by the australian government in addition to some revenue received from its retail outlets government funding to the abc was 1,036.1 million in 2016-17 1,043.7 million in 2017-18 and is estimated at 1,045.9 million in 2018-19until 1948 the abc was funded directly by radio licence fees amendments were also made to the australian broadcasting act that meant the abc would receive its funding directly from the federal government licence fees remained until 1973 when they were abolished by the whitlam labor government on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcasters
the term where your 8 cents a day goes coined in the late 1980s during funding negotiations is often used in reference to the services provided by the abc it is estimated that the cost of the abc per head of population per day was 7.1 cents a day based on the corporations 2007–08 base funding of 543 million  based on funding of 1043.7m in 2017/18 and an australian population of 24.8m a more current calculation gives a cost of about 12 cents a day


 politics and criticism 


 independence and impartiality 
under the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983 the abc board is bound to maintain the independence and integrity of the corporation and to ensure that the gathering and presentation by the corporation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognized standards of objective journalism
in relation to impartiality and diversity of perspectives the current abc editorial policy requires of the broadcaster that
 the abc gather and present news and information with impartiality and presents a diversity of perspectives so that over time no significant strand of thought or belief within the community is knowingly excluded or disproportionately represented the broadcaster is expected to take no editorial stance other than a commitment to fundamental democratic principles


 criticisms 
as a publicly funded broadcaster the abc is expected not to take editorial stances on political issues and is required to present a range of views with impartiality over the decades accusations of bias at the abc have arisen at different times and various inquiries undertaken
reviews of the abc are regularly commissioned and sometimes not released

the abcs requirement of impartiality has led to persistent debates external critics have complained in particular of left-wing political bias at the broadcaster citing a prominence of labor party-connected journalists hosting masthead political programs or a tendency to favour progressive over conservative political views on issues such as immigration refugees the republic multiculturalism reconciliation  feminism environmentalism anti-americanism gay marriage budgeting and the likeinternal and external reports have drawn different conclusions on the question of bias at the abc a 2013 university of the sunshine coast study of the voting intentions of journalists found that 73.6 per cent of abc journalists supported labor or the greens - with 41% supporting the greens whereas only around 10% of people in the general population voted green a 2004 roy morgan media credibility survey found that journalists regarded abc radio as the most accurate news source in the country and the abc as the second most politically biased media organisation in
australia”   a 2009 study by academics joshua gans and andrew leigh found the abc overall close to the center position but with its television news significantly slanted towards the coalition malcolm turnbull the prime minister of australia commented on 3aw radio in 2018 that “some” journalists and programs contain a left-wing bias conservative commentators such as andrew bolt tim blair and gerard henderson accuse the abc of a left-wing bias in rejecting criticisms of bias abc journalist annabel crabb said in 2015 that the organisation gives voices to australians who otherwise wouldnt be heard on topics that are too uncommercial or too remote or too hard to be covered by anyone else broadcasting into areas from which others have long withdrawn resources abc journalist turned nsw liberal mla pru goward said of the organisation  i have no doubt there was left-wing bias i certainly thought it when i was there while abc journalist turned federal labor politician maxine mckew said there was no left wing bias though what i detected years ago in the abc much more of a collectivist philosophyat the most recent federal election in 2016 a study commissioned by the abc and conducted by isentia compiled share-of-voice data and found that the abc devoted 42.6% of election coverage to the coalition government this compares to the 42.04% vote received by the coalition in the house of representatives hor 35.9% to the labor opposition 34.73% hor 8% to the greens 10.23% hor 3.1% to independents 1.85% hor 2.2% to nick xenophons team 1.85% hor and 8.1% to the rest however the abc itself notes the significant limitations around the value of share of voice data as duration says nothing about tone or context


 from hawke to rudd 
labor prime minister bob hawke considered the abcs coverage of the 1991 gulf war to be biased in 1996 conservative opposition leader john howard refused to have kerry obrien of the abc moderate the television debates with labor prime minister paul keating because howard saw obrien as biased against the coalitionduring the subsequent howard government years abc tvs masthead political programs were anchored by journalists with labor affiliations the 7.30 report was hosted by former whitlam staffer kerry obrien the insiders program by former hawke staffer barrie cassidy and the lateline program by maxine mckew who went on to defeat liberal prime minister john howard as the labor candidate for the seat of bennelong in 2007 at the same time as abc sydney news weatherman mike bailey ran for labor against liberal minister joe hockeyin the subsequent rudd-gillard period cassidy retained his position at insiders while obrien shifted to host four corners in 2011chris uhlmann husband of labor mp gai brodtmann was appointed as co-host of the 7.30 current affairs program and sydney abc news anchor juanita phillips began a relationship with labors minister for climate change greg combet


 abbott-turnbull-morrison government 2013–present 
liberal prime minister tony abbott perceived the abc to be left wing and hostile to his government while his successor malcolm turnbull enjoyed better relations with the national broadcaster when the abc co-published  stolen documents purportedly revealing australian spy agency activities overseas abbott told 2gb radio people feel at the moment that the abc instinctively takes everyones side but australias he reportedly called the qa program a lefty lynch mob abbott denounced the program for inviting zaky mallah a man convicted of threatening commonwealth officials to participate in questioning one of his ministers asking whose side are you on abbott initiated a brief ministerial boycott of the qa program following the affairthe broadcaster was critical of abbott when he broke an election-eve promise not to make cuts to the abc as part of his budget repair program in early 2015 an internal abc review of its coverage of joe hockeys first budget criticised the post-budget interviews by 730 and lateline finding that the interviewers had given the impression of bias
support for leadership coup against abbottwhen abbott lost the leadership to the less conservative turnbull in the september 2015 liberal leadership spill the hosts of the abcs political programs spoke in favour of abbotts demise kerry obrien and barrie cassidy hosts respectively of the abcs flagship weekly current affairs programs four corners and insiders welcomed the replacement of abbott by turnbull as did abc radio commentators fran kelly paul bongiorno and amanda vanstone fairfax and news limited reported that leigh sales the host of 7.30 gave turnbull an unusually warm first interview following his toppling of abbott
opposition to leadership coup against turnbullwhen turnbull lost the leadership after a conservative challenge in august 2018 the hosts of the abcs political programs denounced the change the 7pm news political correspondent andrew probyn who had been censured by acma earlier in the year for biased reporting against abbott said the removal of turnbull was about vengeance pure and simple earlier in the year insiders barrie  cassidy called it insanity and madness  730 chief political correspondent laura tingle was selected by turnbull first among a handful of journalists to ask questions at his final press conference she said one of frustrations that voters have had with your prime ministership is the sense that you have conceded too regularly to the conservatives vanstone called the challenge disgraceful
management responses to biasin a march 2016 interview with abc managing director mark scott media watch host paul barry examined the question of perceptions of left wing bias at the abc scott noted that while perhaps the abc was more concerned about gay marriage than about electricity prices he did not accept the criticism of bias because a lot of that criticism comes from right wing commentators and they wonder where are the strong right wing commentators on the abc we dont do that kind of journalism we dont ask questions about our journalists voting pattern and where their ideology are we look at the journalism that they put to air and we have strong editorial standards following the interview conservative abc critic andrew bolt wrote how can the man heading our biggest media organisation be so blind to the abcs unlawful and dangerous leftist bias while former media watch host jonathan holmes wrote for the age that this interview indicated that abc management had failed to recognise a clear problem of left wing bias among some capital city radio presentersover the period abc tv and radio hosts advocated strongly in support of same-sex marriage upon which the wider australian community and political parties were divided when the turnbull government announced plans for a postal plebiscite on the issue advocacy for change continued prompting a call for restraint from the abcs editorial policy manager mark maleyan interview by abc presenter joe obrien with lyle shelton was the subject of a complaint by the australian christian lobby bringing up ian thorpes swimming achievements obrien asked shelton what right do you have to participate in that joy and take national pride in those achievements if you now deny him the right to feel like an equal and experience the joy of marriage in rejecting any perceived bias the abc said it was a devils advocate question and not inconsistent with standards


 australia day 
the abc is criticised for allegedly giving undue support to opposition to australia day being held on 26 january in 2017 the abcs youth radio network announced that after extensive consultation and opinion polling it would no longer play its hottest 100 australian music list on australia day choosing instead to broadcast the playlist on the fourth weekend in january the federal communications minister mitch fifield said in response i am bewildered by the abcs decision to move the hottest 100 from australia day the abc shouldnt be buying into this debate australia day is our national day the abc should honour it and not mess with the hottest 100 in 2018 an opinion piece  appeared on abcs website suggesting the date should be moved to 1 january citing symbolism  justin milne the chair of the abc board held a meeting trying to convince the board to overrule triple js decision


 coverage of the catholic church 
the abcs coverage of the catholic church has been controversial conservative commentator gerard henderson has written that the the abc’s focus on historic child sexual abuse in the catholic church stands in contrast to its failure to cover the public broadcaster’s own history in this area in the aftermath of the overturned conviction of adelaide archbishop phillip wilson in 2018 and the appealed conviction of cardinal george pell by a jury in 2019 journalist paul kelly wrote that calculated media assaults on pell had been spearheaded by the abc contributing to an intense and unjustified public hatred of the catholic leader and prejudicial environment in which to conduct a trial


 abc journalists in politics 
a number of former journalists and presenters have moved from positions at the abc to politics
state labor premiers and chief ministers bob carralan carpenter
and clare martin are all former abc journalists other abc journalists who stood as labor candidates include mary delahunty maxine mckew  mike bailey ian baker leon bignell john bowler bob debus malarndirri mccarthy frank mcguire neville oliver and diana warnock senior abc political reporter kerry obrien was press secretary to labor prime minister gough whitlam and labor deputy leader lionel bowen and barrie cassidy was press secretary to labor prime minister bob hawke susan templemans husband ron fuller is the former chief of staff for abc tv news radio nationals phillip adams is a former member of the communist party of australia and the labor party and melbourne abc radios jon faine is a former member of the labor partyon the coalition side of politics  pru goward has served as a minister in the nsw state liberal government rob messenger peter collins eoin cameron scott emerson and sarah henderson all held or hold positions at the abc radio nationals counterpoint program is hosted by former liberal minister amanda vanstone who describes herself as liberal rather than conservativeresearch undertaken by the broadcaster in 2007 indicated that out of a total of 19 former employees moving into party political positions 10 have joined the labor party and nine the liberal party
