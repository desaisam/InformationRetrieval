 history 


 prehistory and antiquity 
 

human remains found in peștera cu oase cave with bones radiocarbon dated as being from circa 40,000 years ago represent the oldest known homo sapiens in europe neolithic techniques and agriculture spread after the arrival of a mixed group of people from thessaly in the 6th millenium bc excavations near a salt spring at lunca yielded the earliest evidence for salt exploitation in europe here the production of salt started between 6050 and 5900 bc the first permanent settlements also appeared in the neolithic some of them developed into proto-cities which were larger than 800 acres 3.2 km2 the cucuteni–trypillia culture—the best known archaeological culture of old europe—flourished in muntenia southeastern transylvania and northeastern moldavia in the 3rd millenium bc the first fortified settlements appeared around 1800 bc showing the militant character of bronze age societies

 
greek colonies established on the black sea coast in the 7th century bc became important centers of commerce with the local tribes among the native peoples herodotus listed the getae of the lower danube region the agathyrsi of transylvania and the syginnae of the plains along the river tisza at the beginning of the 5th century bc centuries later strabo associated the getae with the dacians who dominated the lands along the southern carpathian mountains in the 1st century bc burebista was the first dacian ruler to unite the local tribes he also conquered the greek colonies in dobruja and the neighboring peoples as far as the middle danube and the balkan mountains between around 55 and 44 bc after burebista was murdered in 44 bc his empire collapsedthe romans reached dacia during burebistas reign and conquered dobruja in 46 ad dacia was again united under decebalus around 85 he resisted the romans for decades but the roman army annihilated his troops in 106 emperor trajan transformed banat oltenia and the greater part of transylvania into the new roman province of dacia but dacian germanic and sarmatian tribes continued to dominate the lands along the roman frontiers the romans pursued an organized colonization policy and the provincials enjoyed a long period of peace and prosperity in the 2nd century scholars accepting the daco-roman continuity theory—one of the main theories about the origin of the romanians—say that the cohabitation of the native dacians and the roman colonists in roman dacia was the first phase of the romanians ethnogenesis

the carpians goths and other neighboring tribes made regular raids against dacia from the 210s the romans could not resist and emperor aurelian ordered the evacuation of the province dacia trajana in 271 scholars supporting the continuity theory are convinced that most latin-speaking commoners stayed behind when the army and civil administration was withdrawn the romans did not abandon their fortresses along the northern banks of the lower danube for decades and dobruja known as scythia minor remained an integral part of the roman empire until the early 7th century


 middle ages 

subsequently as the high middle ages came to an end and the late middle ages began many small romanian-speaking states with varying degrees of independence developed but only under the reigns of basarab i and bogdan i the larger principalities of wallachia and moldavia would emerge in the 14th centuryunder radu i and his successor dan i the realms in transylvania and severin continued to be disputed with hungary while wallachia and moldavia remained largely independent from the kingdom of hungary yet soon enough being forced to withstand the ottoman threat from the east

by 1541 the entire balkan peninsula and most of the high medieval hungarian kingdom had already been conquered and integrated into the ottoman empire in stark contrast moldavia wallachia and transylvania while still under ottoman suzerainty preserved partial or full internal autonomy way until the mid-19th century transylvania until 1711 this period featured several prominent rulers such as stephen the great vasile lupu alexander the good and dimitrie cantemir in moldavia vlad the impaler mircea the elder matei basarab neagoe basarab and constantin brâncoveanu in wallachia and gabriel bethlen in the grand principality of transylvania as well as john hunyadi and matthias corvinus in transylvania while it was still a part of the kingdom of hungaryin 1600 all three principalities were ruled simultaneously by the wallachian prince michael the brave mihai viteazul who was considered later on the precursor of modern romania and became a point of reference for nationalists as well as a catalyst for achieving a single romanian state


 independence and monarchy 

during the period of the austro-hungarian rule in transylvania and of ottoman suzerainty over wallachia and moldavia most romanians were given few rights in a territory where they formed the majority of the population nationalistic themes became principal during the wallachian uprising of 1821 and the 1848 revolutions in wallachia and moldavia the flag adopted for wallachia by the revolutionaries was a blue-yellow-red horizontal tricolour with blue above in line with the meaning liberty justice fraternity while romanian students in paris hailed the new government with the same flag as a symbol of union between moldavians and wallachians the same flag with the tricolour being mounted vertically would later be officially adopted as the national flag of romaniaafter the failed 1848 revolutions not all the great powers supported the romanians expressed desire to officially unite in a single state but in the aftermath of the crimean war the electors in both moldavia and wallachia voted in 1859 for the same leader alexandru ioan cuza as domnitor ruling prince in romanian and the two principalities became a personal union formally under the suzerainty of the ottoman empire following a coup détat in 1866 cuza was exiled and replaced with prince carol i of romania of the house of hohenzollern-sigmaringen during the 1877–1878 russo-turkish war romania fought on the russian side and in the aftermath it was recognized as an independent state both by the ottoman empire and the great powers by the treaty of san stefano and the treaty of berlin the new kingdom of romania underwent a period of stability and progress until 1914 and also acquired southern dobruja from bulgaria after the second balkan war


 world wars and greater romania 

romania remained neutral for the first two years of world war i following the secret treaty of bucharest according to which romania would acquire territories with a majority of romanian population from austria-hungary it joined the entente powers and declared war on 27 august 1916 after initial advances the romanian military campaign quickly turned disastrous for romania as the central powers occupied two-thirds of the country within months before reaching a stalemate in 1917 the october revolution and russian withdrawal from the war left romania alone and surrounded and a cease fire was negotiated at focșani that december

romania was occupied and a harsh peace treaty was signed in may 1918 in november romania reentered the conflict total military and civilian losses from 1916 to 1918 within contemporary borders were estimated at 748,000 after the war the transfer of bukovina from austria was acknowledged by the 1919 treaty of saint germain transylvania and parts of banat crișana and maramureș  from hungary by the 1920 treaty of trianon and of bessarabia from russian rule by the 1920 treaty of paris all cessions made to the central powers in the ceasefire and treaty were nullified and renouncedthe following interwar period is referred as greater romania as the country achieved its greatest territorial extent at that time almost 300,000 km2 or 120,000 sq mi radical agricultural reforms and a new constitution creating a democracy allowed rapid economic growth with oil production of 7.2 million tons in 1937 romania ranked second in europe and seventh in the world and was europes second-largest food producer however the early 1930s were marked by social unrest high unemployment and strikes and there were over 25 governments in the course of the decade on several occasions in the last few years before world war ii the democratic parties were squeezed between conflicts with the fascist and chauvinistic iron guard and the authoritarian tendencies of king carol ii

during world war ii romania tried again to remain neutral but on 28 june 1940 it received a soviet ultimatum with an implied threat of invasion in the event of non-compliance again foreign powers created heavy pressure on romania by means of the molotov–ribbentrop pact of non-aggression from 23 august 1939 as a result of it the romanian government and the army were forced to retreat from bessarabia as well as from northern bukovina in order to avoid war with the soviet union the king was compelled to abdicate and appointed general ion antonescu as the new prime minister with full powers in ruling the state by royal decree romania was prompted to join the axis military campaign thereafter southern dobruja was ceded to bulgaria while hungary received northern transylvania as result of an axis powers arbitration

the antonescu fascist regime played a major role in the holocaust in romania and copied the nazi policies of oppression and genocide of jews and roma mainly in the eastern territories reoccupied by the romanians from the soviet union in total between 280,000 and 380,000 jews in romania including bessarabia bukovina and the transnistria governorate were killed during the war
and at least 11,000 romanian gypsies roma were also killed in august 1944 a coup détat led by king michael toppled ion antonescu and his regime antonescu was convicted of war crimes and executed on 1 june 1946 9 october is now the national day of commemorating the holocaust in romaniaduring the antonescu fascist regime romanian contribution to operation barbarossa was enormous with the romanian army of over 1.2 million men in the summer of 1941 fighting in numbers second only to nazi germany
romania was the main source of oil for the third reich and thus became the target of intense bombing by the allies growing discontent among the population eventually peaked in august 1944 with king michaels coup and the country switched sides to join the allies it is estimated that the coup shortened the war by as much as six months even though the romanian army had suffered 170,000 casualties after switching sides romanias role in the defeat of nazi germany was not recognized by the paris peace conference of 1947 as the soviet union annexed bessarabia and other territories corresponding roughly to present-day republic of moldova and bulgaria retained southern dobruja but romania did regain northern transylvania from hungary


 communism 

during the soviet occupation of romania the communist-dominated government called for new elections in 1946 which were fraudulently won with a fabricated 70% majority of the vote thus they rapidly established themselves as the dominant political force gheorghe gheorghiu-dej a communist party leader imprisoned in 1933 escaped in 1944 to become romanias first communist leader in 1947 he and others forced king michael i to abdicate and leave the country and proclaimed romania a peoples republic romania remained under the direct military occupation and economic control of the ussr until the late 1950s during this period romanias vast natural resources were continuously drained by mixed soviet-romanian companies sovroms set up for unilateral exploitative purposesin 1948 the state began to nationalize private firms and to collectivize agriculture until the early 1960s the government severely curtailed political liberties and vigorously suppressed any dissent with the help of the securitate the romanian secret police during this period the regime launched several campaigns of purges in which numerous enemies of the state and parasite elements were targeted for different forms of punishment such as deportation internal exile and internment in forced labour camps and prisons sometimes for life as well as extrajudicial killing nevertheless anti-communist resistance was one of the most long-lasting in the eastern bloc a 2006 commission estimated the number of direct victims of the communist repression at two million people

in 1965 nicolae ceaușescu came to power and started to conduct the foreign policy more independently from the soviet union thus communist romania was the only warsaw pact country which refused to participate in the soviet-led 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia with ceaușescu at the time even publicly condemning the action as a big mistake and a serious danger to peace in europe and to the fate of communism in the world it was also the only communist state to maintain diplomatic relations with israel after 1967s six-day war and established diplomatic relations with west germany the same year at the same time close ties with the arab countries and the plo allowed romania to play a key role in the israel–egypt and israel–plo peace talks

as romanias foreign debt sharply increased between 1977 and 1981 from us3 billion to 10 billion the influence of international financial organizations such as the imf and the world bank grew gradually conflicting with ceaușescus autocratic rule the latter eventually initiated a policy of total reimbursement of the foreign debt by imposing austerity steps that impoverished the population and exhausted the economy the process succeeded in repaying all foreign government debt of romania in 1989 at the same time ceaușescu greatly extended the authority of the securitate secret police and imposed a severe cult of personality which led to a dramatic decrease in the dictators popularity and culminated in his overthrow and eventual execution together with his wife in the violent romanian revolution of december 1989 in which thousands were killed or injured the charges for which they were executed were among others genocide by starvation


 contemporary period 

after the 1989 revolution the national salvation front nsf led by ion iliescu took partial multi-party democratic and free market measures in april 1990 a sit-in protest contesting the results of that years legislative elections and accusing the nsf including iliescu of being made up of former communists and members of the securitate — rapidly grew to become what was called the golaniad the peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence prompting the intervention of coal miners summoned by iliescu this episode has been documented widely by both local and foreign media and is remembered as the june 1990 mineriadthe subsequent disintegration of the front produced several political parties including most notably the social democratic party and the democratic party the former governed romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments with ion iliescu as head of state since then there have been several other democratic changes of government in 1996 emil constantinescu was elected president in 2000 iliescu returned to power while traian băsescu was elected in 2004 and narrowly re-elected in 2009in november 2014 sibiu german hermannstadt mayor klaus johannis was elected president unexpectedly defeating former prime minister victor ponta who had been in the lead in the opinion polls this surprise victory is attributed by many to the romanian diaspora of which almost 50 percent voted for iohannis in the first tour compared to 16 percent for ponta
 
the post-1989 period is also characterized by the fact that most of the former industrial and economic enterprises which were built and operated during the communist period have been closed mainly as a result of the policies of privatization of the post-1989 regimescorruption has also been a major issue in contemporary romanian politics in november 2015 massive anti-corruption protests which developed in the wake of the colectiv nightclub fire led to the resignation of romanias prime minister victor ponta during 2017–2018 in response to measures which were perceived to weaken the fight against corruption some of the biggest protests since 1989 took place in romania with over 500,000 people protesting across the countrynevertheless in recent years many efforts have been made to tackle corruption a national anticorruption directorate was formed in the country in 2002 and according to transparency internationals annual corruption perceptions index romania is now less corrupt than italy or greece and equals neighbouring hungary


 nato and eu integration 

after the end of the cold war romania developed closer ties with western europe and the united states eventually joining nato in 2004 and hosting the 2008 summit in bucharestthe country applied in june 1993 for membership in the european union and became an associated state of the eu in 1995 an acceding country in 2004 and a full member on 1 january 2007during the 2000s romania enjoyed one of the highest economic growth rates in europe and has been referred at times as the tiger of eastern europe this has been accompanied by a significant improvement in living standards as the country successfully reduced internal poverty and established a functional democratic state however romanias development suffered a major setback during the late-2000s recession leading to a large gross domestic product contraction and budget deficit in 2009 this led to romania borrowing from the international monetary fund the worsening economic conditions led to unrest and triggered a political crisis in 2012

romania still faces problems related to infrastructure medical services education and corruption near the end of 2013 the economist reported romania again enjoying booming economic growth at 4.1% that year with wages rising fast and a lower unemployment than in britain economic growth accelerated in the midst of government liberalisations in opening up new sectors to competition and investment—most notably energy and telecoms in 2016 the human development index ranked romania as a nation of very high human developmentfollowing the experience of economic instability throughout the 1990s and the implementation of a free travel agreement with the eu a great number of romanians emigrated to western europe and north america with particularly large communities in italy and spain in 2008 the romanian diaspora was estimated to be at over two million people
