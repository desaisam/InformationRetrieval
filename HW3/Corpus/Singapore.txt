 etymology 

the english name of singapore is an anglicisation of the native malay name for the country singapura which was in turn derived from sanskrit सिंहपुर iast siṃhapura siṃha is lion pura is town or city hence the customary reference to the nation as the lion city and its inclusion in many of the nations symbols eg its coat of arms merlion emblem however it is unlikely that lions ever lived on the island sang nila utama the srivijayan prince said to have founded and named the island singapura perhaps saw a malayan tiger there are however other suggestions for the origin of the name and scholars do not believe that the origin of the name is firmly established the central island has also been called pulau ujong as far back as the third century ce literally island at the end of the malay peninsula in malaysingapore is also referred to as the garden city for its tree-lined streets and greening efforts since independence and the little red dot for how the island-nation is depicted on many maps of the world and asia as a red dot also referred to as the switzerland of asia in 2017 due to its neutrality on international and regional issues


 history 


 ancient singapore 
the greco-roman astronomer ptolemy 90–168 identified a place called sabana in the general area in the second century and the earliest written record of singapore occurs in a chinese account from the third century describing the island of pu luo chung 蒲 罗 中 this was itself a transliteration from the malay name pulau ujong or island at the end of the malay peninsulathe nagarakretagama a javanese epic poem written in 1365 referred to a settlement on the island called tumasik possibly meaning sea town in 1299 according to the malay annals the kingdom of singapura was founded on the island by sang nila utama although the historicity of the accounts as given in the malay annals is the subject of academic debates it is nevertheless known from various documents that singapore in the 14th century then known as temasek was a trading port under the influence of both the majapahit empire and the siamese kingdoms and was a part of the indosphere of greater india these indianized kingdoms a term coined by george cœdès were characterised by surprising resilience political integrity and administrative stability historical sources also indicate that around the end of the 14th century its ruler parameswara was attacked by either the majapahit or the siamese forcing him to move on to melaka where he founded the sultanate of malacca archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on fort canning was abandoned around this time although a small trading settlement continued in singapore for some time afterwards in 1613 portuguese raiders burned down the settlement and the island faded into obscurity for the next two centuries by then singapore was nominally part of the johor sultanate the wider maritime region and much trade was under dutch control for the following period


 british colonisation 

raffles arrived in singapore on 28 january 1819 and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port  the island was then nominally ruled by tengku abdul rahman the sultan of johor who was controlled by the dutch and the bugis however the sultanate was weakened by factional division the temenggong or chief minister tengku abdur rahman and his officials were loyal to tengku rahmans elder brother tengku long who was living in exile in riau with the temenggongs help raffles managed to smuggle tengku long back into singapore he offered to recognise tengku long as the rightful sultan of johor given the title of sultan hussein and provide him with a yearly payment of 5000 and 3000 to the temenggong in return sultan hussein would grant the british the right to establish a trading post on singapore a formal treaty was signed on 6 february 1819 and modern singapore was born

in 1824 the entire island as well as the temenggong became a british possession after a further treaty with the sultan in 1826 singapore became part of the straits settlements under the jurisdiction of british india becoming the regional capital in 1836 prior to raffles arrival there were only about a thousand people living on the island mostly indigenous malays along with a handful of chinese by 1860 the population had swelled to over 80,000 more than half being chinese many of these early immigrants came to work on the pepper and gambier plantations later in the 1890s when the rubber industry also became established in malaya and singapore the island became a global centre for rubber sorting and exportsingapore was not much affected by first world war 1914–18 since the conflict did not spread to southeast asia  the only significant event during the war was a mutiny by the muslim sepoys from british india who were garrisoned in singapore which occurred in 1915  after hearing rumours that they were to be sent off to fight the ottoman empire which was a muslim state the soldiers rebelled they killed their officers and several british civilians before the mutiny was suppressed by non-muslim troops arriving from johore and burma after the first world war the british built the large singapore naval base as part of the defensive singapore strategy originally announced in 1923 the construction of the base proceeded slowly until the japanese invasion of manchuria in 1931 when completed in 1939 at the very large cost of 500 million it boasted what was then the largest dry dock in the world the third-largest floating dock and having enough fuel tanks to support the entire british navy for six months it was defended by heavy 15-inch naval guns stationed at fort siloso fort canning and labrador as well as a royal air force airfield at tengah air base winston churchill touted it as the gibraltar of the east and military discussions often referred to the base as simply east of suez unfortunately it was a base without a fleet the british home fleet was stationed in europe and the british could not afford to build a second fleet to protect its interests in asia the plan was for the home fleet to sail quickly to singapore in the event of an emergency however after world war ii broke out in 1939 the fleet was fully occupied with defending britain


 world war ii 

during the second world war the imperial japanese army invaded british malaya culminating in the battle of singapore when the british force of 60,000 troops surrendered on 15 february 1942 british prime minister winston churchill called the defeat the worst disaster and largest capitulation in british history british losses during the fighting for singapore were heavy with a total of nearly 85,000 personnel captured in addition to losses during the earlier fighting in malaya about 5,000 were killed or wounded of which australians made up the majority japanese casualties during the fighting in singapore amounted to 1,714 killed and 3,378 wounded the occupation was to become a major turning point in the histories of several nations including those of japan britain and the then-colonial state of singapore japanese newspapers triumphantly declared the victory as deciding the general situation of the war singapore was renamed syonan-to 昭南島 shōnan-tō meaning light of the south between 5,000 and 25,000 ethnic chinese people were killed in the subsequent sook ching massacrebritish forces had planned to liberate singapore in 1945 however the war ended before these operations could be carried out it was subsequently re-occupied by british indian and australian forces following the japanese surrender in september meanwhile tomoyuki yamashita was tried by a us military commission for war crimes but not for crimes committed by his troops in malaya or singapore he was convicted and hanged in the philippines on 23 february 1946


 post-war period 

after the japanese surrender to the allies on 15 august 1945 singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder looting and revenge-killing were widespread british troops led by lord louis mountbatten supreme allied commander for southeast asia command returned to singapore to receive formal surrender of the japanese forces in the region from general itagaki seishiro on behalf of general hisaichi terauchi on 12 september 1945 and a british military administration was formed to govern the island until march 1946 much of the infrastructure had been destroyed during the war including harbour facilities at the port of singapore there was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition disease and rampant crime and violence high food prices unemployment and workers discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services by late 1947 the economy began to recover facilitated by a growing demand for tin and rubber around the world but it would take several more years before the economy returned to pre-war levelsthe failure of britain to successfully defend singapore had destroyed its credibility as infallible ruler in the eyes of singaporeans the decades after the war saw a political awakening amongst the local populace and the rise of anti-colonial and nationalist sentiments epitomised by the slogan merdeka or independence in the malay language the british on their part were prepared to gradually increase self-governance for singapore and malaya on 1 april 1946 the straits settlements was dissolved and singapore became a separate crown colony with a civil administration headed by a governor in july 1947 separate executive and legislative councils were established and the election of six members of the legislative council was scheduled in the following year

during the 1950s chinese communists with strong ties to the trade unions and chinese schools waged a guerrilla war against the government leading to the malayan emergency the 1954 national service riots hock lee bus riots and chinese middle schools riots in singapore were all linked to these events david marshall pro-independence leader of the labour front won singapores first general election in 1955 he led a delegation to london but britain rejected his demand for complete self-rule he resigned and was replaced by lim yew hock in 1956 whose policies convinced britain to grant singapore full internal self-government for all matters except defence and foreign affairsduring the may 1959 elections the peoples action party pap won a landslide victory singapore became an internally self-governing state within the commonwealth with lee kuan yew as its first prime minister as a result the 1959 general elections were the first after full internal self-government was granted by the british authorities singapore was not yet fully independent as the british still controlled external affairs such as the military and foreign relations however singapore was now a recognised state governor sir william allmond codrington goode served as the first yang di-pertuan negara head of state and was succeeded by yusof bin ishak


 merger with malaysia 

despite their successes in governing singapore the pap leaders believed that singapores future lay with malaya due to strong ties between the two nations it was thought that the merger would benefit the economy by creating a common market which will support new industries solving the ongoing unemployment woes in singapore however a sizeable pro-communist wing of the pap was strongly opposed to the merger fearing a loss of influence and hence formed the barisan sosialis splitting from the pap this was because the ruling party of malaya united malays national organisation umno was staunchly anti-communist and would support the non-communist faction of pap against them umno who was initially sceptical of the idea of a merger as they distrust the pap government and were concerned that the large chinese population in singapore would alter the racial balance on which their political power base depended changed their minds about the merger after being afraid of being taken over by pro-communists on 27 may 1961 malayas prime minister tunku abdul rahman made a surprise proposal of a federation of malaysia comprising existing federation of malaya singapore brunei and the british borneo territories of north borneo and sarawak the umno leaders believed that the additional malay population in the borneo territories would offset singapores chinese population the british government for its part believed that the merger would prevent singapore from becoming a haven for communism to secure the mandate of the people the pap called for the 1962 merger referendum which provided different terms for merger with malaysia but no options for avoiding it as a result on 16 september 1963 singapore joined with the federation of malaya the crown colony of sarawak and the crown colony of north borneo to form the new federation of malaysia under the terms of the malaysia agreement with singapore being granted a high level of autonomy compared to other states in malaysia

indonesia however opposed the formation of malaysia over its own claims of borneo and launched konfrontasi confrontation in indonesian on 10 march 1965 a bomb planted by indonesian saboteurs on a mezzanine floor of macdonald house exploded killing three people and injuring 33 others it was the deadliest of at least 42 bomb incidents which occurred during  two members of the indonesian marine corps osman bin haji mohamed ali and harun bin said were eventually convicted and executed for the crime the explosion caused 250,000 in damage to macdonald houseeven after the merger the singapore state government and the malaysian central government disagreed on many political and economic issues despite an earlier agreement to establish a common market singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of malaysia in retaliation singapore did not extend to sabah and sarawak the full extent of the loans agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states the situation escalated to such an intensity that talks soon broke down and abusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides this led to communal strife in singapore accumulating to the 1964 race riots in singapore because of this on 7 august 1965 the then malaysian prime minister tunku abdul rahman seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed advised the parliament of malaysia that it should vote to expel singapore from malaysia on 9 august 1965 the malaysian parliament voted 126 to 0 with singaporean delegates not present to move a bill to amend the constitution providing for singapore to separate from the federation of malaysia this gave singapore independence unusually against its own will


 republic of singapore 

singapore gained independence as the republic of singapore remaining within the commonwealth of nations on 9 august 1965 with lee kuan yew and yusof bin ishak as the first prime minister and president respectively race riots broke out once more in 1969 in 1967 the country co-founded the association of southeast asian nations asean lee kuan yews emphasis on rapid economic growth support for business entrepreneurship and limitations on internal democracy shaped singapores policies for the next half-century and the country progressed to a first world country further economic success continued through the 1980s with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real gdp growth averaging at about 8% up until 1999 during the 1980s singapore began to upgrade to higher-technological industries such as the wafer fabrication sector in order to compete with its neighbours which now had cheaper labour singapore changi airport was opened in 1981 and singapore airlines was formed the port of singapore became one of the worlds busiest ports and the service and tourism industries also grew immensely during this period singapore emerged as an important transportation and logistics hub and a major tourist destinationthe pap rule is termed authoritarian by some activists and opposition politicians who see the strict regulation of political and media activities by the government as an infringement on political rights in response the government of singapore underwent several significant political changes by introducing the non-constituency members of parliament in 1984 to allow up to three losing candidates from opposition parties to be appointed as mps group representation constituencies grcs were introduced in 1988 to create multi-seat electoral divisions intended to ensure minority representation in parliament nominated members of parliament were introduced in 1990 to allow non-elected non-partisan mps the constitution was amended in 1991 to provide for an elected president who has veto power in the use of national reserves and appointments to public office

in 1990 goh chok tong succeeded lee and became singapores second prime minister during gohs tenure the country went through some post-independence crises such as the 1997 asian financial crisis and the 2003 sars outbreakin 2004 lee hsien loong the eldest son of lee kuan yew became the countrys third prime minister lee hsien loongs tenure included the 2008 global financial crisis the resolution of a dispute over malayan railways land and the introduction of integrated resorts despite the economys exceptional growth the peoples action party pap suffered its worst election results in 2011 winning 60% of votes amidst hot-button issues of high influx of foreign workers and cost of living on 23 march 2015 lee kuan yew passed away during the 50th year of independence declaring a one-week period of public mourning subsequently the pap maintained its dominance in parliament at the september general elections receiving 69.9% of the popular vote behind the 2001 tally of 75.3% and the 1968 tally of 86.7


 government and politics 

singapore is a parliamentary republic with a westminster system of unicameral parliamentary government representing constituencies the countrys constitution establishes a representative democracy as the political system executive power rests with the cabinet of singapore led by the prime minister and to a much lesser extent the president the president is elected through a popular vote and has veto powers over a specific set of executive decisions such as the use of the national reserves and the appointment of judges but otherwise occupies a largely ceremonial post in 2016 constitutional amendments provide for reserved presidential elections for a ethnic community in singapore if no one from that community has been president for any of the five most recent terms of office of the president in 2017 halimah yacob was unanimously named the first female president of singapore in the first reserved election for the malay community since all other candidates were declared ineligible for the election

freedom house ranks singapore as partly free in its freedom in the world report and the economist ranks singapore as a flawed democracy the second best rank of four in its democracy index the latest elections were in september 2015 with the pap winning 83 of 89 seats contested with 70% of the popular votethe legal system of singapore is based on english common law but with substantial local differences trial by jury was abolished in 1970 so that judicial decisions would rest entirely in the hands of appointed judges singapore has penalties that include judicial corporal punishment in the form of caning which may be imposed for such offences as rape rioting vandalism and certain immigration offences there is capital punishment in singapore for murder as well as for certain aggravated drug-trafficking and firearms offences

amnesty international has said that some legal provisions of the singapore system conflict with the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty the government has disputed amnestys claims stating that their position on abolition of the death penalty is by no means uncontested internationally and that the report contains grave errors of facts and misrepresentations singapores judicial system is considered one of the most reliable in asiasingapore has been consistently rated among the least corrupt countries in the world by transparency international singapores unique combination of a strong almost authoritarian government with an emphasis on meritocracy and good governance is known as the singapore model and is regarded as a key factor behind singapores political stability economic growth and harmonious social order

in 2011 the world justice projects rule of law index ranked singapore among the top countries surveyed with regard to order and security absence of corruption and effective criminal justice however the country received a much lower ranking for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly all public gatherings of five or more people require police permits and protests may legally be held only at the speakers corner


 foreign relations 

singapores foreign policy is aimed at maintaining security in southeast asia and surrounding territories an underlying principle is political and economic stability in the region it has diplomatic relations with more than 180 sovereign states the singaporean passport is second in the world after japan for visa-free travel granted by the most countries to its citizensas singapore has diplomatic relations with both united states and north korea and was one of the few countries that have relationships with both countries on 12 june 2018 singapore hosted a historic summit between us president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong-un the first-ever meeting between the sitting leaders of the two nations the summit took place at the capella resort on the island of sentosa it has also hosted the ma–xi meeting on 7 november 2015
as one of the five founding members of asean it is a strong supporter of the asean free trade area afta and the asean investment area because singapores economy is closely linked to that of the region as a whole former prime minister goh chok tong proposed the formation of an asean economic community a step beyond the current afta bringing it closer to a common market this was agreed to in 2007 for implementation by 2015 other regional organisations are important to singapore and it is the host of the apec secretariat singapore maintains membership in other regional organisations such as asia–europe meeting the forum for east asia-latin american cooperation the indian ocean rim association and the east asia summit it is also a member of the non-aligned movement and the commonwealth while singapore is not a formal member of the g20 it has been invited to participate in g20 processes in most years since 2010

in general bilateral relations with other asean members are strong however disagreements have arisen and relations with neighbouring malaysia and indonesia have sometimes been strained malaysia and singapore have clashed over the delivery of fresh water to singapore and access by the singapore armed forces to malaysian airspace border issues exist with malaysia and indonesia and both have banned the sale of marine sand to singapore over disputes about singapores land reclamation some previous disputes such as the pedra branca dispute have been resolved by the international court of justice piracy in the strait of malacca has been a cause of concern for all three countries close economic ties exist with brunei and the two share a pegged currency value through a currency interchangeability agreement between the two countries which makes both brunei dollar and singapore dollar banknotes and coins legal tender in either country

the first diplomatic contact with china was made in the 1970s with full diplomatic relations established in the 1990s since then the two countries have been major players in strengthening the asean–china relationship and has maintained a long-standing and greatly prioritised close relationship partly due to chinas growing influence and essentiality in the asia-pacific region specifying that its common interest with china is far greater than any differences furthermore singapore has positioned itself as a strong supporter for chinas constructive engagement and peaceful development in the region in addition china has been singapores largest trading partner since 2013 after surpassing malaysia singapore and the united states share a long-standing close relationship in particular in defence the economy health and education singapore has also pushed regional counter-terrorism initiatives with a strong resolve to deal with terrorists inside its borders to this end the country has step up co-operation with asean members and china to strengthen regional security and fight terrorism as well as participating in the organisations first joint maritime exercise with the latter it has also given support to the us-led coalition to fight terrorism with bilateral co-operation in counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation initiatives and joint military exercises


 military 

the singaporean military is arguably the most technologically advanced in southeast asia it comprises the singapore army republic of singapore navy and republic of singapore air force it is seen as the guarantor of the countrys independence this principle translates into the culture involving all citizens in the countrys defence the government spends 4.9% of the countrys gdp on the military—high by regional standards—and one out of every four dollars of government spending is spent on defenceafter its independence singapore had two infantry regiments commanded by british officers this force was considered too small to provide effective security for the new country so development of its military forces became a priority britain pulled its military out of singapore in october 1971 leaving behind only a small british australian and new zealand force as a token military presence the last british soldier left singapore in march 1976 new zealand troops were the last to leave in 1989

a great deal of initial support came from israel a country that is not recognised by the neighbouring muslim-majority nations of malaysia indonesia or brunei the main fear after independence was an invasion by malaysia israeli defense force idf commanders were tasked with creating the singapore armed forces saf from scratch and israeli instructors were brought in to train singaporean soldiers military courses were conducted according to the idfs format and singapore adopted a system of conscription and reserve service based on the israeli model singapore still maintains strong security ties with israel and is one of the biggest buyers of israeli arms and weapons systems the matador anti-tank weapon is one example of recent singaporean–israeli collaborationthe saf is being developed to respond to a wide range of issues in both conventional and unconventional warfare the defence science and technology agency is responsible for procuring resources for the military the geographic restrictions of singapore mean that the saf must plan to fully repulse an attack as they can not fall back and re-group the small size of the population has also affected the way the saf has been designed with a small active force but a large number of reservessingapore has conscription for all able-bodied males at age 18 except those with a criminal record or who can prove that their loss would bring hardship to their families males who have yet to complete pre-university education or are awarded the public service commission scholarship can opt to defer their draft though not required to perform military service the number of women in the saf has been increasing since 1989 they have been allowed to fill military vocations formerly reserved for men before induction into a specific branch of the armed forces recruits undergo at least 9 weeks of basic military training

because of the scarcity of open land on the main island training involving activities such as live firing and amphibious warfare is often carried out on smaller islands typically barred to civilian access this also avoids risk to the main island and the city however large-scale drills are considered too dangerous to be performed in the area and since 1975 have been performed in taiwan training is also held in about a dozen other countries in general military exercises are held with foreign forces once or twice per week

due to airspace and land constraints the republic of singapore air force rsaf maintains a number of overseas bases in australia the united states and france the rsafs 130 squadron is based in raaf base pearce western australia and its 126 squadron is based in the oakey army aviation centre queensland the rsaf has one squadron—the 150 squadron—based in cazaux air base in southern france the rsaf also has a few overseas detachments in the united states in san diego california marana arizona grand prairie texas and luke air force base among othersthe saf has sent forces to assist in operations outside the country in areas such as iraq and afghanistan in both military and civilian roles in the region it has helped stabilise east timor and has provided aid to aceh in indonesia following the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami in 2014 the rsn deployed two ships the rss resolute and the tenacious to the gulf of aden to aid in counter piracy efforts as part of task force 151 the saf also helped in relief efforts during hurricane katrina and typhoon haiyan singapore is part of the five power defence arrangements a military alliance with australia malaysia new zealand and the united kingdom

 nature 

singapores urbanisation means that it has lost 95% of its historical forests and now over half of the naturally occurring fauna and flora in singapore is present in nature reserves such as the bukit timah nature reserve and the sungei buloh wetland reserve which comprise only 0.25% of singapores land area to combat this decline in 1967 the government introduced the vision of making singapore a garden city aiming to soften the harshness of urbanisation and improve the quality of life since then nearly 10% of singapores land has been set aside for parks and nature reserves the government also has plans to preserve the remaining wildlifesingapores well known gardens include the singapore botanic gardens a 150-year-old tropical garden and singapores first unesco world heritage site and gardens by the bay a popular tourist attraction
