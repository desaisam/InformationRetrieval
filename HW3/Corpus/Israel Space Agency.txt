the israel space agency isa hebrew סוכנות החלל הישראלית‎  sochnut hachalal hayisraelit is a governmental body a part of israels ministry of science and technology that coordinates all israeli space research programs with scientific and commercial goals
the agency was founded by the theoretical physicist professor yuval neeman in 1983 to replace the national committee for space research which was established in 1960 to set up the infrastructure required for space missions the agency is currently headed by professor isaac ben israel as chairman and avi blasberger as director generaltoday israel is the smallest country with indigenous launch capabilities


 history 
the israel space agency has history dating back to the late 1950s


 ncsr and foreign reliance 

the israeli space agency originated as a university-based research project from tel aviv university in the early 1960s in 1960 the national committee for space research ncsr was formed by the israel academy of sciences and humanities the committee was formed to increase research activities across the academic communities in israel while at the time establishing a space program was not particularly one of its goals during the 60s through the late 70s the committee developed the infrastructure needed for research and development in space exploration and sciences one of the ncsrs earliest achievements took place in 1961 with the launch of its first two-stage rocketfollowing political tension with egypt and syria reconnaissance flights became evermore difficult in 1979 a satellite program was proposed followed by a year of feasibility study the study was completed by late 1980 saguy requested from prime minister menachem begin that the project proceed to its next phase in 1982 a new recommendation called ofeq program was submitted for developing an observation satellite the program included timelines planning for a ground station budget estimates and personnel requirements the primary goal was to develop a satellite program without relying on any foreign know-how to allow flexibility and creativity the launcher would be developed by malam the two engines by the israel military industries imi and the third by rafael


 establishment of a space agency 
at the end of 1982 it was decided during a closed-door meeting to establish an israeli space agency the decision was made by pm menachem begin defense minister ariel sharon and former director aharon beit halahmi the initial goal was to pursue the program to develop to ofeq and the shavit launchers in january 1983 the israeli government authorized the minister of science and technology prof yuval neeman to establish an israeli space agency with the goal of advancing israels space program unlike the ncsr which was primarily used for feasibility and infrastructure studies in july 1983 the isa was officially founded in tel aviv to coordinate the nations space program in affiliation to the ministry of science culture  sport and professor dror sadeh was nominated to be its director-general
in 1984 the national space knowledge center was established in cooperation with israel aircraft industries a contract was signed between iai and ministry of defence for the development of the needed infrastructure and of israels first observation satellite this came to fruition in 1988 when israel launched the first in a series of ofeq satellites and thus became one of only a few nations in the world possessing an indigenous space launching capability see timeline of first orbital launches by country the project management at israel aircraft industries was headed for many years by dr moshe bar-lev
