parker solar probe 2018-presenton apollos 8 and 10–17 each s-ivb upper stage jettisoned four sections of a truncated conical adapter that supported the apollo service module and except for apollo 8 enclosed the apollo lunar module these panels are in heliocentric orbit including those from apollos 13–17 whose s-ivbs impacted the moon as the s-ivbs jettisoned them before maneuvering themselves into lunar impact trajectories the panels continued on lunar flyby trajectories into heliocentric orbit the adapter panels on apollo 9 were jettisoned in earth orbit before the s-ivb burned into an earth escape trajectory they eventually decayed
