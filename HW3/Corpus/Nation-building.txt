nation-building is constructing or structuring a national identity using the power of the state it is thus narrower than what paul james calls nation formation the broad process through which nations come into being nation-building aims at the unification of the people within the state so that it remains politically stable and viable in the long run according to harris mylonas legitimate authority in modern national states is connected to popular rule to majorities nation-building is the process through which these majorities are constructednation builders are those members of a state who take the initiative to develop the national community through government programs including military conscription and national content mass schooling nation-building can involve the use of propaganda or major infrastructure development to foster social harmony and economic growth according to columbia university political scientist andreas wimmer three factors tend to determine the success of nation-building over the long-run the early development of civil-society organisations the rise of a state capable of providing public goods evenly across a territory and the emergence of a shared medium of communication


 overview 
in the modern era nation-building referred to the efforts of newly independent nations notably the nations of africa but also in the balkans to redefine the populace of territories that had been carved out by colonial powers or empires without regard to ethnic religious or other boundaries these reformed states would then become viable and coherent national entitiesnation-building includes the creation of national paraphernalia such as flags anthems national days national stadiums national airlines national languages and national myths at a deeper level national identity needed to be deliberately constructed by molding different ethnic groups into a nation especially since in many newly established states colonial practices of divide and rule had resulted in ethnically heterogeneous populationshowever many new states were plagued by tribalism that is rivalry between ethnic groups within the nation this sometimes resulted in their near-disintegration such as the attempt by biafra to secede from nigeria in 1970 or the continuing demand of the somali people in the ogaden region of ethiopia for complete independence in asia the division of british india into india and pakistan was in part due to ethnic differences which might have been aided by other factors like colonial mismanagement of the situation the rwandan genocide as well as the recurrent problems experienced by the sudan can also be related to a lack of ethnic religious or racial cohesion within the nation it has often proved difficult to unite states with similar ethnic but different colonial backgrounds whereas some consider cameroon to be an example of success fractures are emerging in the form of the anglophone problem failures like senegambia confederation demonstrate the problems of uniting francophone and anglophone territories


 terminology nation-building versus state-building 
traditionally there has been some confusion between the use of the term nation-building and that of state-building the terms are sometimes used interchangeably in north america both have fairly narrow and different definitions in political science the former referring to national identity the latter to infrastructure and the institutions of the state the debate has been clouded further by the existence of two very different schools of thought on state-building the first prevalent in the media portrays state-building as an interventionist action by foreign countries the second more academic in origin and increasingly accepted by international institutions sees state-building as an indigenous process  for a discussion of the definitional issues see state-building carolyn stephensons essay and the papers by whaites cpcipa or odi cited below
the confusion over terminology has meant that more recently nation-building has come to be used in a completely different context with reference to what has been succinctly described by its proponents as the use of armed force in the aftermath of a conflict to underpin an enduring transition to democracy in this sense nation-building better referred to as state-building describes deliberate efforts by a foreign power to construct or install the institutions of a national government according to a model that may be more familiar to the foreign power but is often considered foreign and even destabilizing  in this sense state-building is typically characterized by massive investment military occupation transitional government and the use of propaganda to communicate governmental policy
