the following is a list of numbered minor planets in numerical order minor planets are all small bodies in the solar system including dwarf planets with the exception of comets the catalog consists of hundreds of pages each containing 1000 minor planets every year tens of thousands of newly numbered minor planets are published in the minor planet circular by the minor planet center on behalf of the international astronomical union see index as of  february 2019 there are 523,824 numbered minor planets secured discoveries out of a total of 789,069 observed bodies with the remainder being unnumbered minor planetsthe catalogs first object is 1 ceres discovered by giuseppe piazzi on january 1 1801 while its best-known entry is pluto listed as 134340 pluto the vast majority 97 of minor planets are asteroids from the asteroid belt the catalog uses a color code to indicate a bodys dynamical classification there are more than a thousand different minor-planet discoverers observing from a growing list of registered observatories in terms of numbers the most prolific discoverers are linear spacewatch mls neat and css there are also 21,348 named minor planets mostly after people places and figures from mythology and fiction approximately 96% of all numbered catalog entries remain unnamed 3708 1974 fv1 and 516560 annapolisroyal are currently the lowest-numbered unnamed and highest-numbered named minor planets respectivelyit is expected that the upcoming survey by the lsst will discover another 5 million minor planets during the next ten years—a tenfold increase from current numbers while all asteroids with a diameter above 10 kilometers have already been discovered there might be as many as 10 trillion 1-meter-sized asteroids or larger out to the orbit of jupiter and more than a trillion minor planets in the kuiper belt of which hundreds are likely dwarf planets for minor planets grouped by a particular aspect or property see § specific lists


 description of partial lists 
the list of minor planets consists of more than 500 partial lists each containing 1000 minor planets grouped into 10 tables the data is sourced from the minor planet center mpc and expanded with data from the jpl sbdb mean-diameter johnstons archive sub-classification and others see detailed field descriptions below for an overview of all existing partial lists see § main index
the information given for a minor planet includes a permanent and provisional designation § designation a citation that links to the meanings of minor planet names only if named the discovery date location and credited discoverers § discovery and § discoverers a category with a more refined classification than the principal grouping represented by the background color § category a mean-diameter ⌀ sourced from jpls sbdb or otherwise calculated estimates in italics § diameter and a reference ref to the corresponding pages at mpc and jpl sbdb 
the mpc may credit one or several astronomers a survey or similar program or even the observatory site with the discovery in the first column of the table an existing stand-alone article is linked in boldface while self-redirects are never linked discoverers discovery site and category are only linked if they differ from the preceding catalog entry


 example 

the example above shows five catalog entries from one of the partial lists all five asteroids were discovered at palomar observatory by the palomar–leiden survey pls the mpc directly credits the surveys principle investigators that is the astronomers cornelis van houten ingrid van houten-groeneveld and tom gehrels this is the only instance where the list of minor planets diverges from the discovery circumstances in the official mpc list 189004 capys discovered on 16 october 1977 is the only named minor planet its background color indicates that it is a jupiter trojan from the trojan camp at jupiters l5 estimated to be approximately 12 kilometers in diameter all other objects are smaller asteroids from the inner white central light-grey and outer regions dark grey of the asteroid belt the provisional designation for all objects is an uncommon survey designation


 designation 
after discovery minor planets generally receive a provisional designation eg 1989 ac then a leading sequential number in parenthesis eg 4179 1989 ac turning it into a permanent designation numbered minor planet optionally a name can be given replacing the provisional part of the designation eg 4179 toutatis on wikipedia named minor planets also drop their parenthesis
in modern times a minor planet receives a sequential number only after it has been observed several times over at least 4 oppositions minor planets whose orbits are not yet precisely known are known by their provisional designation this rule was not necessarily followed in earlier times and some bodies received a number but subsequently became lost minor planets the 2000 recovery of 719 albert which had been lost for nearly 89 years eliminated the last numbered lost asteroid only after a number is assigned is the minor planet eligible to receive a name usually the discoverer has up to 10 years to pick a name many minor planets now remain unnamed especially towards the end of the twentieth century large-scale automated asteroid discovery programs such as linear have increased the pace of discoveries so much that the vast majority of minor planets will most likely never receive names
for these reasons the sequence of numbers only approximately matches the timeline of discovery in extreme cases such as lost minor planets there may be a considerable mismatch for instance the high-numbered 69230 hermes was originally discovered in 1937 but it was a lost until 2003 only after it was rediscovered could its orbit be established and a number assigned


 discoverers 

the mpc credits more than 1000 professional and amateur astronomers as discoverers of minor planets many of them have discovered only a few minor planets or even just co-discovered a single one moreover a discoverer does not need to be a human being there are about 300 programs surveys and observatories credited as discoverers among these a small group of us programs and surveys actually account for most of all discoveries made so far see pie chart as the total of numbered minor planets is growing by the tens of thousands every year all statistical figures are constantly changing in contrast to the top 10 discoverers displayed in this articles the mpc summarizes the total of discoveries somewhat differently that is by a distinct group of discoverers for example bodies discovered in the palomar–leiden survey are directly credited to the programs principal investigators


 discovery site 

observatories telescopes and surveys that report astrometric observations of small solar system bodies to the mpc receive a numeric or alphanumeric code such as 675 for the palomar observatory or i41 for the palomar transient factory a dedicated survey that was conducted at palomar observatory during 2009–2012 on numbering such an observatory may directly be credited by the mpc as discoverer


 category 

in this catalog minor planets are classified into one of 8 principal orbital groups and highlighted with a distinct color these are

the vast majority of minor planets are evenly distributed between the inner- central and outer parts of the asteroid belt which are separated by the two kirkwood gaps at 2.5 and 2.82 au nearly 97.5% of all minor planets are main-belt asteroids mba while jupiter trojans mars-crossing and near-earth asteroids each account for less than 1% of the overall population only a small number of distant minor planets that is the centaurs and trans-neptunian objects have been numbered so far in the partial lists table column category further refines this principal grouping

main-belt asteroids show their family membership based on the synthetic hierarchical clustering method by nesvorný 2014
resonant asteroids are displayed by their numerical ratio and include the hildas 32 cybeles 74 thules 43 and griquas 21 while the jupiter trojans 11 display whether they belong to the greek l4 or trojan camp l5
near-earth objects are divided into the aten ate amor amo apollo apo and atira ati group with some of them being potentially hazardous asteroids pha
trans-neptunian objects are divided into dynamical subgroups including cubewanos hot or cold scattered disc objects plutinos and other neptunian resonances
comet-like andor retrograde damocloids with low tjupiter are tagged with damocloid
other unusual objects based on mpcs and johnstons lists are labelled unusual
binary and trinary minor planets with companions are tagged with moon and link to their corresponding entry in minor-planet moon and
objects with an exceptionally long or short rotation period are tagged with slow period of 100 hours or fast period of less than 2.2 hours and link to their corresponding entry in list of slow rotators and list of fast rotators respectively

 diameter 
if available a minor planets mean diameter ⌀ in meters m or kilometers km is taken from the small-body database these figures were typically published by the neowise mission of nasas wide-field infrared survey explorer mean diameters are rounded to two significant figures if smaller than 100 kilometers estimates are in italics and calculated from a magnitude-to-diameter conversion using an assumed albedo derived from the bodys orbital parameters or if available from a family-specific mean albedo also see asteroid family table
