 term 


 origins 
when first proposed neocolonialism labeled european countries continued economic and cultural relationships with their former colonies african countries that had been liberated in the aftermath of second world war kwame nkrumah former president of ghana 1960–66 coined the term which appeared in the 1963 preamble of the organization of african unity charter and was the title of his 1965 book neo-colonialism the last stage of imperialism 1965 nkrumah theoretically developed and extended to the post–war 20th century the socio-economic and political arguments presented by lenin in the pamphlet imperialism the highest stage of capitalism 1917 the pamphlet frames 19th-century imperialism as the logical extension of geopolitical power to meet the financial investment needs of the political economy of capitalism in neo-colonialism the last stage of imperialism kwame nkrumah wrotein place of colonialism as the main instrument of imperialism we have today neo-colonialism    which like colonialism is an attempt to export the social conflicts of the capitalist countries   the result of neo-colonialism is that foreign capital is used for the exploitation rather than for the development of the less developed parts of the world investment under neo-colonialism increases rather than decreases the gap between the rich and the poor countries of the world the struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries it is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed


 non-aligned world 
neocolonialism was used to describe a type of foreign intervention in countries belonging to the pan-africanist movement as well as the bandung conference asian–african conference 1955 which led to the non-aligned movement 1961 neocolonialism was formally defined by the all-african peoples conference aapc and published in the resolution on neo-colonialism at both the tunis conference 1960 and the cairo conference 1961 aapc described the actions of the french community of independent states organized by france as neocolonialthroughout the decades of the cold war the countries of the non-aligned movement and the organization of solidarity with the people of asia africa and latin america defined neocolonialism as the primary collective enemy of the economies and cultures of their respective countries moreover neocolonialism was integrated into the national liberation ideologies of marxist guerrilla armies during the 1970s in the portuguese african colonies of mozambique and angola upon assuming government power the liberation front of mozambique frelimo frente de libertação de moçambique and the peoples movement for the liberation of angola — labour party mpla movimento popular de libertação de angola — partido do trabalho respectively established policies to counter neocolonial agreements with the former colonist country


 françafrique 
the representative example of european neocolonialism is françafrique the french africa constituted by the continued close relationships between france and its former african colonies in 1955 the initial usage of the french africa term by president félix houphouët-boigny of ivory coast denoted positive social cultural and economic franco–african relations it was later applied by neocolonialism critics to describe an imbalanced international relation the politician jacques foccart the principal advisor for african matters to french presidents charles de gaulle 1958–69 and georges pompidou 1969–1974 was the principal proponent of françafrique the works of verschave and beti reported a forty-year post-independence relationship with frances former colonial peoples which featured colonial garrisons in situ and monopolies by french multinational corporations usually for the exploitation of mineral resources it was argued that the african leaders with close ties to france — especially during the soviet–american cold war 1945–91 — acted more as agents of french business and geopolitical interests than as the national leaders of sovereign states cited examples are omar bongo gabon félix houphouët-boigny ivory coast gnassingbé eyadéma togo denis sassou-nguesso republic of the congo idriss déby chad and hamani diori niger

 neocolonial economic dominance 

in 1961 regarding the economic mechanism of  neocolonial control in the speech cuba historical exception or vanguard in the anti-colonial struggle argentine revolutionary ché guevara said

we politely referred to as underdeveloped in truth are colonial semi-colonial or dependent countries we are countries whose economies have been distorted by imperialism which has abnormally developed those branches of industry or agriculture needed to complement its complex economy underdevelopment or distorted development brings a dangerous specialization in raw materials inherent in which is the threat of hunger for all our peoples we the underdeveloped are also those with the single crop the single product the single market a single product whose uncertain sale depends on a single market imposing and fixing conditions that is the great formula for imperialist economic domination


 dependency theory 

dependency theory is the theoretical description of economic neocolonialism it proposes that the global economic system comprises wealthy countries at the center and poor countries at the periphery economic neocolonialism extracts the human and natural resources of a poor country to flow to the economies of the wealthy countries it claims that the poverty of the peripheral countries is the result of how they are integrated in the global economic system dependency theory derives from the marxist analysis of economic inequalities within the worlds system of economies thus under-development of the periphery is a direct result of development in the center it includes the concept of the late 19th century semi-colony it contrasts the marxist perspective of the theory of colonial dependency with capitalist economics the latter proposes that poverty is a development stage in the poor countrys progress towards full integration in the global economic system proponents of dependency theory such as venezuelan historian federico brito figueroa who investigated the socioeconomic bases of neocolonial dependency influenced the thinking of the former president of venezuela hugo chávez

in the 1960s under the leadership of chairman mehdi ben barka the cuban tricontinental conference organization of solidarity with the people of asia africa and latin america recognised and supported the validity of revolutionary anti-colonialism as a means for colonised peoples of the third world to achieve self-determination which policy angered the us and france moreover chairman barka headed the commission on neocolonialism which dealt with the work to resolve the neocolonial involvement of colonial powers in decolonised counties and said that the us as the leading capitalist country of the world was in practise the principal neocolonialist political actor


 multinational corporations 

critics of neocolonialism also argue that investment by multinational corporations enriches few in underdeveloped countries and causes humanitarian environmental and ecological damage to their populations they argue that this results in unsustainable development and perpetual underdevelopment these countries remain reservoirs of cheap labor and raw materials while restricting access to advanced production techniques to develop their own economies in some countries monopolization of natural resources while initially leading to an influx of investment is often followed by increases in unemployment poverty and a decline in per-capita incomein the west african nations of guinea-bissau senegal and mauritania fishing was historically central to the economy beginning in 1979 the european union began negotiating contracts with governments for fisheries off the coast of west africa commercial unsustainable over-fishing by foreign fleets played a significant role in large-scale unemployment and migration of people across the region this violates the united nations convention on the law of the seas which recognizes the importance of fishing to local communities and insists that government fishing agreements with foreign companies should target only surplus stocks


 international borrowing 

to alleviate the effects of neocolonialism american economist jeffrey sachs recommended that the entire african debt ca 200 billion us dollars be dismissed and recommended that african nations not repay the world bank and the international monetary fund imf
