the historical phenomenon of colonization is one that stretches around the globe and across time  modern state global colonialism or imperialism began in the 15th century with the age of discovery led by portuguese and then by the spanish exploration of the americas the coasts of africa the middle east india and east asia the  
portuguese and spanish empires were the first global empires because they were the first to stretch across different continents covering vast territories around the globe in 1492 notable genoese italian explorer christopher columbus and his castilian spanish crew discovered the americas for the crown of castile the phrase the empire on which the sun never sets was first used for the spanish empire in the 16th century during the late 16th and 17th centuries england france and the dutch republic also established their own overseas empires in direct competition with each other 
the end of the 18th and early 19th century saw the first era of decolonization when most of the european colonies in the americas gained their independence from their respective metropoles spain was irreversibly weakened after the loss of their new world colonies but the kingdom of great britain uniting scotland with england and wales france portugal and the dutch turned their attention to the old world particularly south africa india and south east asia where coastal enclaves had already been established 
the second industrial revolution in the 19th century led to what has been termed the era of new imperialism when the pace of colonization rapidly accelerated the height of which was the scramble for africa in which belgium germany and italy were also participants
there were conflicts between colonizing states and revolutions from colonized areas shaping areas of control and establishing independent nations during the 20th century the colonies of the defeated central powers in world war i were distributed amongst the victors as mandates but it was not until the end of world war ii that the second phase of decolonization began in earnest


 periodisation 

some commentators identify three waves of european colonialismthe three main countries in the first wave of european colonialism were the early ottoman empire spain and portugal the portuguese started the long age of european colonisation with the conquest of ceutamorocco in 1415 and the conquest and discovery of other african territories and islands this would also start the movement known as the age of discoveries the ottomans conquered south eastern europe the middle east and much of northern and eastern africa between 1359 and 1653 the spanish and portuguese launched the colonisation of the americas basing their territorial claims on the treaty of tordesillas of 1494 this treaty demarcated the respective spheres of influence of spain and portugal the expansion achieved by spain and portugal caught the attention of britain france and the netherlands the entrance of these three powers into the caribbean and north america perpetuated european colonialism in these regionsthe second wave of european colonialism commenced with britains involvement in asia in support of the british east india company other countries such as france portugal and the netherlands also had involvement in european expansion in asiathe third wave new imperialism consisted of the scramble for africa regulated by the terms of the berlin conference of 1884–1885 the conference effectively divided africa among the european powers vast regions of africa came under the sway of britain france germany portugal belgium italy and spain – which gives insight to africas post-colonial diversitygilmartin explains these three waves of colonialism have been linked to capitalism the first wave of european expansion involved exploring the world to find new revenue and perpetuating european feudalism the second wave focused on developing the mercantile capitalism system and the manufacturing industry in europe the last wave of european colonialism solidified all capitalistic endeavours by providing new markets and raw materials


 portuguese and spanish exploration and colonization 

european colonization of both eastern and western hemispheres has its roots in portuguese exploration there were financial and religious motives behind this exploration by finding the source of the lucrative spice trade the portuguese could reap its profits for themselves they would also be able to probe the existence of the fabled christian kingdom of prester john with an eye to encircling the islamic ottoman empire itself gaining territories and colonies in eastern europe the first foothold outside of europe was gained with the conquest of ceuta in 1415 during the 15th century portuguese sailors discovered the atlantic islands of madeira azores and cape verde which were duly populated and pressed progressively further along the west african coast until bartolomeu dias demonstrated it was possible to sail around africa by rounding the cape of good hope in 1488 paving the way for vasco da gama to reach india in 1498
portuguese successes led to spanish financing of a mission by christopher columbus in 1492 to explore an alternative route to asia by sailing west when columbus eventually made landfall in the caribbean antilles he believed he had reached the coast of india and that the people he encountered there were indians with red skin this is why native americans have been called indians or red-indians in truth columbus had arrived on a continent that was new to the europeans the americas
after columbus first trips competing spanish and portuguese claims to new territories and sea routes were solved with the treaty of tordesillas in 1494 which divided the world outside of europe in two areas of trade an exploration between the iberian kingdoms of castile and portugal along a north-south meridian 370 leagues west of cape verde according to this international agreement the larger part of the americas and the pacific ocean were open to spanish exploration and colonization while africa the indian ocean and most of asia were assigned to portugal
the boundaries specified by the treaty of tordesillas were put to the test in 1521 when ferdinand magellan and his spanish sailors among other europeans sailing for the spanish crown became the first european to cross the pacific ocean reaching guam and the philippines parts of which the portuguese had already explored sailing from the indian ocean the two by now global empires which had set out from opposing directions had finally met on the other side of the world the conflicts that arose between both powers were finally solved with the treaty of zaragoza in 1529 which defined the areas of spanish and portuguese influence in asia establishing the anti meridian or line of demarcation on the other side of the world
during the 16th century the portuguese continued to press both eastwards and westwards into the oceans towards asia they made the first direct contact between europeans and the peoples inhabiting present day countries such as mozambique madagascar sri lanka malaysia indonesia east timor 1512 china and finally japan in the opposite direction the portuguese colonized the huge territory that eventually became brasil and the spanish conquistadores established the vast viceroyalties of new spain and peru and later of río de la plata argentina and new granada colombia in asia the portuguese encountered ancient and well populated societies and established a seaborne empire consisting of armed coastal trading posts along their trade routes such as goa malacca and macau so they had relatively little cultural impact on the societies they engaged in the western hemisphere the european colonization involved the emigration of large numbers of settlers soldiers and administrators intent on owning land and exploiting the apparently primitive as perceived by old world standards indigenous peoples of the americas the result was that the colonization of the new world was catastrophic native peoples were no match for european technology ruthlessness or their diseases which decimated the indigenous population
spanish treatment of the indigenous populations caused a fierce debate the valladolid controversy over whether indians possessed souls and if so whether they were entitled to the basic rights of mankind bartolomé de las casas author of a short account of the destruction of the indies championed the cause of the native peoples and was opposed by sepúlveda who claimed amerindians were natural slaves
the roman catholic church played a large role in spanish and portuguese overseas activities the dominicans jesuits and franciscans notably francis xavier in asia and junípero serra in north america were particularly active in this endeavour many buildings erected by the jesuits still stand such as the cathedral of saint paul in macau and the santisima trinidad de paraná in paraguay the latter an example of the jesuit reductions the dominican and franciscan buildings of californias missions and new mexicos missions stand restored such as mission santa barbara in santa barbara california and san francisco de asis mission church in ranchos de taos new mexico

as characteristically happens in any colonialism european or not previous or subsequent both spain and portugal profited handsomely from their newfound overseas colonies the spanish from gold and silver from mines such as potosí and zacateca in new spain the portuguese from the huge markups they enjoyed as trade intermediaries particarlarly during the namban japan trade period the influx of precious metals to the spanish monarchys coffers allowed it to finance costly religious wars in europe which ultimately proved its economic undoing the supply of metals was not infinite and the large inflow caused inflation and debt and subsequently affected the rest of europe


 northern european challenges to the iberian hegemony 
it was not long before the exclusivity of iberian claims to the americas was challenged by other up and coming european powers primarily the netherlands france and england the view taken by the rulers of these nations is epitomized by the quotation attributed to francis i of france demanding to be shown the clause in adams will excluding his authority from the new world
this challenge initially took the form of piratical attacks such as those by francis drake on spanish treasure fleets or coastal settlements but later the northern european countries began establishing settlements of their own primarily in areas that were outside of spanish interests such as what is now the eastern seaboard of the united states and canada or islands in the caribbean such as aruba martinique and barbados that had been abandoned by the spanish in favour of the mainland and larger islands
whereas spanish colonialism was based on the religious conversion and exploitation of local populations via encomiendas many spaniards emigrated to the americas to elevate their social status and were not interested in manual labour northern european colonialism was bolstered by those emigrating for religious reasons for example the mayflower voyage the motive for emigration was not to become an aristocrat or to spread ones faith but to start a new society afresh structured according to the colonists wishes the most populous emigration of the 17th century was that of the english who after a series of wars with the dutch and french came to dominate the thirteen colonies on the eastern coast of the present day united states and other colonies such as newfoundland and ruperts land in what is now canada
however the english french and dutch were no more averse to making a profit than the spanish and portuguese and whilst their areas of settlement in the americas proved to be devoid of the precious metals found by the spanish trade in other commodities and products that could be sold at massive profit in europe provided another reason for crossing the atlantic in particular furs from canada tobacco and cotton grown in virginia and sugar in the islands of the caribbean and brazil due to the massive depletion of indigenous labour plantation owners had to look elsewhere for manpower for these labour-intensive crops they turned to the centuries-old slave trade of west africa and began transporting africans across the atlantic on a massive scale – historians estimate that the atlantic slave trade brought between 10 and 12 million african mostly black skinned slaves to the new world the islands of the caribbean soon came to be populated by slaves of african descent ruled over by a white minority of plantation owners interested in making a fortune and then returning to their home country to spend it


 role of companies in early colonialism 
from its very outset western colonialism was operated as a joint public-private venture columbus voyages to the americas were partially funded by italian investors but whereas the spanish state maintained a tight rein on trade with its colonies by law the colonies could only trade with one designated port in the mother country and treasure was brought back in special convoys the english french and dutch granted what were effectively trade monopolies to joint-stock companies such as the east india companies and the hudsons bay company imperial russia had no state sponsored expeditions or colonization in the americas but did charter the first russian joint-stock commercial enterprise the russian america company which did sponsor those activities in its territories


 european colonies in india 

in may 1498 the portuguese set foot in kozhikode in kerala making them the first europeans to sail to india rivalry among reigning european powers saw the entry of the dutch english french danish and others the kingdoms of india were gradually taken over by the europeans and indirectly controlled by puppet rulers in 1600 queen elizabeth i accorded a charter forming the east india company to trade with india and eastern asia the english landed in india in surat in 1612 by the 19th century they had assumed direct and indirect control over most of india


 independence in the americas 1770–1820 

during the five decades following 1770 britain france spain and portugal lost many of their possessions in the americas


 britain and the thirteen colonies 

after the conclusion of the seven years war in 1763 britain had emerged as the worlds dominant power but found itself mired in debt and struggling to finance the navy and army necessary to maintain a global empire the british parliaments attempt to raise taxes from north american colonists raised fears among the americans that their rights as englishmen and particularly their rights of self-government were in danger
from 1765 a series of disputes with parliament over taxation led to the american revolution first to informal committees of correspondence among the colonies then to coordinated protest and resistance with an important event in 1770 the boston massacre a standing army was formed by the united colonies and independence was declared  by the second continental congress on 4 july 1776
the patriots fought the british in the american revolutionary war 1775–1783 formal acts of rebellion against british authority began in 1774 when the patriot suffolk resolves effectively abolished the legal government of the province of massachusetts bay and expelled all royal officials the tensions caused by this would lead to the outbreak of fighting between patriot militia and british regulars at lexington and concord in april 1775
the american war of independence continued until 1783 when the treaty of paris was signed britain recognised the sovereignty of the united states over the territory bounded by the british possessions to the north florida to the south and the mississippi river to the west


 france and the haitian revolution 1791–1804 
the haitian revolution a slave revolt led by toussaint louverture in the french colony of saint-domingue established haïti as a free black republic the first of its kind haiti became the second independent nation that was a former european colony in the western hemisphere after the united states africans and people of african ancestry freed themselves from slavery and colonization by taking advantage of the conflict among whites over how to implement the reforms of the french revolution in this slave society although independence was declared in 1804 it was not until 1825 that it was formally recognized by king charles x of france


 spain and the wars of independence in latin america 

the gradual decline of spain as an imperial power throughout the 17th century was hastened by the war of the spanish succession 1701–14 as a result of which it lost its european imperial possessions the death knell for the spanish empire in the americas was napoleons invasion of the iberian peninsula in 1808 with the installation of his brother joseph on the spanish throne the main tie between the metropole and its colonies in the americas the spanish monarchy had been cut leading the colonists to question their continued subordination to a declining and distant country
with an eye on the events of the american revolution forty years earlier revolutionary leaders began bloody wars of independence against spain whose armies were ultimately unable to maintain control by 1831 spain had been ejected from the mainland of the americas leaving a collection of independent republics that stretched from chile and argentina in the south to mexico in the north spains colonial possessions were reduced to cuba puerto rico the philippines and a number of small islands in the pacific all of which she was to lose to the united states in the 1898 spanish–american war or sell to germany shortly thereafter


 portugal and brazil 
brazil was the only country in latin america to gain its independence without bloodshed the invasion of portugal by napoleon in 1808 had forced king joão vi to escape to brazil and establish his court in rio de janeiro for thirteen years portugal was ruled from brazil the only instance of such a reversal of roles between colony and metropole until his return to portugal in 1821 his son dom pedro was left in charge of brazil and in 1822 he declared independence from portugal and himself the emperor of brazil unlike spains former colonies which had abandoned the monarchy in favour of republicanism brazil therefore retained its links with its monarchy the house of braganza


 india 1858 onwards 

vasco da gamas maritime success to discover for europeans a new sea route to india in 1498 paved the way for direct indo-european commerce the portuguese soon set up trading-posts in goa daman diu and bombay the next to arrive were the dutch the english—who set up a trading-post in the west-coast port of surat in 1619—and the french the internal conflicts among indian kingdoms gave opportunities to the european traders to gradually establish political influence and appropriate lands although these continental european powers were to control various regions of southern and eastern india during the ensuing century they would eventually lose all their territories in india to the british with the exception of the french outposts of pondicherry and chandernagore the dutch port in travancore and the portuguese colonies of goa daman and diu


 the british in india 

the english east india company had been given permission by the mughal emperor jahangir in 1617 to trade in india gradually the companys increasing influence led the de jure mughal emperor farrukh siyar to grant them dastaks or permits for duty-free trade in bengal in 1717 the nawab of bengal siraj ud daulah the de facto ruler of the bengal province opposed british attempts to use these permits this led to the battle of plassey in 1757 in which the armies of the east india company led by robert clive defeated the nawabs forces this was the first political foothold with territorial implications that the british had acquired in india clive was appointed by the company as its first governor of bengal in 1757 this was combined with british victories over the french at madras wandiwash and pondicherry that along with wider british successes during the seven years war reduced french influence in india after the battle of buxar in 1764 the company acquired the civil rights of administration in bengal from the mughal emperor shah alam ii it marked the beginning of its formal rule which was to engulf eventually most of india and extinguish the moghul rule and dynasty itself in less than a century
the east india company monopolized the trade of bengal they introduced a land taxation system called the permanent settlement which introduced a feudal-like structurea see zamindar in bengal by the 1850s the east india company controlled most of the indian sub-continent which included present-day pakistan and bangladesh their policy was sometimes summed up as divide and rule taking advantage of the enmity festering between various princely states and social and religious groups
the first major movement against the british companys high handed rule resulted in the indian rebellion of 1857 also known as the indian mutiny or sepoy mutiny or the first war of independence after a year of turmoil and reinforcement of the east india companys troops with british soldiers the company overcame the rebellion the nominal leader of the uprising the last mughal emperor bahadur shah zafar was exiled to burma his children were beheaded and the moghul line abolished in the aftermath all power was transferred from the east india company to the british crown which began to administer most of india as a colony the companys lands were controlled directly and the rest through the rulers of what it called the princely states there were 565 princely states when the indian subcontinent gained independence from britain in august 1947during period of the british raj famines in india often attributed to failed government policies were some of the worst ever recorded including the great famine of 1876–78 in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million people died and the indian famine of 1899–1900 in which 1.25 to 10 million people died the third plague pandemic started in china in the middle of the 19th century spreading plague to all inhabited continents and killing 10 million people in india alone despite persistent diseases and famines however the population of the indian subcontinent which stood at about 125 million in 1750 had reached 389 million by 1941indian economist utsa patnaik who has done a deep research on the fiscal relations between colonial india and britain calculated in her essay published in columbia university press that britain drained a total of £9.2 trillion equal to 45 trillion from india during the period 1765 to 1938


 other european empires in india 

like the other european colonists the french began their colonisation via commercial activities starting with the establishment of a factory in surat in 1668 the french started to settle down in india in 1673 beginning with the purchase of land at chandernagore from the mughal governor of bengal followed by the acquisition of pondicherry from the sultan of bijapur the next year both became the centres of the maritime commercial activities that the french conducted in india the french also had trading posts in mahe karikal and yanaom similar to the situation in tahiti and martinique the french colonial administrative area was insular but in india the french authority was isolated on the peripheries of a british-dominated territoryby the early eighteenth century the french had become the chief european rivals of the british during the eighteenth century it was highly possible for the indian subcontinent to have succumbed to french control but the defeat inflicted on them in the seven years war 1756–1763 permanently curtailed french ambitions the treaty of paris of 1763 restored the original five  to the french while making it clear that france could not expand its control beyond these areasthe beginning of the portuguese occupation of india can be traced back to the arrival of vasco da gama near calicut on 20 may 1498 soon after this other explorers traders and missionaries followed by 1515 the portuguese were the strongest naval power in the indian ocean and the malabar coast was dominated by them


 new imperialism 1870–1914 

the policy and ideology of european colonial expansion between the 1870s circa opening of suez canal and second industrial revolution and the outbreak of world war i in 1914 are often characterised as the new imperialism the period is distinguished by an unprecedented pursuit of what has been termed empire for empires sake aggressive competition for overseas territorial acquisitions and the emergence in colonising countries of doctrines of racial superiority which denied the fitness of subjugated peoples for self-governmentduring this period europes powers added nearly 8,880,000 square miles 23,000,000 km² to their overseas colonial possessions as it was mostly unoccupied by the western powers as late as the 1880s africa became the primary target of the new imperialist expansion known as the scramble for africa although conquest took place also in other areas — notably south-east asia and the east asian seaboard where japan joined the european powers scramble for territorythe berlin conference 1884–1885 mediated the imperial competition among britain france and germany defining effective occupation as the criterion for international recognition of colonial claims and codifying the imposition of direct rule accomplished usually through armed force
in germany rising pan-germanism was coupled to imperialism in the alldeutsche verband pangermanic league which argued that britains world power position gave the british unfair advantages on international markets thus limiting germanys economic growth and threatening its security
asking whether colonies paid economic historian grover clark argues an emphatic no  he reports that in every case the support cost especially the military system necessary to support and defend the colonies outran the total trade they produced  apart from the british empire they were not favored destinations for the immigration of surplus populations


 the scramble for africa 

africa was the target of the third wave of european colonialism after that of the americas and asia many european statesmen and industrialists wanted to accelerate the scramble for africa securing colonies before they strictly needed them as a champion of realpolitik bismarck disliked colonies and thought they were a waste of time but his hand was forced by pressure from both the elites and the general population which considered the colonization a necessity for german prestige german colonies in togoland samoa south-west africa and new guinea had corporate commercial roots while the equivalent german-dominated areas in east africa and china owed more to political motives the british also took an interest in africa using the east africa company to take over what are now kenya and uganda the british crown formally took over in 1895 and renamed the area the east africa protectorate
leopold ii of belgium personally owned the congo free state from 1885 to 1908 when round after round of international scandal regarding the abusive treatment of native workers forced the belgium government to take full ownership and responsibility the dutch empire continued to hold the dutch east indies which was one of the few profitable overseas colonies
in the same manner italy tried to conquer its place in the sun acquiring somaliland in 1899–90 eritrea and 1899 and taking advantage of the sick man of europe the ottoman empire also conquered tripolitania and cyrenaica modern libya with the 1911 treaty of lausanne the conquest of ethiopia which had remained the last african independent territory had to wait till the second italo-abyssinian war in 1935–36 the first italo-ethiopian war in 1895–96 had ended in defeat for italy
the portuguese and spanish colonial empire were smaller mostly legacies of past colonization most of their colonies had acquired independence during the latin american revolutions at the beginning of the 19th century


 imperialism in asia 

in asia the great game which lasted from 1813 to 1907 opposed the british empire against imperial russia for supremacy in central asia china was opened to western influence starting with the first and second opium wars 1839–1842 1856–1860 after the visits of commodore matthew perry in 1852–1854 japan opened itself to the western world during the meiji era 1868–1912
imperialism also took place in burma indonesia netherlands east indies malaya and the philippines burma had been under british rule for nearly a hundred years however it was always considered an “imperial backwater” this accounts for the fact that burma does not have an obvious colonial legacy and is not a part of the commonwealth in the beginning in the mid-1820s burma was administered from penang in britain’s straits settlements however it was soon brought within british india of which it remained a part until 1937 burma was governed as a province of india not considered very important and barely any accommodation was made to burmese political culture or sensitivities as reforms began to move india towards independence burma was simply dragged along


 inter-war period 1918–1939 

the colonial map was redrawn following the defeat of the german empire and the ottoman empire after the first world war 1914–18 colonies from the defeated empires were transferred to the newly founded league of nations which itself redistributed it to the victorious powers as mandates
the secret 1916 sykes-picot agreement partitioned the middle east between britain and france french mandates included syria and lebanon whilst the british were granted iraq and palestine the bulk of the arabian peninsula became the independent kingdom of saudi arabia in 1922 the discovery of the worlds largest easily accessible crude oil deposits led to an influx of western oil companies that dominated the regions economies until the 1970s and making the emirs of the oil states immensely rich enabling them to consolidate their hold on power and giving them a stake in preserving western hegemony over the region
during the 1920 and 1930s iraq syria and egypt moved towards independence although the british and french did not formally depart the region until they were forced to do so after world war ii


 japanese imperialism 

for japan the second half of the nineteenth century was a period of internal turmoil succeeded by a period of rapid development after being closed for centuries to western influence japan opened itself to the west during the meiji era 1868–1912 characterized by swift modernization and borrowings from european culture in law science etc this in turn helped make japan the modern power that it is now which was symbolized as soon as the 1904–1905 russo-japanese war this war marked the first victory of an asian power against a european imperial power and led to widespread fears among european populations first appearance of the yellow peril during the first part of the 20th century while china was still subject to various european imperialisms japan became an imperialist power conquering what it called a greater east asia co-prosperity sphere
with the final revision of treaties in 1894 japan may be considered to have joined the family of nations on a basis of equality with the western states from this same time imperialism became a dominant motive in japanese policy
japan ruled over and governed korea and taiwan from 1895 when the treaty of shimonoseki was concluded to 1945 when japan was defeated in 1910 korea was formally annexed to the japanese empire according to the korean the japanese colonization of korea was particularly brutal even by 20th-century standards this brutal colonization included the use of korean comfort women who were forced to serve as sex slaves in japanese army brothelsin 1931 japanese army units based in manchuria seized control of the region full-scale war with china followed in 1937 drawing japan toward an overambitious bid for asian hegemony greater east asia co-prosperity sphere which ultimately led to defeat and the loss of all its overseas territories after world war ii see japanese expansionism and japanese nationalism as in korea the japanese treatment of the chinese people was particularly brutal as exemplified by the nanjing massacre


 second decolonization 1945–99 

anticolonialist movements had begun to gain momentum after the close of world war i which had seen colonial troops fight alongside those of the metropole and us president woodrow wilsons speech on the fourteen points however it was not until the end of world war ii that they were fully mobilised british prime minister winston churchill and us president franklin d roosevelts 1941 atlantic charter declared that the signatories would respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live though churchill subsequently claimed this applied only to those countries under nazi occupation rather than the british empire the words were not so easily retracted for example the legislative assembly of britains most important colony india passed a resolution stating that the charter should apply to it tooin 1945 the united nations un was founded when 50 nations signed the un charter which included a statement of its basis in the respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples in 1952 demographer alfred sauvy coined the term third world in reference to the french third estate the expression distinguished nations that aligned themselves with neither the west nor the soviet bloc during the cold war in the following decades decolonization would strengthen this group which began to be represented at the united nations the third worlds first international move was the 1955 bandung conference led by jawaharlal nehru for india gamal abdel nasser for egypt and josip broz tito for yugoslavia the conference which gathered 29 countries representing over half the worlds population led to the creation of the non-aligned movement in 1961although the us had first opposed itself to colonial empires the cold war concerns about soviet influence in the third world caused it to downplay its advocacy of popular sovereignty and decolonization france thus had a free hand in the first indochina war 1946–54 and in the algerian war of independence 1954–62 decolonization itself was a seemingly unstoppable process in 1960 after a number countries gained independence the un had reached 99 members states the decolonization of africa was almost complete in 1980 the un had 154 member states and in 1990 after namibias independence 159 states


 role of the ussr and china 
the soviet union was a main supporter of decolonization movements while the non-aligned movement created in 1961 following the bandung 1955 conference was supposedly neutral the third world being opposed to both the first and the second worlds geopolitical concerns as well as the refusal of the us to support decolonization movements against its nato european allies led the national liberation movements to look increasingly toward the east however chinas appearance on the world scene under the leadership of mao zedong created a rupture between the soviet union and independentists movements globally the non-aligned movement led by jawaharlal nehru india josip broz tito yugoslavia and gamal abdel nasser egypt tried to create a block of nations powerful enough to be dependent on neither the united states nor the soviet union but finally tilted towards the ussr while smaller independence movements both by strategic necessity and ideological choice were supported either by moscow or by peking the cuban government led by fidel castro after the cuban revolution of 1959 was at first neutral before turning itself towards moscow cuba also sponsored independence movements in angola and mozambique few independence movements were totally independent from foreign aid


 postcolonialism 

postcolonialism is a term used to recognise the continued and troubling presence and influence of colonialism within the period we designate as after-the-colonial it refers to the ongoing effects that colonial encounters dispossession and power have in shaping the familiar structures social political spatial uneven global interdependencies of the present world postcolonialism in itself questions the end of colonialism
