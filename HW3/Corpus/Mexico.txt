 etymology 

mēxihco is the nahuatl term for the heartland of the aztec empire namely the valley of mexico and surrounding territories with its people being known  as the mexica it is generally believed to be a toponym for the valley which became the primary ethnonym for the aztec triple alliance as a result although it could have been the other way around in the colonial era back when mexico was called new spain this territory became the intendency of mexico and after new spain achieved independence from the spanish empire it came to be known as the state of mexico with the new country being named after its capital the city of mexico which itself was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient mexica capital of mexico-tenochtitlan
traditionally the name tenochtitlan was thought to come from nahuatl tetl ˈtetɬ rock and nōchtli ˈnoːtʃtɬi prickly pear and is often thought to mean among the prickly pears growing among rocks however one attestation in the late 16th-century manuscript known as the bancroft dialogues suggests the second vowel was short so that the true etymology remains uncertainthe suffix -co is the nahuatl locative making the word a place name beyond that the etymology is uncertain it has been suggested that it is derived from mextli or mēxihtli a secret name for the god of war and patron of the mexica huitzilopochtli in which case mēxihco means place where huitzilopochtli lives another hypothesis suggests that mēxihco derives from a portmanteau of the nahuatl words for moon mētztli and navel xīctli this meaning at the navel of the moon might refer to tenochtitlans position in the middle of lake texcoco the system of interconnected lakes of which texcoco formed the center had the form of a rabbit which the mesoamericans pareidolically associated with the moon rabbit still another hypothesis suggests that the word is derived from mēctli the name of the goddess of magueythe name of the city-state was transliterated to spanish as méxico with the phonetic value of the letter x in medieval spanish which represented the voiceless postalveolar fricative ʃ this sound as well as the voiced postalveolar fricative ʒ represented by a j evolved into a voiceless velar fricative x during the 16th century this led to the use of the variant méjico in many publications in spanish most notably in spain whereas in mexico and most other spanish–speaking countries méxico was the preferred spelling in recent years the real academia española which regulates the spanish language determined that both variants are acceptable in spanish but that the normative recommended spelling is méxico the majority of publications in all spanish-speaking countries now adhere to the new norm even though the alternative variant is still occasionally used in english the x in mexico represents neither the original nor the current sound but the consonant cluster ks
the official name of the country has changed as the form of government has changed the declaration of independence signed on november 6 1813 by the deputies of the congress of anáhuac called the territory américa septentrional northern america on two occasions 1821–1823 and 1863–1867 the country was known as imperio mexicano mexican empire all three federal constitutions 1824 1857 and 1917 the current constitution used the name estados unidos mexicanos—or the variant estados-unidos mexicanos all of which have been translated as united mexican states the phrase república mexicana mexican republic was used in the 1836 constitutional laws


 history 


 pre-columbian mexico 

the earliest human artifacts in mexico are chips of stone tools found near campfire remains in the valley of mexico and radiocarbon-dated to circa 10,000 years ago mexico is the site of the domestication of maize tomato and beans which produced an agricultural surplus this enabled the transition from paleo-indian hunter-gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 5000 bcin the subsequent formative eras maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a mythological and religious complex and a vigesimal numeric system were diffused from the mexican cultures to the rest of the mesoamerican culture area in this period villages became more dense in terms of population becoming socially stratified with an artisan class and developing into chiefdoms the most powerful rulers had religious and political power organizing construction of large ceremonial centers developedthe earliest complex civilization in mexico was the olmec culture which flourished on the gulf coast from around 1500 bc olmec cultural traits diffused through mexico into other formative-era cultures in chiapas oaxaca and the valley of mexico the formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions as well as artistic and architectural complexes the formative-era of mesoamerica is considered one of the six independent cradles of civilization

in the subsequent pre-classical period the maya and zapotec civilizations developed complex centers at calakmul and monte albán respectively during this period the first true mesoamerican writing systems were developed in the epi-olmec and the zapotec cultures the mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the classic maya hieroglyphic scriptin central mexico the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of teotihuacán which formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the maya area as well as north teotihuacan with a population of more than 150,000 people had some of the largest pyramidal structures in the pre-columbian americas after the collapse of teotihuacán around 600 ad competition ensued between several important political centers in central mexico such as xochicalco and cholula at this time during the epi-classic nahua peoples began moving south into mesoamerica from the north and became politically and culturally dominant in central mexico as they displaced speakers of oto-manguean languages


 post-classic period ca 1000–1519 ad 

during the early post-classic central mexico was dominated by the toltec culture oaxaca by the mixtec and the lowland maya area had important centers at chichén itzá and mayapán toward the end of the post-classic period the mexica established dominancealexander von humboldt originated the modern usage of aztec as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade custom religion and language to the mexica state and ēxcān tlahtōlōyān the triple alliance in 1843 with the publication of the work of william h prescott it was adopted by most of the world including 19th-century mexican scholars who considered it a way to distinguish present-day mexicans from pre-conquest mexicans this usage has been the subject of debate since the late 20th centurythe aztec empire was an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands it was satisfied with the payment of tributes from them it was a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected for example the southern peripheral zones of xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center the hegemonic nature of the aztec empire was demonstrated by their restoration of local rulers to their former position after their city-state was conquered the aztec did not interfere in local affairs as long as the tributes were paid

the aztec of central mexico built a tributary empire covering most of central mexico the aztec were noted for practicing human sacrifice on a large scale along with this practice they avoided killing enemies on the battlefield their warring casualty rate was far lower than that of their spanish counterparts whose principal objective was immediate slaughter during battle this distinct mesoamerican cultural tradition of human sacrifice ended with the gradually spanish conquest in the 16th century over the next centuries many mexican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected to spanish colonial rule by more conquests


 conquest of the aztec triple alliance 1519–1521 

the spanish first learned of mexico during the juan de grijalva expedition of 1518 the natives kept repeating colua colua and mexico mexico but we explorers did not know what colua or mexico meant until encountering montezumas governor at the mouth of the rio de las banderas  the spanish conquest of the aztec empire began in february 1519 when hernán cortés arrived at the port in veracruz with ca 500 conquistadores after taking control of that city he moved on to the aztec capital in his search for gold and other riches cortés decided to invade and conquer the aztec empirewhen the spaniards arrived the ruler of the aztec empire was moctezuma ii who was later killed his successor and brother cuitláhuac took control of the aztec empire but was among the first to fall from the first smallpox epidemic in the area a short time later unintentionally introduced by spanish conquerors among whom smallpox was endemic the infectious disease ravaged mesoamerica in the 1520s it killed more than 3 million natives as they had no immunity other sources however mentioned that the death toll of the aztecs might have reached 15 million out of a population of less than 30 million although such a high number conflicts with the 350,000 aztecs who ruled an empire of 5 million or 10 million severely weakened the aztec empire was easily defeated by cortés and his forces on his second return with the help of state of tlaxcala whose population estimate was 300,000 the native population declined 80–90% by 1600 to 1–2.5 million any population estimate of pre-columbian mexico is bound to be a guess but 8–12 million is often suggested for the area encompassed by the modern nation

smallpox was a devastating disease it generally killed aztecs but not spaniards who as europeans had already been exposed to it in their cities for centuries and therefore had developed acquired immunity the deaths caused by smallpox are believed to have triggered a rapid growth of christianity in mexico and the americas at first the aztecs believed the epidemic was a punishment from an angry god but they later accepted their fate and no longer resisted the spanish rule many of the surviving aztecs believed that smallpox could be credited to the superiority of the christian god which resulted in their acceptance of catholicism and yielding to the spanish rule throughout mexicothe territory became part of the spanish empire under the name of new spain in 1535 mexico city was systematically rebuilt by cortés following the fall of tenochtitlan in 1521 much of the identity traditions and architecture of mexico developed during the 286-year colonial period


 viceroyalty of new spain 1521–1821 

the capture of tenochtitlan and refounding of mexico city in 1521 was the beginning of a 286-year-long colonial era during which mexico was known as nueva españa new spain the kingdom of new spain was created from the remnants of the aztec hegemonic empire subsequent enlargements such as the conquest of the tarascan state resulted in the creation of the viceroyalty of new spain in 1535 the viceroyalty at its greatest extent included the territories of modern mexico central america as far south as costa rica and the western united states the viceregal capital mexico city also administrated the spanish west indies the caribbean the spanish east indies the philippines and spanish florida
the indigenous population stabilized around one to one and a half million individuals in the 17th century from the most commonly accepted five to ten million pre-contact population the population decline was primarily the result of communicable diseases particularly smallpox introduced during the columbian exchange during the three hundred years of the colonial era mexico received between 400,000 and 500,000 europeans between 200,000 and 250,000 africans and between 40,000 and 120,000 asians the 18th century saw a great increase in the percentage of mestizoscolonial law with spanish roots was introduced and attached to native customs creating a hierarchy between local jurisdiction the cabildos and the spanish crown upper administrative offices were closed to native-born people even those of pure spanish blood criollos administration was based on the racial separation among republics of spaniards amerindians and castas autonomous and directly dependent on the king himself

the council of indies and the mendicant religious orders which arrived in mesoamerica as early as 1524 labored to generate capital for the crown of spain and convert the amerindian populations to catholicism the 1531 marian apparitions to saint juan diego gave impetus to the evangelization of central mexico the virgin of guadalupe became a symbol of criollo patriotism and was used by the insurgents that followed miguel hidalgo during the war of independence some crypto-jewish families emigrated to mexico to escape the spanish inquisition
the rich deposits of silver particularly in zacatecas and guanajuato resulted in silver extraction dominating the economy of new spain taxes on silver production became a major source of income for spain other important industries were the haciendas functioning under the encomienda and repartimiento systems and mercantile activities in the main cities and ports wealth created during the colonial era spurred the development of new spanish baroque
as a result of its trade links with asia the rest of the americas africa and europe and the profound effect of new world silver central mexico was one of the first regions to be incorporated into a globalized economy being at the crossroads of trade people and cultures mexico city has been called the first world city the nao de china manila galleons operated for two and a half centuries and connected new spain with asia goods were taken from veracruz to atlantic ports in the americas and spain veracruz was also the main port of entry in mainland new spain for european goods immigrants and african slaves the camino real de tierra adentro connected mexico city with the interior of new spain mexican silver pesos became the first globally used currency and the silver mined in mexico were used to run commerce and wage crusades in two sides of globe at the mediterranean were spain fought against the ottoman caliphate and at southeast asia where the philippines fought against the brunei sultanate

due to the importance of new spain administrative base mexico was the location of the first printing shop 1539 first university 1551 first public park 1592 and first public library 1646 in the americas amongst other institutions important artists of the colonial period include the writers juan ruiz de alarcón and sor juana inés de la cruz painters cristóbal de villalpando and miguel cabrera and architect manuel tolsá the academy of san carlos was the first major school and museum of art in the americas scientist andrés manuel del río fernández discovered the element vanadium
spanish forces sometimes accompanied by native allies led expeditions to conquer territory or quell rebellions through the colonial era notable amerindian revolts in sporadically populated northern new spain include the chichimeca war 1576–1606 tepehuán revolt 1616–1620 and the pueblo revolt 1680 to protect mexico from the attacks of english french and dutch pirates and protect the crowns monopoly of revenue only two ports were open to foreign trade—veracruz on the atlantic and acapulco on the pacific among the best-known pirate attacks are the 1663 sack of campeche and 1683 attack on veracruz
many mexican cultural features including tequila first distilled in the 16th century charreria 17th mariachi 18th and mexican cuisine a fusion of american and european particularly spanish cuisine arose during the colonial era


 war of independence 1810–1821 

on september 16 1810 a loyalist revolt against the ruling junta was declared by priest miguel hidalgo y costilla in the small town of dolores guanajuato this event known as the cry of dolores spanish grito de dolores is commemorated each year on september 16 as mexicos independence day the first insurgent group was formed by hidalgo the spanish viceregal army captain ignacio allende the militia captain juan aldama and la corregidora josefa ortiz de domínguez hidalgo and some of his soldiers were captured and executed by firing squad in chihuahua on july 31 1811 following his death the leadership was assumed by priest josé maría morelos who occupied key southern cities
in 1813 the congress of chilpancingo was convened and on november 6 signed the solemn act of the declaration of independence of northern america morelos was captured and executed on december 22 1815

in subsequent years the insurgency was near collapse but in 1820 viceroy juan ruiz de apodaca sent an army under the criollo general agustín de iturbide against the troops of vicente guerrero instead iturbide approached guerrero to join forces and on august 24 1821 representatives of the spanish crown and iturbide signed the treaty of córdoba and the declaration of independence of the mexican empire which recognized the independence of mexico under the terms of the plan of iguala
mexicos short recovery after the war of independence was soon cut short again by the civil wars and institutional instability of the 1850s which lasted until the government of porfirio díaz reestablished conditions that paved the way for economic growth the conflicts that arose from the mid-1850s had a profound effect because they were widespread and made themselves perceptible in the vast rural areas of the countries involved clashes between castes different ethnic groups and haciendas and entailed a deepening of the political and ideological divisions between republicans and monarchists


 first empire and first republic 1821–1846 

agustín de iturbide became constitutional emperor of the first mexican empire in 1822 a revolt against him in 1823 established the united mexican states in 1824 a republican constitution was drafted and guadalupe victoria became the first president of the newly born country central america including chiapas left the union in 1829 president guerrero abolished slavery the first decades of the post-independence period were marked by economic instability which led to the pastry war in 1836 there was constant strife between liberals supporters of a federal form of government and conservatives who proposed a hierarchical form of governmentduring this period the frontier borderlands to the north became quite isolated from the government in mexico city and its monopolistic economic policies caused suffering with limited trade the people had difficulty meeting tax payments and resented the central governments actions in collecting customs resentment built up from california to texas both the mission system and the presidios had collapsed after the spanish withdrew from the colony causing great disruption especially in alta california and new mexico the people in the borderlands had to raise local militias to protect themselves from hostile native americans these areas developed in different directions from the center of the countrywanting to stabilize and develop the frontier mexico encouraged immigration into present-day texas as they were unable to persuade people from central mexico to move into those areas they allowed for religious freedom for the new settlers who were primarily protestant english speakers from the united states within several years the anglos far outnumbered the tejano in the area itinerant traders traveled through the area working by free market principles the tejano grew more separate from the government and due to its neglect many supported the idea of independence and joined movements to that end collaborating with the english-speaking americansgeneral antonio lópez de santa anna a centralist and two-time dictator approved the siete leyes in 1836 a radical amendment that institutionalized the centralized form of government when he suspended the 1824 constitution civil war spread across the country three new governments declared independence the republic of texas the republic of the rio grande and the republic of yucatán


 second republic and second empire 1846–1867 

the 1846 united states annexation of the republic of texas and subsequent american military incursion into territory that was part of coahuila also claimed by texas instigated the mexican–american war the war was settled in 1848 via the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo mexico was forced to give up more than one-third of its land to the us including alta california santa fe de nuevo méxico and the territory claimed by texas a much smaller transfer of territory in what is today southern arizona and southwestern new mexico—known as the gadsden purchase—occurred in 1854the caste war of yucatán the maya uprising that began in 1847 was one of the most successful modern native american revolts maya rebels or cruzob maintained relatively independent enclaves in the peninsula until the 1930sdissatisfaction with santa annas return to power led to the liberal plan of ayutla initiating an era known as la reforma the new constitution drafted in 1857 established a secular state federalism as the form of government and several freedoms as the conservatives refused to recognize it the reform war began in 1858 during which both groups had their own governments the war ended in 1861 with victory by the liberals led by president benito juárez who was an ethnic zapotec
in the 1860s mexico was occupied by france which established the second mexican empire under the rule of the habsburg archduke ferdinand maximilian of austria with support from the roman catholic clergy and the conservatives the latter switched sides and joined the liberals maximilian surrendered was tried on june 14 1867 and was executed a few days later on june 19 in querétaro


 porfiriato 1876–1911 

porfirio díaz a republican general during the french intervention was elected the 29th president in 1876 the 1880 election was won by manuel gonzález flores díaz was reelected in 1884 and ruled until 1911 the period known as the porfiriato was characterized by economic stability and growth significant foreign investment and influence investments in the arts and sciences and an expansion of the railroad network and telecommunications the period was concurrent with the gilded age in the us and belle époque in france and was also marked by economic inequality and political repression
díaz ruled with a group of confidants that became known as the científicos scientists the most influential cientifco was secretary of finance josé yves limantour the porfirian regime was influenced by positivism they rejected theology and idealism in favor of scientific methods being applied towards national development various iconic buildings and monuments were initiated by díaz including the palacio de bellas artes palacio de correos de mexico monumento a la independencia and the palacio legislativo which became the monumento a la revolución


 mexican revolution 1910–1920 

president díaz announced in 1908 that he would retire in 1911 resulting in the development of new coalitions but then he ran for reelection anyway and in a show of us support díaz and william howard taft planned a summit in el paso texas and ciudad juárez mexico for october 16 1909 an historic first meeting between a mexican and a us president and also the first time an american president would cross the border into mexico both sides agreed that the disputed chamizal strip connecting el paso to ciudad juárez would be considered neutral territory with no flags present during the summit but the meeting focused attention on this territory and resulted in assassination threats and other serious security concernson the day of the summit frederick russell burnham the celebrated scout and private cr moore a texas ranger discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the el paso chamber of commerce building along the procession route and they disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of díaz and taft both presidents were unharmed and the summit was held díaz was re-elected in 1910 but alleged electoral fraud forced him into exile in france and sparked the 1910 mexican revolution initially led by francisco i madero
madero was elected president but overthrown and murdered in a coup détat two years later directed by conservative general victoriano huerta that event re-ignited the civil war involving figures such as francisco villa and emiliano zapata who formed their own forces a third force the constitutional army led by venustiano carranza managed to bring an end to the war and radically amended the 1857 constitution to include many of the social premises and demands of the revolutionaries into what was eventually called the 1917 constitution it is estimated that the war killed 900,000 of the 1910 population of 15 millionassassinated in 1920 carranza was succeeded by another revolutionary hero álvaro obregón who in turn was succeeded by plutarco elías calles obregón was reelected in 1928 but was assassinated before he could assume power although this period is usually referred to as the mexican revolution it might also be termed a civil war since president díaz 1909 narrowly escaped assassination and presidents francisco i madero 1913 venustiano carranza 1920 álvaro obregón 1928 and former revolutionary leaders emiliano zapata 1919 and pancho villa 1923 all were assassinated during this period


 early-20th-century stability and one-party rule 1920–2000 
in 1929 calles founded the national revolutionary party pnr later renamed the institutional revolutionary party pri and started a period known as the maximato which ended with the election of lázaro cárdenas who implemented many economic and social reforms this included the mexican oil expropriation in march 1938 which nationalized the us and anglo-dutch oil company known as the mexican eagle petroleum company this movement would result in the creation of the state-owned mexican oil company known as pemex this sparked a diplomatic crisis with the countries whose citizens had lost businesses by cárdenas radical measure but since then the company has played an important role in the economic development of mexico

between 1940 and 1980 mexico remained a poor country but experienced substantial economic growth that some historians call the mexican miracle although the economy continued to flourish for some social inequality remained a factor of discontent moreover the pri rule became increasingly authoritarian and at times oppressive in what is now referred to as mexicos dirty war see the 1968 tlatelolco massacre which claimed the life of around 300 protesters based on conservative estimates and as many as 800 protesterselectoral reforms and high oil prices followed the administration of luis echeverría mismanagement of these revenues led to inflation and exacerbated the 1982 crisis that year oil prices plunged interest rates soared and the government defaulted on its debt president miguel de la madrid resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked inflation
in the 1980s the first cracks emerged in pris dominance in baja california ernesto ruffo appel was elected as governor in 1988 alleged electoral fraud prevented the leftist candidate cuauhtémoc cárdenas from winning the national presidential elections giving carlos salinas de gortari the presidency and leading to massive protests in mexico city

salinas embarked on a program of neoliberal reforms which fixed the exchange rate controlled inflation and culminated with the signing of the north american free trade agreement nafta which came into effect on january 1 1994 the same day the zapatista army of national liberation ezln started a two-week-long armed rebellion against the federal government and has continued as a non-violent opposition movement against neoliberalism and globalization
in 1994 salinas was succeeded by ernesto zedillo followed by the mexican peso crisis and a 50 billion imf bailout major macroeconomic reforms were started by president zedillo and the economy rapidly recovered and growth peaked at almost 7% by the end of 1999


 contemporary mexico 
in 2000 after 71 years the pri lost a presidential election to vicente fox of the opposition national action party pan in the 2006 presidential election felipe calderón from the pan was declared the winner with a very narrow margin over leftist politician andrés manuel lópez obrador of the party of the democratic revolution prd lópez obrador however contested the election and pledged to create an alternative governmentafter twelve years in 2012 the pri won the presidency again with the election of enrique peña nieto the governor of the state of mexico from 2005 to 2011 however he won with a plurality of about 38 and did not have a legislative majorityin his third presidential run former mayor of mexico city andrés manuel lópez obrador won the 2018 presidential election with over 50% of the vote his political coalition led by left-wing party morena which was founded after the 2012 elections by andres includes parties and politicians from all over the political spectrum and also obtained a majority in both the upper and lower congress chambers amlos one of his many nicknames success is attributed to the countrys other strong political alternatives exhausting their chances as well as the politician adopting a moderate discourse with focus in conciliation


 geography 

mexico is located between latitudes 14° and 33°n and longitudes 86° and 119°w in the southern portion of north america almost all of mexico lies in the north american plate with small parts of the baja california peninsula on the pacific and cocos plates geophysically some geographers include the territory east of the isthmus of tehuantepec around 12% of the total within central america geopolitically however mexico is entirely considered part of north america along with canada and the united statesmexicos total area is 1,972,550 km2 761,606 sq mi making it the worlds 13th largest country by total area it has coastlines on the pacific ocean and gulf of california as well as the gulf of mexico and caribbean sea the latter two forming part of the atlantic ocean within these seas are about 6,000 km2 2,317 sq mi of islands including the remote pacific guadalupe island and the revillagigedo islands from its farthest land points mexico is a little over 2,000 mi 3,219 km in length
on its north mexico shares a 3,141 km 1,952 mi border with the united states the meandering río bravo del norte known as the rio grande in the united states defines the border from ciudad juárez east to the gulf of mexico a series of natural and artificial markers delineate the united states-mexican border west from ciudad juárez to the pacific ocean donald trump made the construction of a border wall on the us side an element of his 2016 presidential campaign on its south mexico shares an 871 km 541 mi border with guatemala and a 251 km 156 mi border with belize
mexico is crossed from north to south by two mountain ranges known as sierra madre oriental and sierra madre occidental which are the extension of the rocky mountains from northern north america from east to west at the center the country is crossed by the trans-mexican volcanic belt also known as the sierra nevada a fourth mountain range the sierra madre del sur runs from michoacán to oaxacaas such the majority of the mexican central and northern territories are located at high altitudes and the highest elevations are found at the trans-mexican volcanic belt pico de orizaba 5,700 m or 18,701 ft popocatépetl 5,462 m or 17,920 ft and iztaccihuatl 5,286 m or 17,343 ft and the nevado de toluca 4,577 m or 15,016 ft three major urban agglomerations are located in the valleys between these four elevations toluca greater mexico city and puebla


 climate 

the tropic of cancer effectively divides the country into temperate and tropical zones land north of the twenty-fourth parallel experiences cooler temperatures during the winter months south of the twenty-fourth parallel temperatures are fairly constant year round and vary solely as a function of elevation this gives mexico one of the worlds most diverse weather systems
areas south of the 24th parallel with elevations up to 1,000 m 3,281 ft the southern parts of both coastal plains as well as the yucatán peninsula have a yearly median temperature between 24 to 28 °c 75.2 to 82.4 °f temperatures here remain high throughout the year with only a 5 °c 9 °f difference between winter and summer median temperatures both mexican coasts except for the south coast of the bay of campeche and northern baja are also vulnerable to serious hurricanes during the summer and fall although low-lying areas north of the 24th parallel are hot and humid during the summer they generally have lower yearly temperature averages from 20 to 24 °c or 68.0 to 75.2 °f because of more moderate conditions during the winter
many large cities in mexico are located in the valley of mexico or in adjacent valleys with altitudes generally above 2,000 m 6,562 ft this gives them a year-round temperate climate with yearly temperature averages from 16 to 18 °c or 60.8 to 64.4 °f and cool nighttime temperatures throughout the year
many parts of mexico particularly the north have a dry climate with sporadic rainfall while parts of the tropical lowlands in the south average more than 2,000 mm 78.7 in of annual precipitation for example many cities in the north like monterrey hermosillo and mexicali experience temperatures of 40 °c 104 °f or more in summer in the sonoran desert temperatures reach 50 °c 122 °f or more
in 2012 mexico passed a comprehensive climate change bill a first in the developing world that has set a goal for the country to generate 35% of its energy from clean energy sources by 2024 and to cut emissions by 50% by 2050 from the level found in 2000 during the 2016 north american leaders summit the target of 50% of electricity generated from renewable sources by 2025 was announced


 biodiversity 

mexico ranks fourth in the world in biodiversity and is one of the 17 megadiverse countries with over 200,000 different species mexico is home of 10–12% of the worlds biodiversity mexico ranks first in biodiversity in reptiles with 707 known species second in mammals with 438 species fourth in amphibians with 290 species and fourth in flora with 26,000 different species mexico is also considered the second country in the world in ecosystems and fourth in overall species about 2,500 species are protected by mexican legislationsin 2002 mexico had the second fastest rate of deforestation in the world second only to brazil the government has taken another initiative in the late 1990s to broaden the peoples knowledge interest and use of the countrys esteemed biodiversity through the comisión nacional para el conocimiento y uso de la biodiversidad
in mexico 170,000 square kilometres 65,637 sq mi are considered protected natural areas these include 34 biosphere reserves unaltered ecosystems 67 national parks 4 natural monuments protected in perpetuity for their aesthetic scientific or historical value 26 areas of protected flora and fauna 4 areas for natural resource protection conservation of soil hydrological basins and forests and 17 sanctuaries zones rich in diverse speciesthe discovery of the americas brought to the rest of the world many widely used food crops and edible plants some of mexicos native culinary ingredients include chocolate avocado tomato maize vanilla guava chayote epazote camote jícama nopal zucchini tejocote huitlacoche sapote mamey sapote many varieties of beans and an even greater variety of chiles such as the habanero and the jalapeño most of these names come from indigenous languages like nahuatl
because of its high biodiversity mexico has also been a frequent site of bioprospecting by international research bodies the first highly successful instance being the discovery in 1947 of the tuber barbasco dioscorea composita which has a high content of diosgenin revolutionizing the production of synthetic hormones in the 1950s and 1960s and eventually leading to the invention of combined oral contraceptive pills

 law enforcement 

public security is enacted at the three levels of government each of which has different prerogatives and responsibilities local and state police departments are primarily in charge of law enforcement whereas the mexican federal police are in charge of specialized duties all levels report to the secretaría de seguridad pública secretary of public security the general attorneys office procuraduría general de la república pgr is the executive powers agency in charge of investigating and prosecuting crimes at the federal level mainly those related to drug and arms trafficking espionage and bank robberies the pgr operates the federal ministerial police policia federal ministerial pmf an investigative and preventive agencywhile the government generally respects the human rights of its citizens serious abuses of power have been reported in security operations in the southern part of the country and in indigenous communities and poor urban neighborhoods the national human rights commission has had little impact in reversing this trend engaging mostly in documentation but failing to use its powers to issue public condemnations to the officials who ignore its recommendations by law all defendants have the rights that assure them fair trials and humane treatment however the system is overburdened and overwhelmed with several problemsdespite the efforts of the authorities to fight crime and fraud most mexicans have low confidence in the police or the judicial system and therefore few crimes are actually reported by the citizens the global integrity index which measures the existence and effectiveness of national anti-corruption mechanisms rated mexico 31st behind kenya thailand and russia in 2008 president calderón proposed a major reform of the judicial system which was approved by the congress of the union which included oral trials the presumption of innocence for defendants the authority of local police to investigate crime—until then a prerogative of special police units—and several other changes intended to speed up trials


 crime

 military 

the mexican armed forces have two branches the mexican army which includes the mexican air force and the mexican navy the mexican armed forces maintain significant infrastructure including facilities for design research and testing of weapons vehicles aircraft naval vessels defense systems and electronics military industry manufacturing centers for building such systems and advanced naval dockyards that build heavy military vessels and advanced missile technologies

in recent years mexico has improved its training techniques military command and information structures and has taken steps to becoming more self-reliant in supplying its military by designing as well as manufacturing its own arms missiles aircraft vehicles heavy weaponry electronics defense systems armor heavy military industrial equipment and heavy naval vessels since the 1990s when the military escalated its role in the war on drugs increasing importance has been placed on acquiring airborne surveillance platforms aircraft helicopters digital war-fighting technologies urban warfare equipment and rapid troop transportmexico has the capabilities to manufacture nuclear weapons but abandoned this possibility with the treaty of tlatelolco in 1968 and pledged to only use its nuclear technology for peaceful purposes in 1970 mexicos national institute for nuclear research successfully refined weapons grade uranium which is used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons but in april 2010 mexico agreed to turn over its weapons grade uranium to the united stateshistorically mexico has remained neutral in international conflicts with the exception of world war ii however in recent years some political parties have proposed an amendment of the constitution to allow the mexican army air force or navy to collaborate with the united nations in peacekeeping missions or to provide military help to countries that officially ask for it


 administrative divisions

 economy 

mexico has the 15th largest nominal gdp and the 11th largest by purchasing power parity gdp annual average growth for the period of 1995–2002 was 5.1 mexicos gross domestic product gdp in purchasing power parity ppp was estimated at us2.2602 trillion in 2015 and 1.3673 trillion in nominal exchange rates mexicos gdp in ppp per capita was us18,714.05 the world bank reported in 2009 that the countrys gross national income in market exchange rates was the second highest in latin america after brazil at us1,830.392 billion which lead to the highest income per capita in the region at 15,311 mexico is now firmly established as an upper middle-income country after the slowdown of 2001 the country has recovered and has grown 4.2 3.0 and 4.8 percent in 2004 2005 and 2006 even though it is considered to be well below mexicos potential growth furthermore after the 2008–2009 recession the economy grew an average of 3.32 percent per year from 2010 to 2014
since late 90s the majority of the population has been considered to be part of the growing middle class by international economic organizations but according to mexicos national council for the evaluation of social development policy coneval from 2006 to 2010 the portion of the population who lives in poverty rose from 18-19% to 46% 52 million people however rather than mexicos economy crashing international economists attribute the huge increase in the percentage of population living below the countrys poverty line to the coneval using new standards to define it as now besides people who lives below the economic welfare line people who lacks at least one social need such as complete education access to healthcare access to regular food housing services and goods social security etc were considered to be living in poverty several countries do collect information regarding the persistence of said vulnerabilities on their population but mexico is the only one that classifies people lacking one or more of those needs as living below its national poverty line said economists do point out that the percentage of people living in poverty according to mexicos national poverty line is around 40 times higher than the one reported by the world banks international poverty line with said difference being the biggest in the world and ponder if it wouldnt be better for countries in the situation of mexico to adopt internationalized standards to measure poverty so the numbers obtained could be used to make accurate international comparisons according to the oecds own poverty line defined as the percentage of a countrys population who earns half or less of the national median income 21.5% of mexicos population lives in situation of povertyamong the oecd countries mexico has the second highest degree of economic disparity between the extremely poor and extremely rich after chile – although it has been falling over the last decade being one of few countries on which this is the case the bottom ten percent in the income hierarchy disposes of 1.36% of the countrys resources whereas the upper ten percent dispose of almost 36 the oecd also notes that mexicos budgeted expenses for poverty alleviation and social development is only about a third of the oecd average this is also reflected by the fact that infant mortality in mexico is three times higher than the average among oecd nations whereas its literacy levels are in the median range of oecd nations nevertheless according to goldman sachs by 2050 mexico will have the 5th largest economy in the worldaccording to a 2008 un report the average income in a typical urbanized area of mexico was 26,654 while the average income in rural areas just miles away was only 8,403 daily

 science and technology 

the national autonomous university of mexico was officially established in 1910 and the university became one of the most important institutes of higher learning in mexico unam provides world class education in science medicine and engineering many scientific institutes and new institutes of higher learning such as national polytechnic institute founded in 1936 were established during the first half of the 20th century most of the new research institutes were created within unam twelve institutes were integrated into unam from 1929 to 1973 in 1959 the mexican academy of sciences was created to coordinate scientific efforts between academics
in 1995 the mexican chemist mario j molina shared the nobel prize in chemistry with paul j crutzen and f sherwood rowland for their work in atmospheric chemistry particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone molina an alumnus of unam became the first mexican citizen to win the nobel prize in sciencein recent years the largest scientific project being developed in mexico was the construction of the large millimeter telescope gran telescopio milimétrico gmt the worlds largest and most sensitive single-aperture telescope in its frequency range it was designed to observe regions of space obscured by stellar dust

 water supply and sanitation 

among the achievements is a significant increase in access to piped water supply in urban areas 88% to 93 as well as in rural areas 50% to 74 between 1990 and 2010 additionally a strong nationwide increase in access to improved sanitation 64% to 85 was observed in the same period other achievements include the existence of a functioning national system to finance water and sanitation infrastructure with a national water commission as its apex institution and the existence of a few well-performing utilities such as aguas y drenaje de monterrey
the challenges include water scarcity in the northern and central parts of the country inadequate water service quality drinking water quality 11% of mexicans receiving water only intermittently as of 2014 poor technical and commercial efficiency of most utilities with an average level of non-revenue water of 43.2% in 2010 an insufficient share of wastewater receiving treatment 36% in 2006 and still inadequate access in rural areas in addition to on-going investments to expand access the government has embarked on a large investment program to improve wastewater treatment


 demographics 

throughout the 19th century the population of mexico had barely doubled this trend continued during the first two decades of the 20th century and even in the 1920 census there was a loss of about 2 million inhabitants the phenomenon can be explained because during the decade from 1910 to 1920 the mexican revolution took place

the growth rate increased dramatically between the 1930s and the 1980s when the country registered growth rates of over 3% 1950–1980 the mexican population doubled in twenty years and at that rate it was expected that by the year 2000 there would be 120 million mexicans life expectancy went from 36 years in 1895 to 72 years in the year 2000
according to estimations made by mexicos national geography and statistics institute as of 2017 mexico has 123.5 million inhabitants making it the most populous spanish-speaking country in the world between 2005 and 2010 the mexican population grew at an average of 1.70% per year up from 1.16% per year between 2000 and 2005
even though mexico is a very ethnically diverse country research about ethnicity has largely been a forgotten field in consequence of the post-revolutionary efforts of mexicos government to unify all non-indigenous mexicans under a single ethnic identity that of the mestizo as a result since 1930 the only explicit ethnic classification that has been included in mexican censuses has been that of indigenous peoples even then across the years the government has used different criteria to count indigenous peoples with each of them returning considerably different numbers it is not until very recently that the mexican government begun conducting surveys that considered the afro-mexican and euro-mexican population that lives in the country
as of  2017 it is estimated that 1.2 million foreigners have settled in the country up from nearly 1 million in 2010 the vast majority of migrants come from the united states 900,000 making mexico the top destination for us citizens abroad the second largest group comes from neighboring guatemala 54,500 followed by spain 27,600 other major sources of migration are fellow latin american countries which include colombia 20,600 argentina 19,200 and cuba 18,100 historically the lebanese diaspora and the german-born mennonite migration have left a notorious impact in the countrys culture particularly in its cuisine and traditional music at the turn of the 21st century several trends have increased the number of foreigners residing in the country such as the 2008–2014 spanish financial crisis increasing gang-related violence in the northern triangle of central america the ongoing political and economic crisis in venezuela and the automotive industry boom led by japanese and south korean investment


 ethnicity and race 

mexico is ethnically diverse with people of several ethnicities being united under a single national identity the core part of mexican national identity is formed on the basis of a synthesis of cultures primarily european culture and indigenous cultures in a process known as mestizaje mexican politicians and reformers such as josé vasconcelos promoter of the cosmic race and manuel gamio promoter of indigenismo were instrumental in building a mexican national identity on the concept of mestizajethe large majority of mexicans have historically been classified as mestizos in modern mexican usage the term mestizo is primarily a cultural identity rather than the racial identity it was during the colonial era resulting in individuals with varying phenotypes being classified under the same identity regardless of whether they are of mixed ancestry or not in the yucatán peninsula the word mestizo has a different meaning being used to refer to the maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities because during the caste war of the late 19th century those maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos in chiapas the word ladino is used instead of mestizo due the different definitions and socio-cultural connotations the term has carried through history it was deemed too imprecise to be used for ethnic classification which led to it being abandoned by the government and the mexican society with its use being limited to intellectual circles according to the mexican census of 1921 and publications who retake its results such as  encyclopædia britannica the majority of mexicans from 50% to 67% of the countrys population identify as mestizo although modern research has observed that when asked directly about their ethno-racial identification many mexicans do not identify as mestizosthe total percentage of mexicos population who is indigenous varies considerably depending of the criteria used by the government on its censuses it is 5.4% if the ability to speak an indigenous language is used as the criteria to define a person as indigenous if racial self-identification is used it is 14.9% and if people who consider themselves part indigenous are also included it amounts to 23 nonetheless all the censuses conclude that the majority of mexicos indigenous population is concentrated in rural areas of the southern and south-eastern mexican states such as yucatán at 59 quintana roo 39% and campeche 27 who are chiefly maya oaxaca with 48% of the population the most numerous groups being the mixtec and zapotec peoples chiapas at 28 the majority being tzeltal and tzotzil maya hidalgo 24 the majority being otomi puebla 19 and guerrero 17 mostly nahua peoples and the states of san luis potosí and veracruz are both home to a population that is 15% indigenous mostly from the totonac nahua and teenek huastec groups the absolute numbers of the indigenous population are growing but at a slower rate than the rest of the population so that the percentage of indigenous peoples in regards to total population is nonetheless falling all of the indices of social development for the indigenous population are considerably lower than the national average even though the indigenous population participates in the workforce longer than the national average with 55% of the indigenous population receiving less than a minimum salary compared to 20% for the national average many practice subsistence agriculture and regulate some internal issues under customary lawsimilarly to mestizo and indigenous peoples estimations for the percentage of european-descended mexicans within the mexican population vary considerably according to the encyclopædia britannica which uses as reference the 1921 census their numbers range from around 10–20 the results of the 1921 census however have been contested by various historians and deemed inaccurate recent field surveys that account for different phenotypical trais hair color skin color etc in the other hand report rather higher percentages with it reaching 47% according to a survey carried out by the mexican government with the aim to address ethnic discrimination in the country while during the colonial era most of the european migration into mexico was spanish in the 19th and 20th centuries a substantial number of non-spanish europeans immigrated to the country according to 20th- and 21st-century academics large scale intermixing between european immigrants and native indigenous peoples would produce a mestizo group which would become the overwhelming majority of mexicos population by the time of the mexican revolution however according to church registers from the colonial times the majority of european men married with european women said registers also put in question other narratives held by contemporary academics such as european migrants who arrived in mexico being almost exclusively men or that pure spanish people were all part of a small powerful elite as spaniards were often the most numerous ethnic group in the colonial cities and there were menial workers and people in poverty who were of complete spanish origin nowadays mexicos northern and western regions have the highest european populations with the majority of the people not having native admixture or being of predominantly european ancestry

the afro-mexican population 1,381,853 individuals as of  2015 is an ethnic group made up of descendants of colonial-era slaves and recent immigrants of sub-saharan african descent mexico had an active slave trade during the colonial period and some 200,000 africans were taken there primarily in the 17th century the creation of a national mexican identity especially after the mexican revolution emphasized mexicos indigenous and european past it passively eliminated the african ancestors and contributions most of the african-descended population was absorbed into the surrounding mestizo mixed europeanindigenous and indigenous populations through unions among the groups evidence of this long history of intermarriage with mestizo and indigenous mexicans is also expressed in the fact that in the 2015 inter-census 64.9% 896,829 of afro-mexicans also identified as indigenous it was also reported that 9.3% of afro-mexicans speak an indigenous language the states with the highest self-report of afro-mexicans were guerrero 6.5% of the population oaxaca 4.95 and veracruz 3.28 afro-mexican culture is strongest in the communities of the costa chica of oaxaca and costa chica of guerrero
during the early 20th century a substantial number of arabs mostly christians began arriving from the crumbling ottoman empire the largest group were the lebanese and an estimated 400,000 mexicans have some lebanese ancestry smaller ethnic groups in mexico include south and east asians present since the colonial era during the colonial era asians were termed chino regardless of ethnicity and arrived as merchants artisans and slaves a study by juan esteban rodríguez a graduate student at the national laboratory of genomics for biodiversity indicated that up to one third of people sampled from guerrero state had significantly more asian ancestry than most mexicans primarily filipino or indonesian modern asian immigration began in the late 19th century and at one point in the early 20th century the chinese were the second largest immigrant group


 official censuses 
the first census in mexico then known as new spain that included an ethnic classification was the 1793 census also known as the revillagigedo census most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost thus most of what is known about it nowadays comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works such as prussian geographer alexander von humboldt according to said works europeans ranged from 18% to 22% of new spains population mestizos from 21% to 25 indians from 51% to 61% and africans were between 6,000 and 10,000 the total population ranged from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354 it is concluded that the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even while the percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13–17% per century mostly due the later having higher mortality rates for living in remote locations and being in constant war with the colonists anthropologist gonzalo aguirre beltrán goes beyond said numbers and splits the mestizo group into euromestizos indomestizos and afromestizos calculating their numbers at more than one million 700,000 and 600,000 respectively independent-era mexico eliminated the legal basis of the colonial caste system which led to exclusion of racial classification in the censuses to come
according to mexicos second census ever that considered race made right after the mexican revolution in 1921 59% of mexicos population was mestizo 29% was indigenous and only 9% was european with mestizos being the most numerous ethno-racial group in almost all the states for a long time this census results were taken as fact with extraofficial international publications such as the world factbook and encyclopædia britannica using them as a reference to estimate mexicos racial composition up to this day in recent time nonetheless mexican academics have subjected the census results to scrutiny claiming that such a drastic alteration in demographic trends in regards to the 1793 census is not possible and cite among other statistics the relatively low frequency of marriages between people of different continental ancestries in colonial and early independent mexico said authors claim that the mexican society went through a more cultural than biological mestizaje process sponsored by the state in its efforts to unify the mexican population which resulted in the inflation of the percentage of the mestizo mexican group at the expense of the identity of the other races that exist in mexicoin recent times the mexican government has decided to conduct new ethnic surveys and censuses also widening the criteria to classify the ethnicities who were already considered such as the indigenous mexican one which was previously reserved to people who lived in indigenous communities or spoke an indigenous language according to these recent surveys indigenous peoples amount to 23% of mexicos population including people who declared to be partially indigenous afro-mexicans are 2% of mexicos population including people who declared to be partially african and european mexicans amount to 47% of mexicos population based on appearance rather than on self-declared of ancestry less numerous groups in mexico such as asians and middle easterners are also accounted for out of all the ethnic groups that have recently been surveyed that of mestizos is notably absent which may be consequence of the ethnic labels fluid and subjective definition which complicates a precise calculation as well the tendency that mexicans have to identify people with static ethnic labels rather than fluid ones


 emigration 

in the early 1960s around 600,000 mexicans lived abroad which increased sevenfold by the 1990s to 4.4 million at the turn of the 21st century this figure more than doubled to 9.5 million as of 2017 it is estimated that 12.9 million mexicans live abroad primarily in the united states which concentrates nearly 98% of the expatriate population majority of mexicans have settled in states such as california texas and illinois particularly around the metropolitan areas of los angeles chicago houston and dallas-fort worth as a result of these major migration flows in recent decades around 36 million us residents or 11.2% of the countrys population identified as being of full or partial mexican ancestry the remaining 2% of expatriates have settled in canada 86,000 primarily in the provinces of ontario and quebec followed by spain 49,000 and germany 18,000 both european destinations represent almost two-thirds of the mexican population living in the continent as for latin america it is estimated that 69,000 mexicans live in the region guatemala 18,000 being the top destination for expatriates followed by bolivia 10,000 and panama 5,000


 languages 

spanish is the de facto national language spoken by the vast majority of the population making mexico the worlds most populous hispanophone country mexican spanish is the set of varieties of the language spoken in the country which differs from one region to another phonetically syntactically and lexically in general mexican spanish does not make any phonetic distinction among the letters s and z as well as c when preceding the vowels e and i as opposed to peninsular spanish the letters b and v have the same pronunciation as well furthermore the usage of vos the second person singular pronoun found in several latin american varieties is replaced by tú whereas vosotros the second person plural pronoun fell out of use and was effectively replaced by ustedes in written form the spanish royal academy serves as the primary guideline for spelling except for words of amerindian origin that retain their original phonology such as cenzontle instead of sinzontle and méxico not méjico words of foreign origin also maintain their original spelling such as whisky and film as opposed to güisqui and filme as the royal academy suggests the letter x is distinctly used in mexican spanish which may be pronounced as ks as in oxígeno or taxi as ʃ particularly in amerindian words eg mixiote xola and uxmal and as the voiceless velar fricative x such as texas and oaxacathe federal government officially recognizes sixty-eight linguistic groups and 364 varieties of indigenous languages it is estimated that around 8.3 million citizens speak these languages with nahuatl being the most widely spoken by more than 1.7 million followed by yucatec maya used daily by nearly 850,000 people tzeltal and tzotzil two variants of the mayan languages are spoken by around half a million people each primarily in the southern state of chiapas mixtec and zapotec both with estimated 500,000 native speakers each are two other notorious language groups since its creation in march 2003 the national indigenous languages institute has been in charge of promoting and protecting the use of the countrys indigenous languages through the general law of indigenous peoples linguistic rights which recognizes them de jure as national languages with equal status as that of spanish notwithstanding in practice indigenous peoples often face discrimination and are unable to have proper access to public services such as education and healthcare as well as the justice system as spanish is the prominent language

aside from indigenous languages there are several minority languages spoken in mexico due to international migration such as low german by the 80,000-strong menonite population primarily settled in the northern states fuelled by the tolerance of the federal government towards this community by allowing them to set their own educational system compatible with their customs and traditions the chipilo dialect a variance of the venetian language is spoken in the town of chipilo located in the central state of puebla by around 2,500 people mainly descendants of venetians that migrated to the area in the late 19th century furthermore english is the most commonly taught foreign language in mexico it is estimated that nearly 24 million or around a fifth of the population study the language through public schools private institutions or self-access channels however a high level of english proficiency is limited to only 5% of the population moreover french is the second most widely taught foreign language as every year between 200,000 and 250,000 mexican students enroll in language courses


 urban areas 

here are the 20 largest urban areas in mexico


 religion 

the 2010 census by the instituto nacional de estadística y geografía national institute of statistics and geography gave roman catholicism as the main religion with 83% of the population while 10% 10,924,103 belong to other christian denominations including evangelicals 5 pentecostals 1.6 other protestant or reformed 0.7 jehovahs witnesses 1.4 seventh-day adventists 0.6 and members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints 0.3 172,891 or less than 0.2% of the total belonged to other non-christian religions 4.7% declared having no religion 2.7% were unspecified

the 92,924,489 catholics of mexico constitute in absolute terms the second largest catholic community in the world after brazils 47% percent of them attend church services weekly the feast day of our lady of guadalupe the patron saint of mexico is celebrated on december 12 and is regarded by many mexicans as the most important religious holiday of their country in spite of this the mexican state is officially lay secularist since the separation between religious institutions and the political administration of the nation was enshrined in the 1857 and was ratified in the current constitution of 1917 josé maría morelos noted in his writings that there should be no tolerance for any other religion and the constitution of 1824 declared that the official religion of the republic would be catholic and from the second half of the 20th century began a process of introducing creeds different from the catholic
the 1920s was marked by a religious conflict known as the cristero war in which many peasants encouraged by the clergy clashed with the federal government that had decided to enforce the constitutional laws of 1917 among the measures contemplated by the magna carta were the suppression of the monastic orders and the cancellation of all religious worship the war ended with an agreement between the parties in conflict catholic church and state by means of which the respective fields of action were defined until the middle of the 1990s the mexican constitution did not recognize the existence of any religious group in 1993 a law was enacted whereby the state granted them legal status as religious associations this fact allowed the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with the holy see to which the mexican state did not recognize as a political entity
according to the figures of inegi most mexicans declare themselves christian and most catholics almost 93 million adherents according to the census of 2010
the second christian group is the jehovahs witnesses which totals more than 1 million adherents making the mexican congregation of this christian branch the second worldwide thirdly find the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints whose members are known as mormons 2010 census reported 314,932 members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints though the church in 2009 claimed to have over one million registered members followed by church of the la luz del mundo which has its center in la hermosa provincia a colony of guadalajara the denominations pentecostal also have an important presence especially in the cities of the border and in the indigenous communities in fact pentecostal churches together have more than 1.3 million adherents which in net numbers place them as the second christian creed in mexico the situation changes when the different pentecostal denominations are considered as separate entities other groups are growing such as iglesia apostólica de la fe en cristo jesús mennonites and seventh-day adventist church migratory phenomena have led to the proliferation of different aspects of christianity including branches protestants eastern catholic churches and eastern orthodox church
according to jacobo grinberg-zylberbaum in texts edited by the national autonomous university of mexico it is remarkable the survival of magic-religious rituals of the old indigenous groups not only in the current indigenous people but in the mestizos and whites that make up the mexican rural and urban society there is often a syncretism between shamanism and the catholic tradition another religion of popular syncretism in mexico especially in recent years is the santería this is mainly due to the large number of cubans who settled in the territory after the cuban revolution mainly in states such as veracruz and yucatán although mexico was also a recipient of black slaves from africa in the 16th century the apogee of these cults is relatively newin certain regions the profession of a creed other than the catholic is seen as a threat to community unity it is argued that the catholic religion is part of the ethnic identity and that the protestants are not willing to participate in the traditional customs and practices the tequio or community work participation in the festivities and similar issues the refusal of the protestants is because their religious beliefs do not allow them to participate in the cult of images in extreme cases tension between catholics and protestants has led to the expulsion or even murder of protestants in several villages the best known cases are those of san juan chamula in chiapas and san nicolás in ixmiquilpan hidalgo

a similar argument was presented by a committee of anthropologists to request the government of the republic to expel the summer linguistic institute sil in the year 1979 which was accused of promoting the division of indigenous peoples by translating the bible into vernacular languages and evangelizing in a protestant creed that threatened the integrity of popular cultures the mexican government paid attention to the call of the anthropologists and canceled the agreement that had held with the sil conflicts have also occurred in other areas of social life for example given that jehovahs witnesses are prohibited from surrendering honors to national symbols something that is done every monday in mexican public schools children who have been educated in that religion were expelled from public schools this type of problem can only be solved with the intervention of the national commission of human rights and not always with favorable results for children
the impact of the catholic religion in mexico has also caused a fusion of elements beyond churches and religious denominations a phenomenon persists in mexico that some anthropologists and sociologists call popular religion that is religion as the practice and understanding of the people in mexico the main component is the catholic religion to which elements of other beliefs have been added already of pre-hispanic african or asian origin in general popular religiosity is viewed with bad eyes by institutionally structured religions one of the most exemplary cases of popular religiosity is the cult of holy dead santa muerte the catholic hierarchy insists on describing it as a satanic cult however most of the people who profess this cult declare themselves to be catholic believers and consider that there is no contradiction between the tributes they offer to the white child and the adoration of god other examples are the representations of the passion of christ and the celebration of day of the dead which take place within the framework of the catholic christian imaginary but under a very particular reinterpretation of its protagonists
the presence of jews in mexico dates back to 1521 when hernán cortés conquered the aztecs accompanied by several conversos  according to the 2010 census there are 67,476 jews in mexico islam in mexico is practiced mostly by arab mexicans in the 2010 census 18,185 mexicans reported belonging to an eastern religion a category which includes a tiny buddhist population


 women 

until the twentieth century mexico was an overwhelmingly rural country with rural womens status defined within the context of the family and local community  with urbanization beginning in the sixteenth century following the spanish conquest of the aztec empire cities have provided economic and social opportunities not possible within rural villages
as of  2014 mexico has the 16th highest rate of homicides committed against women in the world a study in 1997 showed that the prevalence of domestic violence against women in mexican marital relationships varies at between 30 and 60 percent of relationships the remains of the victims were frequently mutilated according to a 1997 study domestic abuse in mexican culture is embedded in gender and marital relations fostered in mexican womens dependence on their spouses for subsistence and for self-esteem sustained by ideologies of romantic love by family structure and residential arrangements the perpetrators are often the boyfriend father-in-law ex-husbands or husbands but only 1.6% of the murder cases led to an arrest and sentencing


 culture 

mexican culture reflects the complexity of the countrys history through the blending of indigenous cultures and the culture of spain imparted during spains 300-year occupation of mexico exogenous cultural elements have been incorporated into mexican culture as time has passed
the porfirian era el porfiriato in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century was marked by economic progress and peace after four decades of civil unrest and war mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts promoted by president díaz himself since that time as accentuated during the mexican revolution cultural identity has had its foundation in the mestizaje of which the indigenous ie amerindian element is the core in light of the various ethnicities that formed the mexican people josé vasconcelos in his publication la raza cósmica the cosmic race 1925 defined mexico to be the melting pot of all races thus extending the definition of the mestizo not only biologically but culturally as well


 painting 

the painting is one of the oldest arts in mexico the cave painting in mexican territory is about 7500 years old and has been manifested in the caves of the baja california peninsula pre-hispanic mexico is present in buildings and caves in aztec codices in ceramics in garments etc  examples of this are the maya mural paintings of bonampak or those of teotihuacán those of cacaxtla and those of monte albán
the mural painting had an important flowering during the 16th century the same in religious constructions as in houses of lineage such is the case of the convents of acolman actopan huejotzingo tecamachalco and zinacantepec it is said that they were mainly indigenous painters led by friars who made them these were also manifested in illustrated manuscripts such as the matrícula de tributos
for a time it was believed that the first european painter living in new spain was rodrigo de cifuentes an apocryphal artist who even came to be attributed works such as the baptism of the caciques de tlaxcala painting of the main altarpiece of the convent of san francisco in tlaxcala among the native painters was marcos aquino the religiosity of the novohispanos new-spanish made that the painting was important for the evangelization of the society the friars realized the graphic skills of the natives who enriched the baroque and mannerist style the arrival of several european painters and some students from new spain such as juan correa cristóbal de villalpando or miguel cabrera who made the walls and altarpieces the main source of ideological and political expression of artists
the painting of the 19th century had a very marked romantic influence landscapes and portraits were the greatest expression of this era hermenegildo bustos is one of the most appreciated painters of the historiography of mexican art they also emphasize in these years santiago rebull josé salomé pina félix parra eugenio landesio and his famous disciple the landscaper josé maría velasco gómez as well like julio ruelas
the mexican painting of the 20th century has achieved world renown with figures such as david alfaro siqueiros josé clemente orozco joaquín clausell frida kahlo and diego rivera generation of idealists who marked the image of modern mexico in the face of strong social and economic criticism the oaxacan school quickly gained fame and prestige diffusion of an ancestral and modern culture freedom of design is observed in relation to the color and texture of the canvases and murals as a period of transition between the 20th century and the 21st century
some of the most outstanding painters in the 21st century current painters patricia calvo guzmán she studied painting in beijing her work of marked oriental influence recalls the cut paper figures of mexico and china mixing them with a rich chromatic range eliseo garza aguilar painter and performer considered among the leading exponents of the provocative and reflective art of the third millennium in search of a critical response from the spectators he combines his pictorial work in the performances with theatrical histrionics pilar goutas a painter who uses oil on amate support with strong influence from jackson pollock and chinese calligraphy rafael torres correa settles his residence in mexico in 2001 and joins the contemporary art workshop la polilla in guadalajara and performs various plastic and scenographic projects
throughout history several prominent painters of different nationalities have expressed in their works the face of mexico among the most outstanding we can mention daniel thomas egerton carl nebel thomas moran édouard manet and leonora carrington


 sculpture 

sculpture in mexico is strongly manifested in mesoamerican pre-columbian cultures mayans olmecs toltecs mixtecs aztecs etc being this generally religious
from the spanish conquest civil and religious sculpture is worked by indigenous artists with guidance from teachers of the peninsula so some pre-hispanic features are shown since the 17th century white and mestizo sculptors have created works with a marked influence of european classicism
romanticism tended to break the strict norms and models of classicism as it pursued ideas influenced by realism and nationalism the religious sculpture was reduced to a sporadic imagery while the secular sculpture continued in portraits and monumental art of a civic nature between 1820 and 1880 the predominant themes were successively religious images biblical scenes allegories to the symbols of the insurgency movement and scenes and characters of pre-cortesian history and portraits of the old aristocracy of the nascent bourgeoisie and commanders of the pre-revolution the transcendent was to introduce civil reasons the first national types and glimpses of a current of self-expression
during the 20th century great exponents of mexican sculpture are juan soriano josé luis cuevas enrique carbajal sebastián english leonora carrington


 architecture 

the presence of the human being in the mexican territory has left important archaeological findings of great importance for the explanation of the habitat of primitive man and contemporary man the mesoamerican civilizations managed to have great stylistic development and proportion on the human and urban scale the form was evolving from simplicity to aesthetic complexity in the north of the country the adobe and stone architecture is manifested the multifamily housing as we can see in casas grandes and the troglodyte dwelling in caves of the sierra madre occidental
urbanism had a great development in pre-hispanic cultures where we can see the magnitude of the cities of teotihuacán tollan-xicocotitlan and méxico-tenochtitlan within the environmentalist urbanism highlight the mayan cities to be incorporated into the monumentality of its buildings with the thickness of the jungle and complex networks of roads called sakbés
with the arrival of the spaniards architectural theories of the greco-roman order with arab influences were introduced due to the process of evangelization when the first monastic temples and monasteries were built their own models were projected such as the mendicant monasteries unique in their type in architecture the interaction between spaniards and natives gave rise to artistic styles such as the so-called tequitqui from nahuatl worker years later the baroque and mannerism were imposed in large cathedrals and civil buildings while rural areas are built haciendas or stately farms with mozarabic tendencies
in the 19th century the neoclassical movement arose as a response to the objectives of the republican nation one of its examples are the hospicio cabañas where the strict plastic of the classical orders are represented in their architectural elements new religious buildings also arise civilian and military that demonstrate the presence of neoclassicism romanticists from a past seen through archeology show images of medieval europe islamic and pre-hispanic mexico in the form of architectural elements in the construction of international exhibition pavilions looking for an identity typical of the national culture the art nouveau and the art deco were styles introduced into the design of the palacio de bellas artes to mark the identity of the mexican nation with greek-roman and pre-hispanic symbols
modern architecture in mexico has an important development in the plasticity of form and space josé villagrán garcía develops a theory of form that sets the pattern of teaching in many schools of architecture in the country within functionalism the emergence of the new mexican architecture was born as a formal order of the policies of a nationalist state that sought modernity and the differentiation of other nations juan ogorman was one of the first environmental architects in mexico developing the organic theory trying to integrate the building with the landscape within the same approaches of frank lloyd wright in the search for a new architecture that does not resemble the styles of the past it achieves a joint manifestation with the mural painting and the landscaping
the jalisco school was a proposal of those socio-political movements that the country demanded luis barragán managed to combine the shape of the space with forms of rural vernacular architecture of mexico and mediterranean countries spain-morocco integrating an impressive color that handles light and shade in different tones and opens a look at the international minimalism
mexican architecture is a cultural phenomenon born of the ideology of nationalist governments of the 20th century which was shaping the identity image by its colorful and variegated ornamental elements inherited from ancestral cultures classical and monumental forms and subsequently the incorporation of modernism and cutting-edge international trends


 the mexican lo mexicano 
in ethnic and cultural terms lo mexicano corresponds only to everything that is referred to the aztec culture therefore ethnically mexicans are those who are also known as nahuas and whose language is nahuatl there is a strong discussion to define the mexican lo mexicano there are two completely divided aspects ethnic and cultural which focuses exclusively on the mesoamerican people called mexica people and the legal-administrative aspect of the territory called mexico in legal terms and in accordance with the constitution a mexican is a citizen born within the territory of the united mexican states or whoever has decided adopt the mexican citizenship
the mexican could be what characterizes the being of mexico and its people however it is an ethnic concept that only defines the mestizo identity that had been related for a long time and that is limited with respect to the ethnic diversity of the country it is an intellectual construction product of the approaches of specialists to the cultural reality of the country in trying to capture in a single figure the multicultural reality of mexico the result of the intellectual analysis has produced a series of stereotypes and truisms about what it is to be a mexican this discourse about the mexican has been used in the political field to legitimize power and at the same time it is imposed on the population of the country as a fact beyond all doubt
the intellectual construction of the mestizo is in dialogue with the triumph of revolutionary nationalism which was born after the mexican revolution in the reflection on the subject the character of the mexican the mexicanity the definition of a mexican have participated among others josé vasconcelos samuel ramos emilio uranga josé gaos leopoldo zea jorge portilla santiago ramírez salvador pérez nevares roger bartra josé del val arturo warman aniceto aramoni rogelio díaz guerrero ezequiel adeodato chávez lavista mauro rodríguez estrada and carlos chilpa navarrete in this specific topic occupies a privileged place octavio paz author of the labyrinth of solitude

other writers include alfonso reyes josé joaquín fernández de lizardi ignacio manuel altamirano carlos fuentes octavio paz nobel laureate renato leduc carlos monsiváis elena poniatowska mariano azuela los de abajo and juan rulfo pedro páramo bruno traven wrote canasta de cuentos mexicanos mexican tales basket el tesoro de la sierra madre treasure of the sierra madre


 visual arts 

post-revolutionary art in mexico had its expression in the works of renowned artists such as david alfaro siqueiros federico cantú garza frida kahlo juan ogorman josé clemente orozco diego rivera and rufino tamayo diego rivera the most well-known figure of mexican muralism painted the man at the crossroads at the rockefeller center in new york city a huge mural that was destroyed the next year because of the inclusion of a portrait of russian communist leader lenin some of riveras murals are displayed at the mexican national palace and the palace of fine arts
mesoamerican architecture is mostly noted for its pyramids which are the largest such structures outside of ancient egypt spanish colonial architecture is marked by the contrast between the simple solid construction demanded by the new environment and the baroque ornamentation exported from spain mexico as the center of new spain has some of the most renowned buildings built in this style


 cinema 

mexican films from the golden age in the 1940s and 1950s are the greatest examples of latin american cinema with a huge industry comparable to the hollywood of those years mexican films were exported and exhibited in all of latin america and europe maria candelaria 1943 by emilio fernández was one of the first films awarded a palme dor at the cannes film festival in 1946 the first time the event was held after world war ii the famous spanish-born director luis buñuel realized in mexico between 1947 and 1965 some of his masterpieces like los olvidados 1949 and viridiana 1961 famous actors and actresses from this period include maría félix pedro infante dolores del río jorge negrete and the comedian cantinflas

 cuisine 

in 2005 mexico presented the candidature of its gastronomy for world heritage site of unesco being the first occasion in which a country had presented its gastronomic tradition for this purpose however in a first instance the result was negative because the committee did not place the proper emphasis on the importance of corn in mexican cuisine finally on november 16 2010 mexican gastronomy was recognized as intangible cultural heritage by unescothe origin of the current mexican cuisine is established during the spanish colonization being a mixture of the foods of spain with native indigenous ingredients of foods originated in mexico is the corn the pepper vegetables together with central and south america calabazas together with the americas avocados sweet potato together with central and south america the turkey together with the americas and other fruits and spices other indigenous products are many beans similarly some cooking techniques used today are inherited from pre-hispanic peoples such as the nixtamalization of corn the cooking of food in ovens at ground level grinding in molcajete and metate with the spaniards came the pork beef and chicken meats peppercorn sugar milk and all its derivatives wheat and rice citrus fruits and another constellation of ingredients that are part of the daily diet of mexicans

 coat of arms 

the current coat of arms of mexico spanish escudo nacional de méxico literally national shield of mexico has been an important symbol of politics and culture of mexico for centuries it depicts a mexican golden eagle perched on a prickly pear cactus devouring a rattlesnake the design is rooted in the legend that the aztec people would know where to build their city once they saw an eagle eating a snake on top of a lake to the people of tenochtitlan this symbol had strong religious connotations and to the europeans it came to symbolize the triumph of good over evil with the snake sometimes representative of the serpent in the garden of eden
