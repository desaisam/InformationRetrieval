over the last four thousand years chinese imperialism and expansion has been a central feature of the history of east asia since the recovery of chinese strength in the  late 20th century the issues involved  have been of concern to chinas neighbors to the east


 early chinese expansions 
in ancient chinese political theory relations between foreign states were governed by the tributary system since the emperor of china held the mandate of heaven his rule was universal and extended to all under heaven sometimes neighboring states were actual protectorates or vassal states over which china exerted large amounts of influence while in other cases foreign states merely acknowledged chinas nominal suzerainty in order to gain access to chinese trade which took place through the tributary systemthe king of the ancient state of qin first unified the chinese empire in 221 bc by conquering all of the other states in what was then considered china and proclaimed himself the first emperor and became known as qin shi huangdithe ancient han dynasty 202 bc – 220 ad established control over northern vietnam northern korea and the tarim basin of central asia the short-lived sui dynasty 581–618 ad reinvaded annam northern vietnam and attacked champa southern vietnam while they also attempted to conquer korea which failed see goguryeo-sui warsthe later tang dynasty 618–907 aided the korean silla kingdom in defeating their two korean rivals yet became shortchanged when they discovered silla was not about to allow the tang to claim much of goguryeos territory as it had been under the chinese han dynastys control a few centuries before the han having wrested it from native kingdoms at that time the tang dynasty established control over the tarim basin region as well fighting wars with the new tibetan empire and stripping them of their colonies in central asia which was abandoned after the an lushan rebellion the song dynasty 960–1279 in securing maritime trade routes that ran from south east asia into the indian ocean had established fortified trade bases in the philippines the mongol-led yuan dynasty 1279–1368 made attempts to invade japan after securing the korean peninsula through the vassaldom of the korean goryeo dynasty yet both of these military ventures failed see mongol invasions of japan


 qing territorial expansion 

by the late 19th century in response to competition with other states the qing government of china attempted to exert direct control of its frontier areas by conquest or if already under military control conversion into provinces
ming-dynasty loyalists from china invaded taiwan and expelled dutch colonialists from the island during the siege of fort zeelandia and founded the chinese kingdom of tungning the ming loyalists quickly moved to replace the institutions and culture of dutch colonial rule with han chinese colonial rule language and religious institutions left by the dutch were closed and replaced with confucian temples and chinese language schools for both han chinese and aboriginals officials encouraged new immigration of han chinese from china into territory further inland turning aboriginal lands into new farmland after fighting between the ming loyalists and the qing during the revolt of the three feudatories the qing attacked the kingdom of tungning the qing won the battle of penghu and the ming loyalists submitted to qing rule tungning was annexed as part of fujian province the qing were reluctant colonizers but became convinced of taiwans value to their empire due to the threat the island posed if used as a base by rival powers and by its abundant resources  the qing turned taiwan into its own province in 1885 after japanese interest and a defeated french invasion attempt
after british troops invaded tibet in the waning days of the qing dynasty the qing responded by sending zhao erfeng to further integrate tibet into china  he succeeded in abolishing the powers of the tibetan local leaders in kham and appointing chinese magistrates in their places by 1909–10 qing forces were also sent to ü-tsang in 1910 to establish a direct control over tibet proper though a province was never established in this area


 process of expansion 
the ability of qing china to project power into central asia came about because of two changes one social and one technological  the social change was that under the qing dynasty from 1642 china came under the control of the manchus who organised their military forces around cavalry which was more suited for power projection than traditional chinese infantry  the technological change was advances in artillery which negated the military advantage that the people of the steppe had with their cavalry zunghar khanate зүүн гарын хаант улс was the last great independent nomadic power on the steppe in central asia the dzungars were deliberately exterminated in a brutal campaign during the zunghar genocide by manchu bannermen and khalkha mongols it has been estimated that more than a million people were slaughtered and it took generations for it to recover  the manchu ruling family aisin gioro was a supporter of tibetan buddhism and so many of the ruling groups were linked by religion


 burma myanmar 
the qing campaign against burma myanmar 1765-70 was its most disastrous and costly frontier war it ended in a stalemate but the qing rulers could not accept burma as an equal and when diplomatic relations were resumed in 1790 the qing court considered this was a restoration of chinese suzerainty


 recent tensions 

with the 1978 chinese economic reform launched by deng xiaoping china has increased its political stance its influence and its power abroad on one side china remains deeply neutral and not involving in any conflict and the land borders are stable  china has increased its influence while using military and economic wealth and claims to island territories that have caused anxiety in neighbors to the east such as the philippines and japan 
jeffrey  reeves 2018  argues that since 2012 the xi administration has demonstrated a concerted imperialist policy towards its developing neighbor states to the south and west especially mongolia kazakhstan tajikistan kyrgyzstan afghanistan pakistan nepal myanmar cambodia lao pdr and vietnam
