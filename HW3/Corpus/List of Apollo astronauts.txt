thirty-two astronauts were assigned to fly in the apollo manned lunar landing program twenty-four of them flying on nine different missions reached an orbit around the moon of the other manned missions apollo 1 did not launch and apollo 7 and apollo 9 were low earth orbit spacecraft testing missions in addition nine astronauts flew apollo spacecraft in the apollo applications programs skylab and apollo–soyuz test project
twelve of these astronauts walked on the moons surface and six of those drove lunar roving vehicles on the moon while three astronauts flew to the moon twice of which  two landed none landed on the moon more than once the nine apollo missions to the moon occurred between december 1968 and december 1972
apart from these twenty-four men who visited the moon no human being has gone beyond low earth orbit they have therefore been farther from the earth than anyone else they are also the only people to have directly viewed the far side of the moon the twelve who walked on the moon are the only people ever to have set foot on an astronomical object other than the earth
of the twenty-four astronauts who flew to the moon two went on to command a skylab mission one commanded apollo–soyuz one flew as commander for approach and landing tests of the space shuttle and two went on to command orbital space shuttle missions a total of twenty-four nasa astronauts from the apollo era flew on the space shuttle


 prime crew members 
nasas director of flight crew operations during the gemini and apollo programs was donald k deke slayton one of the original mercury seven astronauts who was medically grounded in september 1962 due to a minor cardiac arrythmia – paroxysmal atrial fibrillation slayton was responsible for making all gemini and apollo crew assignments in march 1972 slayton was restored to flight status and flew on the 1975 apollo–soyuz test project mission
the prime crew members selected for actual missions are here grouped by their nasa astronaut selection groups and within each group in the order selected for flight two versions of the apollo commandservice module csm spacecraft were developed block i intended for preliminary low earth orbit testing and block ii which was designed for the lunar landing the block i crew position titles were command pilot senior pilot second seat and pilot third seat  the corresponding block ii titles were commander command module pilot second seat and lunar module pilot third seat the second seat pilot was given secondary responsibility for celestial navigation to keep the csms guidance computer accurately calibrated with the spacecrafts true position and the third seat pilot served as a flight engineer monitoring the health of the spacecraft systems


 from the mercury seven 

virgil i gus grissom – pilot of liberty bell 7 and commander of the first manned gemini 3 grissom was selected in 1966 as command pilot for the first manned mission apollo 1 a low earth orbit test of the block i commandservice module this mission ended a month before its scheduled launch when a cabin fire on the launch pad killed grissom and his entire crew—ed white and roger chaffee—on january 27 1967 according to slayton grissom would have been his choice to be the first to walk on the moon
walter m schirra jr – pilot of sigma 7 and commander of gemini 6a was selected to command a second csm test flight which was canceled in late 1966 at which time he was reassigned as grissoms backup twenty-one months after the apollo 1 fire schirra commanded the first block ii csm test flight apollo 7 he was the only member of the mercury seven to fly on all three programs
alan b shepard jr – americas first man in space on freedom 7 was originally selected to command gemini 3 but was medically grounded for the duration of gemini due to ménières disease and assisted slayton in flight operations after corrective surgery shepard was restored to flight status and commanded apollo 14 the third successful moon landing mission

 from astronaut group 4 

in june 1965 nasa named a group of five scientist astronauts the first group qualified by doctorate degrees rather than test or military fighter pilot experience  geologist harrison h jack schmitt participated heavily in the geological training of the lunar landing astronauts as well as assisting in the analysis of returned samples and the preparation of mission reports in 1970 he was selected as lunar module pilot for the apollo 15 backup crew and prime crew on apollo 18 when program cutbacks canceled missions 18 through 20 nasas lunar geological community insisted on having a geologist on the moon so slayton reassigned schmitt to apollo 17


 from astronaut group 5 

nasa named a group of 19 more astronauts in april 1966  none had spaceflight experience before their apollo mission

t kenneth mattingly ii – selected as prime command module pilot for apollo 13 mattingly was exposed to german measles days before the flight and was grounded by the flight surgeon though ultimately did not contract the disease he swapped places with his backup and flew on apollo 16  he also flew on sts-4 and sts-51-c
john l jack swigert jr – flew as mattinglys backup on apollo 13
fred w haise jr – flew as lunar module pilot on the unsuccessful apollo 13 haise was selected to command the apollo 19 lunar landing which was canceled haise would later be named commander of the first crew for the space shuttles approach and landing tests using the prototype space shuttle enterprise
stuart a roosa – command module pilot on apollo 14
edgar d mitchell – lunar module pilot on apollo 14
alfred m worden – command module pilot on apollo 15
james b irwin – lunar module pilot on apollo 15

clifton c williams jr – from group 3 was named as schweickarts lunar module pilot backup crew but was killed when the t-38 jet he was flying crashed near tallahassee florida on october 5 1967 he was replaced with bean who flew on apollo 12
edward g givens jr – from group 5 was on the support crew of apollo 7 but died in a car crash near houston texas on june 6 1967
joseph h engle – from group 5 was originally named as apollo 17 lunar module pilot but lost his slot to schmitt after apollo he flew in the space shuttle approach and landing tests then commanded sts-2 and sts-51i


 apollo astronauts who walked on the moon 

twelve people have walked on the moon four of them are still living as of  march 2019 all manned lunar landings took place between july 1969 and december 1972 as part of the apollo program most astronauts at that time came from the military services and were considered to be on active duty during their nasa service the few exceptions were considered civilian nasa astronauts regardless of any prior military service

on each of the apollo 17 extravehicular activities evas harrison schmitt was the second person out of and the first person back into the apollo lunar module schmitt is thus the 12th and last person to have stepped onto the moon eugene cernan as the second person to enter the lunar module on the final eva was the last person to have walked on the moon
alan shepard was the oldest person to walk on the moon at age 47 years and 80 days charlie duke was the youngest at age 36 years and 201 days
jim lovell and fred haise were scheduled to walk on the moon during the apollo 13 mission but the lunar landing was aborted following a major malfunction en route to the moon haise was again scheduled to walk on the moon as commander of apollo 19 but apollo 18 and apollo 19 were canceled on september 2 1970
joe engle had trained on the backup crew for apollo 14 to explore the moon with cernan but engle was replaced by schmitt on the primary crew for apollo 17 schmitt had previously been crewed with apollo 12 command module pilot dick gordon in anticipation of apollo 18 but schmitt replaced engle on apollo 17 after the cancellation of apollo 18 and apollo 19 leaving gordon as the last apollo astronaut to train extensively for lunar exploration without ever landing on the moon


 apollo astronauts who flew to the moon without landing 
besides the 12 people who have walked on the moon 12 more have flown to within 0.001 lunar distance of its surface during each of the six missions with successful lunar landings one astronaut remained in lunar orbit while the other two landed in addition the three-person crews of apollo 8 and apollo 10 also entered lunar orbit and the crew of apollo 13 looped around the moon on a free-return trajectory
all nine manned missions to the moon took place as part of the apollo program over a period of just under four years from 21 december 1968 to 19 december 1972 the 24 people who have flown to the moon are the only people who have traveled beyond low earth orbit twelve of them are still living as of  march 2019
jim lovell john young and eugene cernan are the only three people to have flown to the moon twice young and cernan each set foot on it during their respective second lunar missions while lovell is the only person to have flown to the moon twice without landing
during cernans first lunar mission on apollo 10 he tied the present record set by bill anders on apollo 8 as the youngest person to fly to the moon each was 35 years and 65 days old on his launch date and 35 years and 68 days old when he entered lunar orbit the oldest person to fly to the moon was alan shepard who walked on its surface during the apollo 14 mission shepard was 47 years and 74 days old on his launch date and 47 years and 78 days old when he entered lunar orbit
because of apollo 13s free-return trajectory lovell jack swigert and fred haise flew higher above the moons 180° meridian opposite earth than anyone else has flown 254 km158 mi coincidentally due to the moons distance from earth at the time they simultaneously set the present record for humans greatest distance from earth reaching an altitude of 400,171 km 248,655 mi above sea level at 021 utc on 15 april 1970
