 history 
during the early years of spaceflight only nation states had the resources to develop and fly spacecraft both the us space program and soviet space program were operated using mainly military pilots as astronauts during this period no commercial space launches were available to private operators and no private organization was able to offer space launches
in the 1980s the european space agency created arianespace the worlds first commercial space transportation company and following the challenger disaster the american government deregulated the american space transportation market as well in the 1990s the russian government sold their majority stake in rsc energia to private investors although it has recently renationalized the russian space sector in 2013â€“2014 
these events for the first time allowed private organizations to purchase develop and offer space launch services beginning the period of private spaceflight in the late-1980s and early-1990s
