many parts of the outer solar system have been considered for possible future colonization most of the larger moons of the outer planets contain water ice liquid water and organic compounds that might be useful for sustaining human lifecolonies in the outer solar system could also serve as centers for long-term investigation of the planet and the other moons in particular robotic devices could be controlled by humans without the very long time delays incurred in communicating with earth
there have also been proposals to place robotic aerostats in the upper atmospheres of the solar systems gas giant planets for exploration and possibly mining of helium-3 which could have a very high value per unit mass as a thermonuclear fuel


 the jovian system 
 

the jovian system in general has particular disadvantages for colonization including its severe radiation environment and its particularly deep gravity well its radiation would deliver about 3,600 rems per day to unshielded colonists on io and about 540 rems per day to unshielded colonists on europa exposure to about 75 rems over a few days is enough to cause radiation poisoning and about 500 rems over a few days is fataljupiter itself like the other gas giants is not generally considered a good candidate for colonization there is no accessible surface on which to land and the light hydrogen atmosphere would not provide good buoyancy for some kind of aerial habitat as has been proposed for venus


 io 
io is not ideal for colonization due to its hostile environment the moon is under influence of high tidal forces causing high volcanic activity on the moon jupiters strong radiation belt overshadows io delivering 3,600 rem a day to the moon the moon is also extremely dry io is the least ideal place for colonization of the four galilean moons
despite this its volcanoes could be energy resources for the other moons better to colonize


 europa 

the artemis project proposed a plan to colonize europa scientists would inhabit igloos and drill down into the europan ice crust exploring any subsurface ocean the report also discusses use of air pockets for human habitation


 ganymede 
ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system ganymede is the only moon with a magnetosphere but it is overshadowed by jupiters magnetic field ganymede receives about 8 rem of radiation per day


 callisto 

due to its distance from jupiters powerful radiation belt callisto is subject to only 0.01 rem a day when nasa carried out a study called hope revolutionary concepts for human outer planet exploration regarding the future exploration of the solar system the target chosen was callisto it might be possible to build a surface base that would produce fuel for further exploration of the solar system


 jupiter trojans 
the keck observatory announced in 2006 that the binary jupiter trojan 617 patroclus and possibly many other jupiter trojans are likely composed of water ice with a layer of dust this suggests that mining water and other volatiles in this region and transporting them elsewhere in the solar system perhaps via the proposed interplanetary transport network may be feasible in the not-so-distant future this could make colonization of the moon mercury and main-belt asteroids more practical


 the saturnian system 
robert zubrin identified saturn uranus and neptune as the persian gulf of the solar system as the largest sources of deuterium and helium-3 to drive a fusion economy with saturn the most important and most valuable of the three because of its relative proximity low radiation and excellent system of moons


 titan 
 
zubrin identified titan as possessing an abundance of all the elements necessary to support life making titan perhaps the most advantageous locale in the outer solar system for colonization he said in certain ways titan is the most hospitable extraterrestrial world within the solar system for human colonization a widely published expert on terraforming christopher mckay is also a co-investigator on the huygens probe that landed on titan in january 2005
the surface of titan is mostly uncratered and thus inferred to be very young and active and probably composed of mostly water ice and lakes of liquid hydrocarbons methaneethane in its polar regions while the temperature is cryogenic 95 k it should be able to support a base but more information regarding titans surface and the activities on it is necessary the thick atmosphere and the weather such as potential flash floods are also factors to consider


 enceladus 
on march 9 2006 nasas cassini space probe found possible evidence of liquid water on enceladus according to that article pockets of liquid water may be no more than tens of meters below the surface these findings were confirmed in 2014 by nasa this means liquid water could be collected much more easily and safely on enceladus than for instance on europa see above discovery of water especially liquid water generally makes a celestial body a much more likely candidate for colonization an alternative model of enceladus activity is the decomposition of methanewater clathrates â€“ a process requiring lower temperatures than liquid water eruptions the higher density of enceladus indicates a larger than saturnian average silicate core that could provide materials for base operations


 uranus 
because uranus has the lowest escape velocity of the four gas giants it  has been proposed as a mining site for helium-3 if human supervision of the robotic activity proved necessary one of uranuss natural satellites might serve as a base


 neptune 
it is hypothesized that one of neptunes satellites could  be used for colonization tritons surface shows signs of extensive geological activity that implies a subsurface ocean perhaps composed of ammoniawater if technology advanced to the point that tapping such geothermal energy was possible it could make colonizing a cryogenic world like triton feasible supplemented by nuclear fusion power


 kuiper belt and oort cloud 

the noted physicist freeman dyson identified comets rather than planets as the major potential habitat of life in space


 difficulties 
there would be many problems in colonizing the outer solar system these include

distance from earth the outer planets are much farther from earth than the inner planets and would therefore be harder and more time-consuming to reach in addition return voyages may well be prohibitive considering the time and distance
extreme cold temperatures are near absolute zero in many parts of the outer solar system
power solar power is many times less concentrated in the outer solar system than in the inner solar system it is unclear as to whether it would be usable there using some form of concentration mirrors or whether nuclear power would be necessary there have also been proposals to use the gravitational potential energy of planets or dwarf planets with moons
