 history 


 prehistory and early history 

the earliest evidence of the presence of human ancestors in the southern balkans dated to 270,000 bc is to be found in the petralona cave in the greek province of macedonia all three stages of the stone age paleolithic mesolithic and neolithic are represented in greece for example in the franchthi cave neolithic settlements in greece dating from the 7th millennium bc are the oldest in europe by several centuries as greece lies on the route via which farming spread from the near east to europe

greece is home to the first advanced civilizations in europe and is considered the birthplace of western civilisation beginning with the cycladic civilization on the islands of the aegean sea at around 3200 bc the minoan civilization in crete 2700–1500 bc and then the mycenaean civilization on the mainland 1900–1100 bc these civilizations possessed writing the minoans writing in an undeciphered script known as linear a and the mycenaeans in linear b an early form of greek the mycenaeans gradually absorbed the minoans but collapsed violently around 1200 bc during a time of regional upheaval known as the bronze age collapse this ushered in a period known as the greek dark ages from which written records are absent though the unearthed linear b texts are too fragmentary for the reconstruction of the political landscape and cant support the existence of a larger state contemporary hittite and egyptian records suggest the presence of a single state under a great king based in mainland greece


 archaic and classical period 

the end of the dark ages is traditionally dated to 776 bc the year of the first olympic games the iliad and the odyssey the foundational texts of western literature are believed to have been composed by homer in the 7th or 8th centuries bc with the end of the dark ages there emerged various kingdoms and city-states across the greek peninsula which spread to the shores of the black sea southern italy magna graecia and asia minor these states and their colonies reached great levels of prosperity that resulted in an unprecedented cultural boom that of classical greece expressed in architecture drama science mathematics and philosophy in 508 bc cleisthenes instituted the worlds first democratic system of government in athens

by 500 bc the persian empire controlled the greek city states in asia minor and macedonia attempts by some of the greek city-states of asia minor to overthrow persian rule failed and persia invaded the states of mainland greece in 492 bc but was forced to withdraw after a defeat at the battle of marathon in 490 bc in response the greek city-states formed the hellenic league in 481 bc led by sparta which was the first historically recorded union of greek states since the mythical union of the trojan war a second invasion by the persians followed in 480 bc following decisive greek victories in 480 and 479 bc at salamis plataea and mycale the persians were forced to withdraw for a second time marking their eventual withdrawal from all of their european territories led by athens and sparta the greek victories in the greco-persian wars are considered a pivotal moment in world history as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as the golden age of athens the seminal period of ancient greek development that laid many of the foundations of western civilization

lack of political unity within greece resulted in frequent conflict between greek states the most devastating intra-greek war was the peloponnesian war 431–404 bc won by sparta and marking the demise of the athenian empire as the leading power in ancient greece both athens and sparta were later overshadowed by thebes and eventually macedon with the latter uniting most of the city-states of the greek hinterland in the league of corinth also known as the hellenic league or greek league under the control of phillip ii despite this development the greek world remained largely fragmented and would not be united under a single power until the roman years sparta did not join the league and actively fought against it raising an army led by agis iii to secure the city-states of crete for persia

following the assassination of phillip ii his son alexander iii the great assumed the leadership of the league of corinth and launched an invasion of the persian empire with the combined forces of the league in 334 bc undefeated in battle alexander had conquered the persian empire in its entirety by 330 bc by the time of his death in 323 bc he had created one of the largest empires in history stretching from greece to india his empire split into several kingdoms upon his death the most famous of which were the seleucid empire ptolemaic egypt the greco-bactrian kingdom and the indo-greek kingdom many greeks migrated to alexandria antioch seleucia and the many other new hellenistic cities in asia and africa although the political unity of alexanders empire could not be maintained it resulted in the hellenistic civilization and spread the greek language and greek culture in the territories conquered by alexander greek science technology and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the hellenistic period


 hellenistic and roman periods 323 bc – 4th century ad 

after a period of confusion following alexanders death the antigonid dynasty descended from one of alexanders generals established its control over macedon and most of the greek city-states by 276 bc from about 200 bc the roman republic became increasingly involved in greek affairs and engaged in a series of wars with macedon macedons defeat at the battle of pydna in 168 bc signalled the end of antigonid power in greece in 146 bc macedonia was annexed as a province by rome and the rest of greece became a roman protectoratethe process was completed in 27 bc when the roman emperor augustus annexed the rest of greece and constituted it as the senatorial province of achaea despite their military superiority the romans admired and became heavily influenced by the achievements of greek culture hence horaces famous statement graecia capta ferum victorem cepit greece although captured took its wild conqueror captive the epics of homer inspired the aeneid of virgil and authors such as seneca the younger wrote using greek styles roman heroes such as scipio africanus tended to study philosophy and regarded greek culture and science as an example to be followed similarly most roman emperors maintained an admiration for things greek in nature the roman emperor nero visited greece in ad 66 and performed at the ancient olympic games despite the rules against non-greek participation hadrian was also particularly fond of the greeks before becoming emperor he served as an eponymous archon of athens

greek-speaking communities of the hellenised east were instrumental in the spread of early christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries and christianitys early leaders and writers notably st paul were mostly greek-speaking though generally not from greece itself the new testament was written in greek and some of its sections corinthians thessalonians philippians revelation of st john of patmos attest to the importance of churches in greece in early christianity nevertheless much of greece clung tenaciously to paganism and ancient greek religious practices were still in vogue in the late 4th century ad when they were outlawed by the roman emperor theodosius i in 391–392 the last recorded olympic games were held in 393 and many temples were destroyed or damaged in the century that followed in athens and rural areas paganism is attested well into the sixth century ad and even later the closure of the neoplatonic academy of athens by the emperor justinian in 529 is considered by many to mark the end of antiquity although there is evidence that the academy continued its activities for some time after that some remote areas such as the southeastern peloponnese remained pagan until well into the 10th century ad


 medieval period 4th – 15th century 

the roman empire in the east following the fall of the empire in the west in the 5th century is conventionally known as the byzantine empire but was simply called roman empire in its own time and lasted until 1453 with its capital in constantinople its language and literary culture was greek and its religion was predominantly eastern orthodox christianfrom the 4th century the empires balkan territories including greece suffered from the dislocation of barbarian invasions the raids and devastation of the goths and huns in the 4th and 5th centuries and the slavic invasion of greece in the 7th century resulted in a dramatic collapse in imperial authority in the greek peninsula following the slavic invasion the imperial government retained formal control of only the islands and coastal areas particularly the densely populated walled cities such as athens corinth and thessalonica while some mountainous areas in the interior held out on their own and continued to recognize imperial authority outside of these areas a limited amount of slavic settlement is generally thought to have occurred although on a much smaller scale than previously thought however the view that greece in late antiquity underwent a crisis of decline fragmentation and depopulation is now considered outdated as greek cities show a high degree of institutional continuity and prosperity between the 4th and 6th centuries ad and possibly later as well in the early 6th century greece had approximately 80 cities according to the synecdemus chronicle and the period from the 4th to the 7th century ad is considered one of high prosperity not just in greece but in the entire eastern mediterranean

until the 8th century almost all of modern greece was under the jurisdiction of the holy see of rome according to the system of pentarchy byzantine emperor leo iii moved the border of the patriarchate of constantinople westward and northward in the 8th centurythe byzantine recovery of lost provinces began toward the end of the 8th century and most of the greek peninsula came under imperial control again in stages during the 9th century this process was facilitated by a large influx of greeks from sicily and asia minor to the greek peninsula while at the same time many slavs were captured and re-settled in asia minor and the few that remained were assimilated during the 11th and 12th centuries the return of stability resulted in the greek peninsula benefiting from strong economic growth – much stronger than that of the anatolian territories of the empire during that time the greek orthodox church was also instrumental in the spread of greek ideas to the wider orthodox world

following the fourth crusade and the fall of constantinople to the latins in 1204 mainland greece was split between the greek despotate of epirus a byzantine successor state and french rule known as the frankokratia while some islands came under venetian rule the re-establishment of the byzantine imperial capital in constantinople in 1261 was accompanied by the empires recovery of much of the greek peninsula although the frankish principality of achaea in the peloponnese and the rival greek despotate of epirus in the north both remained important regional powers into the 14th century while the islands remained largely under genoese and venetian control during the paleologi dynasty 1261–1453 a new era of greek patriotism emerged accompanied by a turning back to ancient greeceas such prominent personalities at the time also proposed changing the imperial title to emperor of the hellenes and in late fourteenth century the emperor was frequently referred to as the emperor of the hellenes similarly in several international treaties of that time the byzantine emperor is styled as imperator graecorumin the 14th century much of the greek peninsula was lost by the byzantine empire at first to the serbs and then to the ottomans by the beginning of the 15th century the ottoman advance meant that byzantine territory in greece was limited mainly to its then-largest city thessaloniki and the peloponnese despotate of the morea after the fall of constantinople to the ottomans in 1453 the morea was one of the last remnants of the byzantine empire to hold out against the ottomans however this too fell to the ottomans in 1460 completing the ottoman conquest of mainland greece with the turkish conquest many byzantine greek scholars who up until then were largely responsible for preserving classical greek knowledge fled to the west taking with them a large body of literature and thereby significantly contributing to the renaissance


 venetian possessions and ottoman rule 15th century – 1821 

while most of mainland greece and the aegean islands was under ottoman control by the end of the 15th century cyprus and crete remained venetian territory and did not fall to the ottomans until 1571 and 1670 respectively the only part of the greek-speaking world that escaped long-term ottoman rule was the ionian islands which remained venetian until their capture by the first french republic in 1797 then passed to the united kingdom in 1809 until their unification with greece in 1864while some greeks in the ionian islands and constantinople lived in prosperity and greeks of constantinople phanariotes achieved positions of power within the ottoman administration much of the population of mainland greece suffered the economic consequences of the ottoman conquest heavy taxes were enforced and in later years the ottoman empire enacted a policy of creation of hereditary estates effectively turning the rural greek populations into serfsthe greek orthodox church and the ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople were considered by the ottoman governments as the ruling authorities of the entire orthodox christian population of the ottoman empire whether ethnically greek or not although the ottoman state did not force non-muslims to convert to islam christians faced several types of discrimination intended to highlight their inferior status in the ottoman empire discrimination against christians particularly when combined with harsh treatment by local ottoman authorities led to conversions to islam if only superficially in the 19th century many crypto-christians returned to their old religious allegiance

the nature of ottoman administration of greece varied though it was invariably arbitrary and often harsh some cities had governors appointed by the sultan while others like athens were self-governed municipalities mountainous regions in the interior and many islands remained effectively autonomous from the central ottoman state for many centurieswhen military conflicts broke out between the ottoman empire and other states greeks usually took up arms against the ottomans with few exceptions prior to the greek revolution of 1821 there had been a number of wars which saw greeks fight against the ottomans such as the greek participation in the battle of lepanto in 1571 the epirus peasants revolts of 1600–1601 led by the orthodox bishop dionysios skylosophos the morean war of 1684–1699 and the russian-instigated orlov revolt in 1770 which aimed at breaking up the ottoman empire in favor of russian interests these uprisings were put down by the ottomans with great bloodshed on the other side many greeks were conscripted as ottoman citizens to serve in the ottoman army and especially the ottoman navy while also the ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople responsible for the orthodox remained in general loyal to the empire
the 16th and 17th centuries are regarded as something of a dark age in greek history with the prospect of overthrowing ottoman rule appearing remote with only the ionian islands remaining free of turkish domination corfu withstood three major sieges in 1537 1571 and 1716 all of which resulted in the repulsion of the ottomans however in the 18th century due to their mastery of shipping and commerce a wealthy and dispersed greek merchant class arose these merchants came to dominate trade within the ottoman empire establishing communities throughout the mediterranean the balkans and western europe though the ottoman conquest had cut greece off from significant european intellectual movements such as the reformation and the enlightenment these ideas together with the ideals of the french revolution and romantic nationalism began to penetrate the greek world via the mercantile diaspora in the late 18th century rigas feraios the first revolutionary to envision an independent greek state published a series of documents relating to greek independence including but not limited to a national anthem and the first detailed map of greece in vienna and was murdered by ottoman agents in 1798


 modern period 


 greek war of independence 1821–1832 

in the late eighteenth century an increase in secular learning during the modern greek enlightenment led to the revival among greeks of the diaspora of the notion of a greek nation tracing its existence to ancient greece distinct from the other orthodox peoples and having a right to political autonomy one of the organizations formed in this intellectual milieu was the filiki eteria a secret organization formed by merchants in odessa in 1814 appropriating a long-standing tradition of orthodox messianic prophecy aspiring to the resurrection of the eastern roman empire and creating the impression they had the backing of tsarist russia they managed amidst a crisis of ottoman trade from 1815 onwards to engage traditional strata of the greek orthodox world in their liberal nationalist cause the filiki eteria planned to launch revolution in the peloponnese the danubian principalities and constantinople the first of these revolts began on 6 march 1821 in the danubian principalities under the leadership of alexandros ypsilantis but it was soon put down by the ottomans the events in the north spurred the greeks of the peloponnese into action and on 17 march 1821 the maniots declared war on the ottomansby the end of the month the peloponnese was in open revolt against the ottomans and by october 1821 the greeks under theodoros kolokotronis had captured tripolitsa the peloponnesian revolt was quickly followed by revolts in crete macedonia and central greece which would soon be suppressed meanwhile the makeshift greek navy was achieving success against the ottoman navy in the aegean sea and prevented ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea in 1822 and 1824 the turks and egyptians ravaged the islands including chios and psara committing wholesale massacres of the population approximately three-quarters of the chios greek population of 120,000 were killed enslaved or died of disease this had the effect of galvanizing public opinion in western europe in favor of the greek rebelstensions soon developed among different greek factions leading to two consecutive civil wars meanwhile the ottoman sultan negotiated with mehmet ali of egypt who agreed to send his son ibrahim pasha to greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gain ibrahim landed in the peloponnese in february 1825 and had immediate success by the end of 1825 most of the peloponnese was under egyptian control and the city of missolonghi—put under siege by the turks since april 1825—fell in april 1826 although ibrahim was defeated in mani he had succeeded in suppressing most of the revolt in the peloponnese and athens had been retaken
after years of negotiation three great powers france russian empire and the united kingdom decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to greece following news that combined ottoman–egyptian fleets were going to attack the greek island of hydra the allied fleet intercepted the ottoman–egyptian fleet at navarino a week-long standoff ended with the battle of navarino which resulted in the destruction of the ottoman–egyptian fleet a french expeditionary force was dispatched to supervise the evacuation of the egyptian army from the peloponnese while the greeks proceeded to the captured part of central greece by 1828 as a result of years of negotiation the nascent greek state was finally recognised under the london protocol in 1830


 kingdom of greece 

in 1827 ioannis kapodistrias from corfu was chosen by the third national assembly at troezen as the first governor of the first hellenic republic kapodistrias established a series of state economic and military institutions soon tensions appeared between him and local interests following his assassination in 1831 and the subsequent london conference a year later the great powers of britain france and russia installed bavarian prince otto von wittelsbach as monarch ottos reign was despotic and in its first 11 years of independence greece was ruled by a bavarian oligarchy led by joseph ludwig von armansperg as prime minister and later by otto himself who held the title of both king and premier throughout this period greece remained under the influence of its three protecting great powers france russia and the united kingdom as well as bavaria in 1843 an uprising forced the king to grant a constitution and a representative assembly
despite the absolutism of ottos reign the early years proved instrumental in creating institutions  which are still the bedrock of greek administration and education important steps were taken in the creation of the education system maritime and postal communications effective civil administration and most importantly the legal code historical revisionism took the form of de-byzantinification and de-ottomanisation in favour of promoting the countrys ancient greek heritage in this spirit the national capital was moved from nafplio where it had been since 1829 to athens which was at the time a village religious reform also took place and the church of greece was established as greeces national church although otto remained a catholic 25 march the day of annunciation was chosen as the anniversary of the greek war of independence in order to reinforce the link between greek identity and orthodoxy pavlos karolidis called the bavarian efforts to create a modern state in greece as not only appropriate for the peoples needs but also based on excellent administrative principles of the eraotto was deposed in the 23 october 1862 revolution multiple causes led to his deposition and exile including the bavarian-dominated government heavy taxation and a failed attempt to annex crete from the ottoman empire the catalyst for the revolt was ottos dismissal of konstantinos kanaris from the premiership a year later he was replaced by prince wilhelm william of denmark who took the name george i and brought with him the ionian islands as a coronation gift from britain a new constitution in 1864 changed greeces form of government from constitutional monarchy to the more democratic crowned republic in 1875 the concept of parliamentary majority as a requirement for the formation of a government was introduced by charilaos trikoupis curbing the power of the monarchy to appoint minority governments of its preference

corruption coupled with trikoupis increased spending to fund infrastructure projects like the corinth canal overtaxed the weak greek economy and forced the declaration of public insolvency in 1893 greece also accepted the imposition of an international financial control authority to pay off the countrys debtors another political issue in 19th-century greece was uniquely greek the language question the greek people spoke a form of greek called demotic many of the educated elite saw this as a peasant dialect and were determined to restore the glories of ancient greek
government documents and newspapers were consequently published in katharevousa purified greek a form which few ordinary greeks could read liberals favoured recognising demotic as the national language but conservatives and the orthodox church resisted all such efforts to the extent that when the new testament was translated into demotic in 1901 riots erupted in athens and the government fell the evangeliaka this issue would continue to plague greek politics until the 1970s
all greeks were united however in their determination to liberate the hellenic lands under ottoman rule especially in crete a prolonged revolt in 1866–1869 had raised nationalist fervour when war broke out between russia and the ottomans in 1877 greek popular sentiment rallied to russias side but greece was too poor and too concerned about british intervention to officially enter the war nevertheless in 1881 thessaly and small parts of epirus were ceded to greece as part of the treaty of berlin while frustrating greek hopes of receiving crete
greeks in crete continued to stage regular revolts and in 1897 the greek government under theodoros deligiannis bowing to popular pressure declared war on the ottomans in the ensuing greco-turkish war of 1897 the badly trained and equipped greek army was defeated by the ottomans through the intervention of the great powers however greece lost only a little territory along the border to turkey while crete was established as an autonomous state under prince george of greece with state coffers empty fiscal policy came under international financial control alarmed by the abortive ilinden uprising of the autonomist imro in 1903 the greek government aiming to quell imro bands and detach the slavophone peasants of the region from bulgarian influence sponsored a guerilla campaign in ottoman-ruled macedonia led by greek officers and known as the macedonian struggle which ended with the young turk revolution in 1908


 expansion disaster and reconstruction 

amidst general dissatisfaction with the seeming inertia and unattainability of national aspirations under the premiership of the cautious reformist theotokis a group of military officers organised a coup in august 1909 and shortly thereafter called to athens cretan politician eleftherios venizelos who conveyed a vision of national regeneration after winning two elections and becoming prime minister in 1910 venizelos initiated wide-ranging fiscal social and constitutional reforms reorganised the military made greece a member of the balkan league and led the country through the balkan wars by 1913 greeces territory and population had almost doubled annexing crete epirus and macedonia in the following years the struggle between king constantine i and charismatic venizelos over the countrys foreign policy on the eve of first world war dominated the countrys political scene and divided the country into two opposing groups during parts of the ww1 greece had two governments a royalist pro-german one in athens and a venizelist pro-entente one in thessaloniki the two governments were united in 1917 when greece officially entered the war on the side of the entente

in the aftermath of world war i greece attempted further expansion into asia minor a region with a large native greek population at the time but was defeated in the greco-turkish war of 1919–1922 contributing to a massive flight of asia minor greeks these events overlapped with both happening during the greek genocide 1914–1922 a period during which according to various sources ottoman and turkish officials contributed to the death of several hundred thousand asia minor greeks along with similar numbers of assyrians and a rather larger number of armenians the resultant greek exodus from asia minor was made permanent and expanded in an official population exchange between greece and turkey the exchange was part of the terms of the treaty of lausanne which ended the warthe following era was marked by instability as over 1.5 million propertyless greek refugees from turkey had to be integrated into greek society cappadocian greeks pontian greeks and non-greek followers of greek orthodoxy were all subject to the exchange as well some of the refugees could not speak the language and were from what had been unfamiliar environments to mainland greeks such as in the case of the cappadocians and non-greeks the refugees also made a dramatic post-war population boost as the number of refugees was more than a quarter of greeces prior populationfollowing the catastrophic events in asia minor the monarchy was abolished via a referendum in 1924 and the second hellenic republic was declared in 1935 a royalist general-turned-politician georgios kondylis took power after a coup détat and abolished the republic holding a rigged referendum after which king george ii returned to greece and was restored to the throne


 dictatorship world war ii and reconstruction 

an agreement between prime minister ioannis metaxas and the head of state george ii followed in 1936 which installed metaxas as the head of a dictatorial regime known as the 4th of august regime inaugurating a period of authoritarian rule that would last with short breaks until 1974 although a dictatorship greece remained on good terms with britain and was not allied with the axis

on 28 october 1940 fascist italy demanded the surrender of greece but the greek administration refused and in the following greco-italian war greece repelled italian forces into albania giving the allies their first victory over axis forces on land the greek struggle and victory against the italians received exuberant praise at the time most prominent is the quote attributed to winston churchill hence we will not say that greeks fight like heroes but we will say that heroes fight like greeks french general charles de gaulle was among those who praised the fierceness of the greek resistance in an official notice released to coincide with the greek national celebration of the day of independence de gaulle expressed his admiration for the greek resistancein the name of the captured yet still alive french people france wants to send her greetings to the greek people who are fighting for their freedom the 25 march 1941 finds greece in the peak of their heroic struggle and in the top of their glory since the battle of salamis greece had not achieved the greatness and the glory which today holds the country would eventually fall to urgently dispatched german forces during the battle of greece despite the fierce greek resistance particularly in the battle of the metaxas line adolf hitler himself recognised the bravery and the courage of the greek army stating in his address to the reichstag on 11 december 1941 that historical justice obliges me to state that of the enemies who took up positions against us the greek soldier particularly fought with the highest courage he capitulated only when further resistance had become impossible and uselessthe nazis proceeded to administer athens and thessaloniki while other regions of the country were given to nazi germanys partners fascist italy and bulgaria the occupation brought about terrible hardships for the greek civilian population over 100,000 civilians died of starvation during the winter of 1941–1942 tens of thousands more died because of reprisals by nazis and collaborators the countrys economy was ruined and the great majority of greek jews were deported and murdered in nazi concentration camps the greek resistance one of the most effective resistance movements in europe fought vehemently against the nazis and their collaborators the german occupiers committed numerous atrocities mass executions and wholesale slaughter of civilians and destruction of towns and villages in reprisals in the course of the concerted anti-guerilla campaign hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost 1,000,000 greeks left homeless in total the germans executed some 21,000 greeks the bulgarians 40,000 and the italians 9,000following liberation and the allied victory over the axis greece annexed the dodecanese islands from italy and regained western thrace from bulgaria the country almost immediately descended into a bloody civil war between communist forces and the anti-communist greek government which lasted until 1949 with the latters victory the conflict considered one of the earliest struggles of the cold war resulted in further economic devastation mass population displacement and severe political polarisation for the next thirty yearsalthough the post-war decades were characterised by social strife and widespread marginalisation of the left in political and social spheres greece nonetheless experienced rapid economic growth and recovery propelled in part by the us-administered marshall plan in 1952 greece joined nato reinforcing its membership in the western bloc of the cold war


 military regime 1967–74 
king constantine iis dismissal of george papandreous centrist government in july 1965 prompted a prolonged period of political turbulence which culminated in a coup détat on 21 april 1967 by the regime of the colonels under the junta civil rights were suspended political repression was intensified and human rights abuses including state-sanctioned torture were rampant economic growth remained rapid before plateauing in 1972 the brutal suppression of the athens polytechnic uprising on 17 november 1973 set in motion the events that caused the fall of the papadopoulos regime resulting in a counter-coup which overthrew georgios papadopoulos and established  brigadier dimitrios ioannidis as the new junta strongman on 20 july 1974 turkey invaded the island of cyprus in response to a greek-backed cypriot coup triggering a political crisis in greece that led to the regimes collapse and the restoration of democracy through metapolitefsi


 third hellenic republic 

the former prime minister konstantinos karamanlis was invited back from paris where he had lived in self-exile since 1963 marking the beginning of the metapolitefsi era the first multiparty elections since 1964 were held on the first anniversary of the polytechnic uprising a democratic and republican constitution was promulgated on 11 june 1975 following a referendum which chose to not restore the monarchy
meanwhile andreas papandreou george papandreous son founded the panhellenic socialist movement pasok in response to karamanliss conservative new democracy party with the two political formations dominating in government over the next four decades greece rejoined nato in 1980 greece became the tenth member of the european communities subsequently subsumed by the european union on 1 january 1981 ushering in a period of sustained growth widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure as well as funds from the european union and growing revenues from tourism shipping and a fast-growing service sector raised the countrys standard of living to unprecedented levels traditionally strained relations with neighbouring turkey improved when successive earthquakes hit both nations in 1999 leading to the lifting of the greek veto against turkeys bid for eu membership
the country adopted the euro in 2001 and successfully hosted the 2004 summer olympic games in athens more recently greece has suffered greatly from the late-2000s recession and has been central to the related european sovereign debt crisis due to the adoption of the euro when greece experienced financial crisis it could no longer devalue its currency to regain competitiveness youth unemployment was especially high during the 2000s the greek government-debt crisis and subsequent austerity policies have resulted in protests

by late 2009 as a result of a combination of international and local factors the greek economy which had fared well for much of the 20th century with high growth rates and low public debt faced its most-severe crisis since the restoration of democracy in 1974 when the greek government revised its deficit from an estimated 6% to 12.7% of gdp in the years before the crisis goldman sachs jpmorgan chase and numerous other banks had developed financial products which enabled the governments of greece italy and many other european countries to hide their borrowing dozens of similar agreements were concluded across europe whereby banks supplied cash in advance in exchange for future payments by the governments involved in turn the liabilities of the involved countries were kept off the books these conditions had enabled greece as well as other european governments to spend beyond their means while meeting the deficit targets set out in the maastricht treatyin may 2010 the greeces deficit was again revised and estimated to be 13.6% which was the second highest in the world relative to gdp with iceland in first place at 15.7% and the united kingdom in third with 12.6 public debt was forecast according to some estimates to hit 120% of gdp in the same year causing a crisis of confidence in greeces ability pay back loans
to avert a sovereign default greece the other eurozone members and the international monetary fund agreed on a rescue package which involved giving greece an immediate €45 billion in loans with additional funds to follow totaling €110 billion to secure the funding greece was required to adopt harsh austerity measures to bring its deficit under control a second bail-out amounting to €130 billion 173 billion was agreed in 2012 subject to strict conditions including financial reforms and further austerity measures a debt haircut was also agreed as part of the deal greece achieved a primary government budget surplus in 2013 while in april 2014 it returned to the global bond market greece returned to growth after six years of economic decline in the second quarter of 2014 and was the eurozones fastest-growing economy in the third quarter a third bailout was agreed in july 2015 after a confrontation with the newly-elected government of alexis tsipras  
there was a 25% drop in greeces gdp connected with the bailout programmes this had a critical effect the debt-to-gdp ratio the key factor defining the severity of the crisis would jump from its 2009 level of 127% to about 170 solely due to the shrinking economy in a 2013 report the imf admitted that it had underestimated the effects of so extensive tax hikes and budget cuts on the countrys gdp and issued an informal apology the greek programmes imposed a very rapid improvement in structural primary balance at least two times faster than for other eurozone bailed-out countries   the policies have been blamed for worsening the crisis while greeces president prokopis pavlopoulos stressed the creditors share in responsibility for the depth of the crisis greek prime minister alexis tsipras asserted that errors in the design of the first two programmes which lead to a loss of 25% of the greek economy due to the harsh imposition of excessive austeritybetween 2009 and 2017 the greek government debt rose from €300 bn to €318 bn ie by only about 6% thanks in part to the 2012 debt restructuring however during the same period the critical debt-to-gdp ratio shot up from 127% to 179% basically due to the severe gdp drop during the handling of the crisis

the ancient community of greek jews are called romaniotes while the sephardi jews were once a prominent community in the city of thessaloniki numbering some 80,000 or more than half of the population by 1900 however after the german occupation of greece and the holocaust during world war ii is estimated to number around 5,500 peoplethe roman catholic community is estimated to be around 250,000 of which 50,000 are greek citizens their community is nominally separate from the smaller greek byzantine catholic church which recognizes the primacy of the pope but maintains the liturgy of the byzantine rite old calendarists account for 500,000 followers protestants including the greek evangelical church and free evangelical churches stand at about 30,000 other christian minorities such as assemblies of god international church of the foursquare gospel and various pentecostal churches of the greek synod of apostolic church total about 12,000 members the independent free apostolic church of pentecost is the biggest protestant denomination in greece with 120 churches there are no official statistics about free apostolic church of pentecost but the orthodox church estimates the followers as 20,000 the jehovahs witnesses report having 28,874 active memberssince 2017 hellenic polytheism or helenism has been legally recognised as an actively practiced religion in greece with estimates of 2,000 active practitioners and an additional 100,000 sympathisers hellenism refers to various religious movements that continue revive or reconstruct ancient greek religious practices


 languages 

the first textual evidence of the greek language dates back to 15th century bc and the linear b script which is associated with the mycenaean civilization greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the mediterranean world and beyond during classical antiquity and would eventually become the official parlance of the byzantine empire
during the 19th and 20th centuries there was a major dispute known as the greek language question on whether the official language of greece should be the archaic katharevousa created in the 19th century and used as the state and scholarly language or the dimotiki the form of the greek language which evolved naturally from byzantine greek and was the language of the people the dispute was finally resolved in 1976 when dimotiki was made the only official variation of the greek language and katharevousa fell to disuse
greece is today relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms with a large majority of the native population using greek as their first or only language among the greek-speaking population speakers of the distinctive pontic dialect came to greece from asia minor after the greek genocide and constitute a sizable group the cappadocian dialect came to greece due to the genocide as well but is endangered and is barely spoken now indigenous greek dialects include the archaic greek spoken by the sarakatsani traditionally transhument mountain shepherds of greek macedonia and other parts of northern greece the tsakonian language a distinct greek language deriving from doric greek instead of koine greek is still spoken in some villages in the southeastern peloponnese
the muslim minority in thrace which amounts to approximately 0.95% of the total population consists of speakers of turkish bulgarian pomaks and romani romani is also spoken by christian roma in other parts of the country further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the greek-speaking majority
today they are only maintained by the older generations and are on the verge of extinction this goes for the arvanites an albanian-speaking group mostly located in the rural areas around the capital athens and for the aromanians and moglenites also known as vlachs whose language is closely related to romanian and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountainous central greece members of these groups ethnically identify as greeks and are today all at least bilingual in greek
near the northern greek borders there are also some slavic–speaking groups locally known as slavomacedonian-speaking most of whose members identify ethnically as greeks it is estimated that after the population exchanges of 1923 macedonia had 200,000 to 400,000 slavic speakers the jewish community in greece traditionally spoke ladino judeo-spanish today maintained only by a few thousand speakers other notable minority languages include armenian georgian and the greco-turkic dialect spoken by the urums a community of caucasus greeks from the tsalka region of central georgia and ethnic greeks from southeastern ukraine who arrived in mainly northern greece as economic migrants in the 1990s


 migration 

throughout the 20th century millions of greeks migrated to the united states united kingdom australia canada and germany creating a large greek diaspora net migration started to show positive numbers from the 1970s but until the beginning of the 1990s the main influx was that of returning greek migrants or of pontic greeks and others from russia georgia turkey the czech republic and elsewhere in the former soviet bloca study from the mediterranean migration observatory maintains that the 2001 census recorded 762,191 persons residing in greece without greek citizenship constituting around 7% of total population of the non-citizen residents 48,560 were eu or european free trade association nationals and 17,426 were cypriots with privileged status the majority come from eastern european countries albania 56 bulgaria 5 and romania 3 while migrants from the former soviet union georgia russia ukraine moldova etc comprise 10% of the total some of the immigrants from albania are from the greek minority in albania centred on the region of northern epirus in addition the total albanian national population which includes temporary migrants and undocumented persons is around 600,000the 2011 census recorded 9,903,268 greek citizens 91,56 480,824 albanian citizens 4,44 75,915 bulgarian citizens 0,7 46,523 romanian citizenship 0,43 34,177 pakistani citizens 0,32 27,400 georgian citizens 0,25 and 247,090 people had other or unidentified citizenship 2,3 189,000 people of the total population of albanian citizens were reported in 2008 as ethnic greeks from southern albania in the historical region of northern epirusthe greatest cluster of non-eu immigrant population are the larger urban centers especially the municipality of athens with 132,000 immigrants comprising 17% of the local population and then thessaloniki with 27,000 immigrants reaching 7% of the local population there is also a considerable number of co-ethnics that came from the greek communities of albania and the former soviet uniongreece together with italy and spain is a major entry point for illegal immigrants trying to enter the eu illegal immigrants entering greece mostly do so from the border with turkey at the evros river and the islands of the eastern aegean across from turkey mainly lesbos chios kos and samos in 2012 the majority of illegal immigrants entering greece came from afghanistan followed by pakistanis and bangladeshis in 2015 arrivals of refugees by sea had increased dramatically mainly due to the ongoing syrian civil war there were 856,723 arrivals by sea in greece an almost fivefold increase to the same period of 2014 of which the syrians represent almost 45 the majority of refugees and migrants use greece as a transit country while their intended destinations are northern european nations such as austria germany and sweden

 culture 

the culture of greece has evolved over thousands of years beginning in mycenaean greece and continuing most notably into classical greece through the influence of the roman empire and its greek eastern continuation the eastern roman or byzantine empire other cultures and nations such as the latin and frankish states the ottoman empire the venetian republic the genoese republic and the british empire have also left their influence on modern greek culture although historians credit the greek war of independence with revitalising greece and giving birth to a single cohesive entity of its multi-faceted culture
in ancient times greece was the birthplace of western culture modern democracies owe a debt to greek beliefs in government by the people trial by jury and equality under the law the ancient greeks pioneered in many fields that rely on systematic thought including biology geometry history philosophy physics and mathematics they introduced such important literary forms as epic and lyric poetry history tragedy and comedy in their pursuit of order and proportion the greeks created an ideal of beauty that strongly influenced western art


 visual arts 

artistic production in greece began in the prehistoric pre-greek cycladic and the minoan civilizations both of which were influenced by local traditions and the art of ancient egyptthere were several interconnected traditions of painting in ancient greece due to their technical differences they underwent somewhat differentiated developments not all painting techniques are equally well represented in the archaeological record the most respected form of art according to authors like pliny or pausanias were individual mobile paintings on wooden boards technically described as panel paintings also the tradition of wall painting in greece goes back at least to the minoan and mycenaean bronze age with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like knossos tiryns and mycenae much of the figural or architectural sculpture of ancient greece was painted colourfully this aspect of greek stonework is described as polychrome
ancient greek sculpture was composed almost entirely of marble or bronze with cast bronze becoming the favoured medium for major works by the early 5th century both marble and bronze are easy to form and very durable chryselephantine sculptures used for temple cult images and luxury works used gold most often in leaf form and ivory for all or parts faces and hands of the figure and probably gems and other materials but were much less common and only fragments have survived by the early 19th century the systematic excavation of ancient greek sites had brought forth a plethora of sculptures with traces of notably multicolored surfaces it was not until published findings by german archaeologist vinzenz brinkmann in the late 20th century that the painting of ancient greek sculptures became an established factthe art production continued also during the byzantine era the most salient feature of this new aesthetic was its “abstract” or anti-naturalistic character if classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favor of a more symbolic approach the byzantine painting concentrated mainly on icons and hagiographies the macedonian art byzantine was the artistic expression of macedonian renaissance a label sometimes used to describe the period of the macedonian dynasty of the byzantine empire 867–1056 especially the 10th century which some scholars have seen as a time of increased interest in classical scholarship and the assimilation of classical motifs into christian artwork
post byzantine art schools include the cretan school and heptanese school the first artistic movement in the greek kingdom can be considered the greek academic art of the 19th century munich school notable modern greek painters include nikolaos gyzis georgios jakobides theodoros vryzakis nikiforos lytras konstantinos volanakis nikos engonopoulos and yannis tsarouchis while some notable sculptors are pavlos prosalentis ioannis kossos leonidas drosis georgios bonanos and yannoulis chalepas


 architecture 

the architecture of ancient greece was produced by the ancient greeks hellenes whose culture flourished on the greek mainland the aegean islands and their colonies for a period from about 900 bc until the 1st century ad with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 bc the formal vocabulary of ancient greek architecture in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders the doric order the ionic order and the corinthian order was to have profound effect on western architecture of later periods
byzantine architecture is the architecture promoted by the byzantine empire also known as the eastern roman empire which dominated greece and the greek speaking world during the middle ages the empire endured for more than a millennium dramatically influencing medieval architecture throughout europe and the near east and becoming the primary progenitor of the renaissance and ottoman architectural traditions that followed its collapse
after the greek independence the modern greek architects tried to combine traditional greek and byzantine elements and motives with the western european movements and styles patras was the first city of the modern greek state to develop a city plan in january 1829 stamatis voulgaris a greek engineer of the french army presented the plan of the new city to the governor kapodistrias who approved it voulgaris applied the orthogonal rule in the urban complex of patrastwo special genres can be considered the cycladic architecture featuring white-coloured houses in the cyclades and the epirotic architecture in the region of epirusafter the establishment of the greek kingdom the architecture of athens and other cities was mostly influenced by the neoclassical architecture for athens the first king of greece otto of greece commissioned the architects stamatios kleanthis and eduard schaubert to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state as for thessaloniki after the fire of 1917 the government ordered for a new city plan under the supervision of ernest hébrard other modern greek architects include anastasios metaxas panagis kalkos ernst ziller dimitris pikionis and georges candilis


 theatre 

theatre in its western form was born in greece the city-state of classical athens which became a significant cultural political and military power during this period was its centre where it was institutionalised as part of a festival called the dionysia which honoured the god dionysus tragedy late 6th century bc comedy 486 bc and the satyr play were the three dramatic genres to emerge there
during the byzantine period the theatrical art was heavily declined according to marios ploritis the only form survived was the folk theatre mimos and pantomimos despite the hostility of the official state later during the ottoman period the main theatrical folk art was the karagiozis the renaissance which led to the modern greek theatre took place in the venetian crete significal dramatists include vitsentzos kornaros and georgios chortatzis
the modern greek theatre was born after the greek independence in the early 19th century and initially was influenced by the heptanesean theatre and melodrama such as the italian opera the nobile teatro di san giacomo di corfù was the first theatre and opera house of modern greece and the place where the first greek opera spyridon xyndas the parliamentary candidate based on an exclusively greek libretto was performed during the late 19th and early 20th century the athenian theatre scene was dominated by revues musical comedies operettas and nocturnes and notable playwrights included spyridon samaras dionysios lavrangas theophrastos sakellaridis and others
the national theatre of greece was opened in 1900 as royal theatre notable playwrights of the modern greek theatre include gregorios xenopoulos nikos kazantzakis pantelis horn alekos sakellarios and iakovos kambanelis while notable actors include cybele andrianou marika kotopouli aimilios veakis orestis makris katina paxinou manos katrakis and dimitris horn significant directors include dimitris rontiris alexis minotis and karolos koun


 literature 

greek literature can be divided into three main categories ancient byzantine and modern greek literatureathens is considered the birthplace of western literature at the beginning of greek literature stand the two monumental works of homer the iliad and the odyssey though dates of composition vary these works were fixed around 800 bc or after in the classical period many of the genres of western literature became more prominent lyrical poetry odes pastorals elegies epigrams dramatic presentations of comedy and tragedy historiography rhetorical treatises philosophical dialectics and philosophical treatises all arose in this period the two major lyrical poets were sappho and pindar the classical era also saw the dawn of drama
of the hundreds of tragedies written and performed during the classical age only a limited number of plays by three authors have survived those of aeschylus sophocles and euripides the surviving plays by aristophanes are also a treasure trove of comic presentation while herodotus and thucydides are two of the most influential historians in this period the greatest prose achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy with the works of the three great philosophers
byzantine literature refers to literature of the byzantine empire written in atticizing medieval and early modern greek and it is the expression of the intellectual life of the byzantine greeks during the christian middle ages although popular byzantine literature and early modern greek literature both began in the 11th century the two are indistinguishable

modern greek literature refers to literature written in common modern greek emerging from late byzantine times in the 11th century the cretan renaissance poem erotokritos is undoubtedly the masterpiece of this period of greek literature it is a verse romance written around 1600 by vitsentzos kornaros 1553–1613 later during the period of greek enlightenment diafotismos writers such as adamantios korais and rigas feraios prepared with their works the greek revolution 1821–1830
leading figures of modern greek literature include dionysios solomos andreas kalvos angelos sikelianos emmanuel rhoides demetrius vikelas kostis palamas penelope delta yannis ritsos alexandros papadiamantis nikos kazantzakis andreas embeirikos kostas karyotakis gregorios xenopoulos constantine p cavafy nikos kavvadias kostas varnalis and kiki dimoula two greek authors have been awarded the nobel prize in literature george seferis in 1963 and odysseas elytis in 1979


 philosophy 

most western philosophical traditions began in ancient greece in the 6th century bc the first philosophers are called presocratics which designates that they came before socrates whose contributions mark a turning point in western thought the presocratics were from the western or the eastern colonies of greece and only fragments of their original writings survive in some cases merely a single sentence
a new period of philosophy started with socrates like the sophists he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged and made the thoughts and opinions of people his starting-point aspects of socrates were first united from plato who also combined with them many of the principles established by earlier philosophers and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system
aristotle of stagira the most important disciple of plato shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity but while plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience except from these three most significant greek philosophers other known schools of greek philosophy from other founders during ancient times were stoicism epicureanism skepticism and neoplatonismbyzantine philosophy refers to the distinctive philosophical ideas of the philosophers and scholars of the byzantine empire especially between the 8th and 15th centuries it was characterised by a christian world-view but one which could draw ideas directly from the greek texts of plato aristotle and the neoplatonists
on the eve of the fall of constantinople gemistus pletho tried to restore the use of the term hellene and advocated the return to the olympian gods of the ancient world after 1453 a number of greek byzantine scholars who fled to western europe contributed to the renaissance
in modern period diafotismos greek διαφωτισμόσ enlightenment illumination was the greek expression of the age of enlightenment and its philosophical and political ideas some notable representatives were adamantios korais rigas feraios and theophilos kairis
other modern era greek philosophers or political scientists include cornelius castoriadis nicos poulantzas and christos yannaras


 music and dances 

greek vocal music extends far back into ancient times where mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment celebration and spiritual reasons instruments during that period included the double-reed aulos and the plucked string instrument the lyre especially the special kind called a kithara music played an important role in the education system during ancient times boys were taught music from the age of six later influences from the roman empire middle east and the byzantine empire also had effect on greek music
while the new technique of polyphony was developing in the west the eastern orthodox church resisted any type of change therefore byzantine music remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment as a result and despite certain attempts by certain greek chanters such as manouel gazis ioannis plousiadinos or the cypriot ieronimos o tragoudistis byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the west encouraged an unimpeded development of art however this method which kept music away from polyphony along with centuries of continuous culture enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection byzantium presented the monophonic byzantine chant a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power
along with the byzantine church chant and music the greek people also cultivated the greek folk song demotiko which is divided into two cycles the akritic and klephtic the akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries and expressed the life and struggles of the akrites frontier guards of the byzantine empire the most well known being the stories associated with digenes akritas the klephtic cycle came into being between the late byzantine period and the start of the greek war of independence the klephtic cycle together with historical songs paraloghes narrative song or ballad love songs mantinades wedding songs songs of exile and dirges express the life of the greeks there is a unity between the greek peoples struggles for freedom their joys and sorrow and attitudes towards love and death

the heptanesean kantádhes καντάδεσ serenades sing καντάδα became the forerunners of the greek modern urban popular song influencing its development to a considerable degree for the first part of the next century several greek composers continued to borrow elements from the heptanesean style the most successful songs during the period 1870–1930 were the so-called athenian serenades and the songs performed on stage επιθεωρησιακά τραγούδια theatrical revue songs in revue operettas and nocturnes that were dominating athens theater scene
rebetiko initially a music associated with the lower classes later and especially after the population exchange between greece and turkey reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished sometimes to the point of unrecognizability it was the base of the later laïkó song of the people the leading performers of the genre include vassilis tsitsanis grigoris bithikotsis stelios kazantzidis george dalaras haris alexiou and glykeria
regarding the classical music it was through the ionian islands which were under western rule and influence that all the major advances of the western european classical music were introduced to mainland greeks the region is notable for the birth of the first school of modern greek classical music heptanesean or ionian school greek επτανησιακή σχολή established in 1815 prominent representatives of this genre include nikolaos mantzaros spyridon xyndas spyridon samaras and pavlos carrer manolis kalomiris is considered the founder of the greek national school of music
in the 20th century greek composers have had a significant impact on the development of avant garde and modern classical music with figures such as iannis xenakis nikos skalkottas and dimitri mitropoulos achieving international prominence at the same time composers and musicians such as mikis theodorakis manos hatzidakis eleni karaindrou vangelis and demis roussos garnered an international following for their music which include famous film scores such as zorba the greek serpico never on sunday america america eternity and a day chariots of fire blade runner among others greek american composers known for their film scores include also yanni and basil poledouris notable greek opera singers and classical musicians of the 20th and 21st century include maria callas nana mouskouri mario frangoulis leonidas kavakos dimitris sgouros and others
during the dictatorship of the colonels the music of mikis theodorakis was banned by the junta and the composer was jailed internally exiled and put in a concentration camp before finally being allowed to leave greece due to international reaction to his detention released during the junta years anthrope agapa ti fotia stamata make love stop the gunfire by the pop group poll is considered the first anti-war protest song in the history of greek rock the song was echoing the hippie slogan make love not war and was inspired directly by the vietnam war becoming a smash hit in greecegreece participated in the eurovision song contest 35 times after its debut at the 1974 contest in 2005 greece won with the song my number one performed by greek-swedish singer elena paparizou the song received 230 points with 10 sets of 12 points from belgium bulgaria hungary the united kingdom turkey albania cyprus serbia  montenegro sweden and germany and also became a smash hit in different countries and especially in greece the 51st eurovision song contest was held in athens at the olympic indoor hall of the athens olympic sports complex in maroussi with hosted by maria menounos and sakis rouvas
