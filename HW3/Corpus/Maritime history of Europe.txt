maritime history of europe includes past events relating to the northwestern region of eurasia in areas concerning shipping and shipbuilding shipwrecks naval battles and military installations and lighthouses constructed to protect or aid navigation and the development of europe 
europe is situated between several navigable seas and intersected by navigable rivers running into them in a way which greatly facilitated the influence of maritime traffic and commerce great battles have been fought in the seas off of europe that changed the course of history forever including the battle of salamis in the mediterranean the battle of gravelines at the eastern end of the english channel in the summer of 1588 in which the “invincible”   spanish armada was defeated the battle of jutland in world war i and world war ii’s u-boat war


 ancient times 

although the egyptians built the first sea-going ships the minoans of crete were the first great seafarers of the mediterranean sea little is known of their ships but they reportedly traded pottery as far west as sicily and their king minos conquered the islands of the aegean according to thucydides
the battle of salamis occurred in september 480 bc when the greeks with 371 triremes and pentekonters routed a persian force of over 1,200 ships under the command of king xerxes persian losses amounted to some 200 ships and 20,000 men the battle was fought near athens greece in the straits between piraeus and salamis


 maritime history of the roman empire 

roman galleys helped to build the roman empire the empires’ struggle with carthage inspired them to build and to fight in war galleys but the galleys did not have much cargo space so “round ships” were constructed for trade especially with egypt many of these ships reached 200 feet 61 m in length and were capable of carrying over a thousand tons of cargo these ships used sail power alone to haul commodities in the mediterranean the volume of trade that the roman merchant fleet carried was larger than any other until the industrial revolution we know quite a bit about these round ships since romans like egyptians and greeks left records in stone sometimes even on a sarcophagus
there were many shipwrecks of roman vessels which can be explained by the very large number of trading vessels during roman times since the volume of sea trade in the mediterranean reached a quantity to be only equaled in the 19th century this greatly increased the number of shipwrecks
the western mediterranean came under the control of the barbarians after their invasion split the empire in two while byzantium dominated the eastern half of the sea the eastern empire lasted until 1453 such was the efficiency of the byzantine navy with its fleets armed with byzantine fire or greek fire a mixture of naphtha oil and saltpetre fired through tubes in the bows of the ship  enemy ships were often afraid to get too close to the byzantine fleet since the liquid fire gave the byzantines a considerable advantage


 the viking age 

also called the vikings the norsemen raided towns and villages along the coasts of the british isles scandinavia as far south as cádiz spain and even attacked pisa italy in 860 they sailed up the seine river in france settled normandy which derives its name from the norsemen and settled dublin after invading ireland varangians were more concerned with trading than raiding and sailed along russian rivers and opened commercial routes to the caspian sea as well as the black sea
the vikings were the best naval architects of their day and the viking longship was both large and versatile a longship found at oseberg norway was 76 feet 6 inches 23.32 m more than 17 feet 5.18 m wide and had a draft of only 3 feet 0.91 m the shallow draft enabled them to navigate far inland in shallow rivers later on during the viking period some of the ships were reported to be over 100 feet 30 m long
from the fury of the norsemen good lord deliver us has entered apocryphal knowledge as a common prayer among the people of western europe during the period of the norse raiders from the late 8th century to the 11th century according to the website viking answer lady
which in turn cites magnus magnussons vikings as its reference 

no 9th century text has ever been discovered containing these words although numerous medieval litanies and prayers contain general formulas for deliverance against unnamed enemies the closest documentable phrase is a single sentence taken from an antiphony for churches dedicated to st vaast or st medard summa pia gratia nostra conservando corpora et custodita de gente fera normannica nos libera quae nostra vastat deus regna ”oh highest pious grace free us oh god by preserving our bodies and those in our keeping from the cruel norse people who ravage our realms”


 the hanseatic league 

 
the hanseatic league was an alliance of trading cities that established and maintained a trade monopoly over the baltic sea and most of northern europe for a time in the later middle ages and the early modern period between the 13th and 17th centuries 
although trading alliances in the region were forming as early as 1157 the town of lübeck did not form an alliance with hamburg which controlled access to salt routes from lüneburg until 1241
trade was carried on chiefly by sea in order to escape tolls and political barriers and at the end of the 15th century the hanseatic league controlled some 60,000 tons of shipping although compasses were commonly being used in the mediterranean during this period the captains of hanseatic vessels seemed slow to adopt the new technology which put them in greater danger of wrecking they also had to deal with pirates
the league’s power waned when the great herring shoals disappeared in the baltic possibly because of a decline in the sea’s salinity during the late 16th century and early 17th century the league fell apart as it was unable to deal with its own internal struggles the rise of swedish dutch and english merchants and the social and political changes that accompanied the reformation
although a tight-fisted monopoly the league’s need for more cargo space led to new designs in shipbuilding and its free association of about 160 towns and villages was a historically unique economic alliance that showed the benefits of well-regulated commerce


 republic of venice 
 
around 1300 venice began to develop the great galley of commerce the ‘’galea grossa’’ it grew to carry a crew of more than 200 and weighed as much as 250 tons these galleys took passengers and goods to constantinople now istanbul and to alexandria in egypt and returned to venice carrying luxury items a sea route to the indies discovered by portugal signaled an end to the glory days of venices merchant galleys and spice trade but the war galleys or fighting galleys lived on the war galleys were mostly manned by prisoners of war or convicts who were chained to benches usually three to six per oar
more than 3,000 venetian merchant ships were in operation by the year 1450 the trading empire of the republic of venice lasted longer than any other in history and even merchants vessels were required to carry weapons and passengers were expected to be armed and ready to fight from the beginning of the 13th century until the end of the 18th century the republic ruled the adriatic the aegean and the black seas the republic of genoa was venice’s main rival and many wars were fought between them in 1298 the genoese destroyed the venetian fleet at curzola but were themselves defeated in 1354 at sapienza in greece


 the european age of discovery 1400–1600 
the age of discovery started with the portuguese navigators where prince henry the navigator started a maritime school in portugal the resulting of this technical and scientific discoveries led portugal to develop the most advanced ships including the caravel the carrack and the galleon where for the first time in history maritime navigation was possible the portuguese empire led the portuguese kingdom to discover and map most of the globe and find seas routes as far as the east and west such as the remarkable voyage to find the sea route to india via the cape of good hope initially bartolomeu dias left portugal and rounded the cape of good hope with vasco da gama reaching the southern tip of africa and on-wards to india it was the first time in history that humans had navigated from europe around africa to asia it led to the discovery of brazil and south america and the first circumnavigation around the world with the portuguese nobleman ferdinand magellan sailing around the world across the entire pacific ocean for the first time
at the beginning of the 16th century sea clashes in the indian ocean as the decisive battle of diu in 1509 marked a turning point in history the shift from the mediterranean and from the relatively isolated seas disputed in antiquity and in the middle ages to the oceans and to the european hegemony on a global scale

christopher columbus set sail in santa maria on what is probably historys most well known voyage of discovery on august 3 1492 leaving from the town of palos in southern spain columbus headed west after a brief stop in the canary islands for provisions and repairs he set out for asia he reached san salvador first it is believed easternmost of the bahamas in october and then sailed past cuba and hispaniola still searching for asia he returned home in 1493 to a heros welcome and within six months had 1,500 men and 17 vessels at his command
the year 1571 saw the last great battle between galleys when more than 400 turkish and christian vessels engaged each other on the gulf of patras the battle of lepanto as it was called saw some 38,000 men perish miguel de cervantes author of don quixote was wounded during the battle
in april 1587 sir francis drake burned 37 spanish ships in the harbor at cádiz in southern spain
the publication of jan huygen van linschotens book voyages provided a significant turning point in europes maritime history before the publication of this book knowledge of the sea route to the far east had been well guarded by the portuguese for over a century voyages was published in several languages including english and german published in 1598 latin 1599 and french 1610 widely read by europeans the original dutch edition and the french translation had second editions published
once knowledge of the sea route became available to all europeans more ships headed to east asia a dutch fleet embarked on a voyage to india using linschotens charts in 1595 the dutch version of his book was published in 1596 but his sea charts had been published the previous year  the publication of the nautical maps enabled the dutch and british east india companies to break the trade monopoly portugal held with the east indies protestant europe was ushered into the age of discovery in large part thanks to his work


 european innovations 

from the sixth to the eighteenth centuries the maritime history of europe had a profound impact on the rest of the world  the broadside-cannoned full-rigged sixteenth-century sailing ship provided the continent with a weapon to dominate the world

during this time period europeans made remarkable inroads in maritime innovations these innovations enabled them to expand overseas and set up colonies most notably during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries   they developed new sail arrangements for ships skeleton-based shipbuilding the western “galea” at the end of the 11th century sophisticated navigational instruments and detailed charts after isaac newton published the principia navigation was transformed starting in 1670 the entire world was measured using essentially modern latitude instruments and the best available clocks in 1730 the sextant was invented and navigators rapidly replaced their astrolabes


 barbary pirates 
for several centuries from about the time of the crusades until the early 19th century the barbary pirates of northern africa preyed on ships in the western mediterranean sea in 1816 the royal navy with assistance from the dutch destroyed the barbary fleet in the port of algiers the best-known pirate of this period may have been barbarossa the nickname of khair ad din an ottoman-turkish admiral and privateer who was born on the island of lesbos present-day greece and lived from about 1475-1546


 siege of gibraltar and the battle of trafalgar 

july 1779 saw the start of the great siege of gibraltar an attempt by france and spain to wrest control of gibraltar from the british the garrison survived all attacks including an assault on september 13 1782 that included 48 ships and 450 cannon in october 1805 the battle of trafalgar took place which involved 60 vessels 27 british and 33 french and spanish the british did not lose a single ship and destroyed the enemy fleet but admiral lord nelson died in the battle it was the most significant naval battle of the beginning of the 19th century and confirmed the british navy’s supremacy of the time


 lighthouses 

the pharos of meloria is often considered the first lighthouse in europe since roman times meloria a rocky islet off the tuscan coast in the tyrrhenian sea was the location of two medieval naval battles  the tower of hercules torre de hércules in northwestern spain is almost 1,900 years old the ancient roman lighthouse stands near a coruña galicia and is 57 metres 185 ft in height it is the oldest working roman lighthouse in the world
according to smithsonian a lighthouse on the gironde river in france cardovan tower was the first lighthouse to use a fresnel lens in 1822 the light reportedly could be seen from more than 20 miles 32 km at sea
