decolonization of the americas refers to the process by which the countries in the americas gained their independence from european rule decolonization began with a series of revolutions in the late 18th and early to mid-19th centuries the status quo then prevailed for more than a century excepting the independence of cuba whose war for independence culminated in the spanish–american war
peaceful independence by voluntary withdrawal of colonial powers then became the norm in the second half of the 20th century however there are still many british and dutch colonies in north america mostly caribbean islands and france has fully integrated most of its former colonies as fully constituent departments of france


 united states 

the united states of america declared independence from great britain on july 2 1776 although the event is now commemorated on july 4 the date when the declaration of independence was officially adopted by congress in so doing becoming the first independent foreign-recognized nation in the americas and the first european colonial entity to break from its mother country britain formally acknowledged american independence in 1783 after its defeat in the american revolutionary war
although initially occupying only the land east of the mississippi between canada and florida the united states would later eventually acquire various other north american territories from the british french spanish and russians in succeeding years effectively decolonizing these areas formerly under european control


 haiti and the french antilles 

the american and french revolutions had profound effects on the spanish portuguese and french colonies in the americas haiti a french slave colony was the first to follow the united states to independence during the haitian revolution which lasted from 1791 to 1804 thwarted in his attempt to rebuild a french empire in north america napoleon bonaparte sold louisiana to the united states and from then on focused on the european theater marking the end of frances ambitions of building a colonial empire in the western hemisphere


 spanish america 

the spanish kingdoms in the americas won their independence in the first quarter of the 19th century
during the peninsular war napoleon installed his own brother joseph bonaparte on the spanish throne and captured the king fernando vii several assemblies were established after 1810 by the criollos to recover the sovereignty and self-government based in seven-part code for restoration the laws of castilian succession to rule the lands in the name of ferdinand vii of spain
this experience of self-government along with the influence of liberalism and the ideas of the french and american revolutions brought about a struggle for independence led by the libertadores the territories freed themselves often with help from foreign mercenaries and privateers united states europe and the british empire were neutral aimed to achieve political influence and trade without the spanish monopoly
in south america simón bolívar and josé de san martín led the final phase of the independence struggle although bolívar attempted to keep the spanish-speaking parts of the continent politically unified they rapidly became independent of one another as well and several further wars were fought such as the paraguayan war and the war of the pacific
a related process took place in what is now mexico central america and parts of north america between 1810 and 1821 with the mexican war of independence independence was achieved in 1821 by a coalition uniting under agustín de iturbide and the army of the three guarantees unity was maintained for a short period under the first mexican empire but within a decade the region fought against the united states over the border lands losing bordering lands of california and texas most of the heat was during the official mexican-american war from 1846 to 1848in 1898 in the greater antilles the united states won the spanish–american war and occupied cuba and puerto rico ending spanish territorial control in the americas


 brazil 

unlike the spanish the portuguese did not divide their colonial territory in the americas the captaincies they created were subdued to a centralized administration in salvador which reported directly to the crown in lisbon therefore it is not common to refer to portuguese america like spanish america dutch america etc but rather to brazil as a unified colony since its very beginnings
as a result brazil did not split into several states by the time of independence 1822 as happened to its spanish-speaking neighbors the adoption of monarchy instead of federal republic in the first six decades of brazilian political sovereignty also contributed to the nations unity
in the portuguese colony dom pedro i also pedro iv of portugal son of the portuguese king dom joão vi proclaimed the countrys independence in 1822 and became brazils first emperor this was generally peacefully accepted by the crown in portugal although some guerrillas were fought between portuguese troops and civilians portugal recognized brazils independence three years later upon compensation


 canada 

canadas transition from colonial rule to independence occurred gradually over many decades and was achieved mostly through political means as opposed to the violent revolutions that marked the end of colonialism in other north and south american countries attempts at revolting against the british such as the rebellion of 1837 were brief and quickly put down canada was declared a dominion within the british empire in 1867 originally the canadian confederation included just a few of what are now canadas eastern provinces other british colonies in modern-day canada such as british columbia prince edward island and newfoundland would join later additionally britains and norways claims to arctic lands were ceded to canada in the late 19th and early 20th century by 1931 the united kingdom had relinquished its control over canadas foreign policy what few political links that remained between canada and the uk were formally severed in 1982 with the canada act
