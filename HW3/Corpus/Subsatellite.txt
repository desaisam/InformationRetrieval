a subsatellite is a natural satellite or an artificial satellite that orbits a natural satellite ie a moon of a moon also known as a moonmoon submoon or grandmoonit is inferred from the empirical study of natural satellites in the solar system that subsatellites may be elements of planetary systems in the solar system the giant planets have large collections of natural satellites the majority of detected exoplanets are giant planets at least one kepler-1625b may have a very large exomoon named kepler-1625b i therefore it is reasonable to assume that subsatellites may exist in the solar system and in planetary systems beyond the solar system
nonetheless no moon of a moon or subsatellite is known as of  2018 in the solar system or beyond the solar system in most cases the tidal effects of the planet would make such a system unstable


 possible natural instances 


 rhea 

the possible detection of a ring system around saturns natural satellite rhea led to calculations that indicated that satellites orbiting rhea would have stable orbits furthermore the suspected rings are thought to be narrow a phenomenon normally associated with shepherd moons however targeted images taken by the cassini spacecraft failed to detect any subsatellites or rings associated with rhea


 iapetus 
it has also been proposed that saturns satellite iapetus possessed a subsatellite in the past this is one of several hypotheses that have been put forward to account for its unusual equatorial ridge


 artificial subsatellites 
many spacecraft have orbited the moon including manned craft of the apollo program as of  2018 none have orbited any other moons in 1988 the soviet union unsuccessfully attempted to put two unmanned probes on quasi-orbits around the martian moon phobos
