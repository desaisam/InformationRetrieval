dione  dy-oh-nee greek διώνη is a moon of saturn it was discovered by italian astronomer giovanni domenico cassini in 1684 it is named after the titaness dione of greek mythology it is also designated saturn iv


 name 
giovanni domenico cassini named the four moons he discovered tethys dione rhea and iapetus sidera lodoicea the stars of louis to honor king louis xiv cassini found dione in 1684 using a large aerial telescope he set up on the grounds of the paris observatory the satellites of saturn were not named until 1847 when william herschels son john herschel published results of astronomical observations made at the cape of good hope suggesting that the names of the titans sisters and brothers of cronus be used


 orbit 
dione orbits saturn with a semimajor axis about 2% less than that of the moon however reflecting saturns greater mass 95 times that of earths diones orbital period is one tenth that of the moon dione is currently in a 12 mean-motion orbital resonance with moon enceladus completing one orbit of saturn for every two orbits completed by enceladus this resonance maintains enceladuss orbital eccentricity 0.0047 providing a source of heat for enceladuss extensive geological activity which shows up most dramatically in its cryovolcanic geyser-like jets the resonance also maintains a smaller eccentricity in diones orbit 0.0022 tidally heating it as welldione has two co-orbital or trojan moons helene and polydeuces they are located within diones lagrangian points l4 and l5 60 degrees ahead of and behind dione respectively


 physical characteristics and interior 

at 1122 km 697 mi in diameter dione is the 15th largest moon in the solar system and is more massive than all known moons smaller than itself combined about two thirds of diones mass is water ice and the remaining is a dense core probably silicate rockdata gathered by cassini indicates that dione has an internal liquid water ocean a situation similar to that of its orbital resonance partner enceladus downward bending of the surface associated with the 1.5 km high ridge janiculum dorsa can most easily be explained by the presence of such an ocean gravity and shape data points to a 99 ± 23 km thick ice shell crust on top of a 65 ± 30 km thick internal liquid water global ocean neither moon has a shape close to hydrostatic equilibrium the deviations are maintained by isostasy diones ice shell is thought to vary in thickness by less than 5 with the thinnest areas at the poles where tidal heating of the crust is greatestthough somewhat smaller and denser dione is otherwise very similar to rhea they both have similar albedo features and varied terrain and both have dissimilar leading and trailing hemispheres diones leading hemisphere is heavily cratered and is uniformly bright its trailing hemisphere however contains an unusual and distinctive surface feature a network of bright ice cliffs
scientists recognise dionean geological features of the following types

chasmata chasms long deep steep-sided depressions
dorsa ridges
fossae long narrow depressions
craters
catenae crater chains


 ice cliffs formerly wispy terrain 

when the voyager space probe photographed dione in 1980 it showed what appeared to be wispy features covering its trailing hemisphere the origin of these features was mysterious because all that was known was that the material has a high albedo and is thin enough that it does not obscure the surface features underneath one hypothesis was that shortly after its formation dione was geologically active and some process such as cryovolcanism resurfaced much of its surface with the streaks forming from eruptions along cracks in diones surface that fell back to the surface as snow or ash later after the internal activity and resurfacing ceased cratering continued primarily on the leading hemisphere and wiped out the streak patterns there
this hypothesis was proven wrong by the cassini probe flyby of december 13 2004 which produced close-up images these revealed that the wisps were in fact not ice deposits at all but rather bright ice cliffs created by tectonic fractures chasmata dione has been revealed as a world riven by enormous fractures on its trailing hemisphere
the cassini orbiter performed a closer flyby of dione at 500 km 310 mi on october 11 2005 and captured oblique images of the cliffs showing that some of them are several hundred metres high


 linear features 
dione features linear virgae that are up to hundreds of km long but less than 5 km wide these lines run parallel to the equator and are only apparent at lower latitudes at less than 45° north or south similar features are noted on rhea they are brighter than everything around them and appear to overlay other features such as ridges and craters indicating they are relatively young it has been proposed that these lines are of exogenic origin as the result of the emplacement of material across the surface by low‐velocity impacts of material sourced from saturns rings co‐orbital moons or closely approaching comets


 craters 

diones icy surface includes heavily cratered terrain moderately cratered plains lightly cratered plains and areas of tectonic fractures the heavily cratered terrain has numerous craters greater than 100 kilometres 62 mi in diameter the plains areas tend to have craters less than 30 kilometres 19 mi in diameter some of the plains are more heavily cratered than others much of the heavily cratered terrain is located on the trailing hemisphere with the less cratered plains areas present on the leading hemisphere this is the opposite of what some scientists expected shoemaker and wolfe proposed a cratering model for a tidally locked satellite with the highest cratering rates on the leading hemisphere and the lowest on the trailing hemisphere this suggests that during the period of heavy bombardment dione was tidally locked to saturn in the opposite orientation because dione is relatively small an impact causing a 35 kilometer crater could have spun the satellite because there are many craters larger than 35 kilometres 22 mi dione could have been repeatedly spun during its early heavy bombardment the pattern of cratering since then and the bright albedo of the leading side suggests that dione has remained in its current orientation for several billion years
like callisto diones craters lack the high-relief features seen on the moon and mercury this is probably due to slumping of the weak icy crust over geologic time


 atmosphere 

on april 7 2010 instruments on board the unmanned cassini probe which flew by dione detected a thin layer of molecular oxygen ions o2 around dione so thin that scientists prefer to call it an exosphere rather than a tenuous atmosphere the density of molecular oxygen ions determined from the cassini plasma spectrometer data ranges from 0.01 to 0.09 per cm3the cassini probe instruments were unable to directly detect water from the exosphere due to high background levels but it seems that highly charged particles from the planets powerful radiation belts could split the water in the ice into hydrogen and oxygen


 exploration 
dione was first imaged by the voyager space probes it has also been probed five times from close distances by the cassini orbiter there was a close targeted flyby at a distance of 500 km 310 mi on 11 october 2005 another flyby was performed on 7 april 2010 also at a distance of 500 km a third flyby was performed on 12 december 2011 at a distance of 99 km 62 mi the following flyby was on 16 june 2015 at a distance of 516 km 321 mi and the last cassini flyby was performed on 17 august 2015 at a distance of 474 km 295 miin may 2013 it was announced that nasas spacecraft cassini had provided scientists with evidence that dione is more active than previously realized using topographic data nasa teams deduced that crustal depression associated with a prominent mountain ridge on the leading hemisphere is best explained if there was a global subsurface liquid ocean like that of enceladus  the ridge janiculum dorsa has a height of 1 to 2 km 0.6 to 1.2 miles diones crust seems to pucker 0.5 km 0.3 miles under it suggesting that the icy crust was warm when the ridge formed probably due to the presence of a subsurface liquid ocean which increases tidal flexing
