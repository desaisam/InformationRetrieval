the jet propulsion laboratory jpl is a federally funded research and development center and nasa field center in la cañada flintridge california united states though it is often referred to as residing in pasadena california because it has a pasadena zip code
founded in the 1930s the jpl is currently owned by nasa and managed by the nearby california institute of technology caltech for nasa the laboratorys primary function is the construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft though it also conducts earth-orbit and astronomy missions it is also responsible for operating nasas deep space network
among the laboratorys major active projects are the mars science laboratory mission which includes the curiosity rover the mars reconnaissance orbiter the juno spacecraft orbiting jupiter the nustar x-ray telescope the smap satellite for earth surface soil moisture monitoring and the spitzer space telescope it is also responsible for managing the jpl small-body database and provides physical data and lists of publications for all known small solar system bodies
the jpls space flight operations facility and twenty-five-foot space simulator are designated national historic landmarks


 history 

jpl traces its beginnings to 1936 in the guggenheim aeronautical laboratory at the california institute of technology galcit when the first set of rocket experiments were carried out in the arroyo seco  caltech graduate students frank malina qian xuesen weld arnold and apollo m o smith along with jack parsons and edward s forman tested a small alcohol-fueled motor to gather data for malinas graduate thesis malinas thesis advisor was engineeraerodynamicist theodore von kármán who eventually arranged for us army financial support for this galcit rocket project in 1939 in 1941 malina parsons forman martin summerfield and pilot homer bushey demonstrated the first jet-assisted takeoff jato rockets to the army in 1943 von kármán malina parsons and forman established the aerojet corporation to manufacture jato rockets the project took on the name jet propulsion laboratory in november 1943 formally becoming an army facility operated under contract by the universityduring jpls army years the laboratory developed two deployed weapon systems the mgm-5 corporal and mgm-29 sergeant intermediate-range ballistic missiles these missiles were the first us ballistic missiles developed at jpl it also developed a number of other weapons system prototypes such as the loki anti-aircraft missile system and the forerunner of the aerobee sounding rocket  at various times it carried out rocket testing at the white sands proving ground edwards air force base and goldstone californiain 1954 jpl teamed up with wernher von brauns engineers at the army ballistic missile agencys redstone arsenal in huntsville alabama to propose orbiting a satellite during the international geophysical year the team lost that proposal to project vanguard and instead embarked on a classified project to demonstrate ablative re-entry technology using a jupiter-c rocket they carried out three successful sub-orbital flights in 1956 and 1957 using a spare juno i a modified jupiter-c with a fourth stage the two organizations then launched the united states first satellite explorer 1 on january 31 1958

jpl was transferred to nasa in december 1958 becoming the agencys primary planetary spacecraft center  jpl engineers designed and operated ranger and surveyor missions to the moon that prepared the way for apollo jpl also led the way in interplanetary exploration with the mariner missions to venus mars and mercury in 1998 jpl opened the near-earth object program office for nasa as of 2013 it has found 95% of asteroids that are a kilometer or more in diameter that cross earths orbitjpl was early to employ female mathematicians in the 1940s and 1950s using mechanical calculators women in an all-female computations group performed trajectory calculations in 1961 jpl hired dana ulery as the first female engineer to work alongside male engineers as part of the ranger and mariner mission tracking teamsjpl has been recognized four times by the space foundation with the douglas s morrow public outreach award which is given annually to an individual or organization that has made significant contributions to public awareness of space programs in 1998 and with the john l jack swigert jr award for space exploration on three occasions – in 2009 as part of nasas phoenix mars lander team 2006 and 2005


 location 

when it was founded jpls site was immediately west of a rocky flood-plain – the arroyo seco riverbed – above the devils gate dam in the northwestern panhandle of the city of pasadena while the first few buildings were constructed in land bought from the city of pasadena subsequent buildings were constructed in neighboring unincorporated land that later became part of la cañada flintridge nowadays most of the 177 acres 72 ha of the us federal government-owned nasa property that makes up the jpl campus is located in la cañada flintridge despite this jpl still uses a pasadena address 4800 oak grove drive pasadena ca 91109 as its official mailing address the city of la cañada flintridge was incorporated in 1976 well after jpl attained international recognition as a pasadena institution there has been occasional rivalry between the two cities over the issue of which one should be mentioned in the media as the home of the laboratory


 employees 

there are approximately 6,000 full-time caltech employees and typically a few thousand additional contractors working on any given day nasa also has a resident office at the facility staffed by federal managers who oversee jpls activities and work for nasa there are also some caltech graduate students college student interns and co-op students


 education 
the jpl education office serves educators and students by providing them with activities resources materials and opportunities tied to nasa missions and science the mission of its programs is to introduce and further students interest in pursuing stem science technology engineering and mathematics careers


 internships and fellowships 
jpl offers research internship and fellowship opportunities in the summer and throughout the year to high school through postdoctoral and faculty students in most cases students must be us citizens or legal permanent residents to apply although foreign nationals studying at us universities are eligible for limited programs interns are sponsored through nasa programs university partnerships and jpl mentors for research opportunities at the laboratory in areas including technology robotics planetary science aerospace engineering and astrophysicsin august 2013 jpl was named one of the 10 most awesome college labs of 2013 by popular science which noted that about 100 students who intern at the laboratory are considered for permanent jobs at jpl after they graduatethe jpl education office also hosts the planetary science summer school psss an annual week-long workshop for graduate and postdoctoral students the program involves a one-week team design exercise developing an early mission concept study working with jpls advanced projects design team team x and other concurrent engineering teams


 museum alliance 
jpl created the nasa museum alliance in 2003 out of a desire to provide museums planetariums visitor centers and other kinds of informal educators with exhibit materials professional development and information related to the then-upcoming landings of the mars rovers spirit and opportunity the alliance now has more than 500 members who get access to nasa displays models educational workshops and networking opportunities through the program staff at educational organizations that meet the museum alliance requirements can register to participate onlinethe museum alliance is a subset of the jpl education offices informal education group which also serves after-school and summer programs parents and other kinds of informal educators


 educator resource center 
the nasajpl educator resource center which is moving from its location at the indian hill mall in pomona calif at the end of 2013 offers resources materials and free workshops for formal and informal educators covering science technology engineering and science topics related to nasa missions and science


 open house 

the lab had an open house once a year on a saturday and sunday in may or june when the public was invited to tour the facilities and see live demonstrations of jpl science and technology  more limited private tours are also available throughout the year if scheduled well in advance  thousands of schoolchildren from southern california and elsewhere visit the lab every year  due to federal spending cuts mandated by budget sequestration the open house has been previously cancelled  jpl open house for 2014 was october 11 and 12 and 2015 was october 10 and 11  starting from 2016 jpl replaced the annual open house with ticket to explore jpl which features the same exhibits but requires tickets and advance reservation roboticist and mars rover driver vandi verma frequently acts as science communicator at open house type events to encourage children and particularly girls into stem careers


 other works 
in addition to its government work jpl has also assisted the nearby motion picture and television industries by advising them about scientific accuracy in their productions science fiction shows advised by jpl include babylon 5 and its sequel series crusade
jpl also works with the department of homeland security science and technology directorate dhsstd jpl and dhsstd developed a search and rescue tool for first responders called finder first responders can use finder to locate people still alive who are buried in rubble after a disaster or terrorist attack finder uses microwave radar to detect breathing and pulses


 funding 
jpl is a federally funded research and development center ffrdc managed and operated by caltech under a contract from nasa in fiscal year 2012 the laboratorys budget was slightly under 1.5 billion with the largest share going to earth science and technology development


 peanuts tradition 
there is a tradition at jpl to eat good luck peanuts before critical mission events such as orbital insertions or landings as the story goes after the ranger program had experienced failure after failure during the 1960s the first successful ranger mission to impact the moon occurred after a jpl staff member had decided to pass out peanuts to relieve tension the staff jokingly decided that the peanuts must have been a good luck charm and the tradition persisted


 missions 
these are some of the missions partially sponsored by jpl

 controversies 


 employee background check lawsuit 

on february 25 2005 homeland security presidential directive 12 was approved by the secretary of commerce this was followed by federal information processing standards 201 fips 201 which specified how the federal government should implement personal identity verification these specifications led to a need for rebadging to meet the updated requirements
on august 30 2007 a group of jpl employees filed suit in federal court against nasa caltech and the department of commerce claiming their constitutional rights were being violated by the new overly invasive background investigations 97% of jpl employees were classified at the low-risk level and would be subjected to the same clearance procedures as those obtaining moderatehigh risk clearance under hspd 12 and fips 201 investigators have the right to obtain any information on employees which includes questioning acquaintances on the status of the employees mental emotional and financial stability additionally if employees depart jpl before the end of the two-year validity of the background check no investigation ability is terminated former employees can still be legally monitored
employees were told that if they did not sign an unlimited waiver of privacy  they would be deemed to have voluntarily resigned the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit found the process violated the employees privacy rights and issued a preliminary injunction nasa appealed and the us supreme court granted certiorari on march 8 2010 on january 19 2011 the supreme court overturned the ninth circuit decision ruling that the background checks did not violate any constitutional privacy right that the employees may have had


 coppedge v jet propulsion laboratory 
on march 12 2012 the los angeles superior court took opening statements on the case in which former jpl employee david coppedge brought suit against the lab due to workplace discrimination and wrongful termination in the suit coppedge alleges that he first lost his team lead status on jpls cassini-huygens mission in 2009 and then was fired in 2011 because of his evangelical christian beliefs and specifically his belief in intelligent design conversely jpl through the caltech lawyers representing the laboratory allege that coppedges termination was simply due to budget cuts and his demotion from team lead was because of harassment complaints and from on-going conflicts with his co-workers superior court judge ernest hiroshige issued a final ruling in favor of jpl on january 16 2013
