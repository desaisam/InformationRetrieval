columbus is a science laboratory that is part of the international space station iss and is the largest single contribution to the iss made by the european space agency esa
like the harmony and tranquility modules the columbus laboratory was constructed in turin italy by thales alenia space the functional equipment and software of the lab was designed by eads in bremen germany it was also integrated in bremen before being flown to the kennedy space center ksc in florida in an airbus beluga it was launched aboard space shuttle atlantis on february 7 2008 on flight sts-122 it is designed for ten years of operation  the module is controlled by the columbus control centre located at the german space operations centre part of the german aerospace center in oberpfaffenhofen near munich germany
the european space agency has spent €1.4 billion about us2 billion on building columbus including the experiments that will fly in it and the ground control infrastructure necessary to operate them


 description 
the laboratory is a cylindrical module with two end cones it is 4,477 mm 14 ft 8.3 in in external diameter and 6,871 mm 22 ft 6.5 in in overall length excluding the projecting external experiment racks its shape is very similar to that of the multi-purpose logistics modules mplms
since both were designed to fit in the cargo bay of a space shuttle orbiter the starboard end cone contains most of the laboratorys on-board computers the port end cone contains the common berthing mechanism


 construction 
esa chose eads astrium space transportation as prime contractor for columbus the columbus flight structure the micro-meteorite protection system the active and passive thermal control the environmental control the harness and all the related ground support equipment were designed and qualified by alcatel alenia space in turin italy as defined by the pica – principle for definition see history below the related hardware was pre-integrated and sent as pica in september 2001 to bremen the lab was then fully integrated and qualified on system level at the eads astrium space transportation facilities in bremen germany


 launch berthing and outfitting 

in november 2007 columbus was moved out of the ksc space station processing facility and installed into the payload bay of the atlantis orbiter for launch on iss assembly flight 1e sts-122during cryo-filling of the space shuttle external tank et with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen prior to the first launch attempt on december 6 2007 two of four lh2 eco sensors failed a test mission rules called for at least three of the four sensors to be in working order for a launch attempt to proceed as a result of the failure the launch director doug lyons postponed the launch initially for 24 hours this was later revised into a 72-hour delay resulting in a next launch attempt set for sunday december 9 2007 this launch attempt was scrubbed when one of the eco sensors again failed during fuelling
the eco sensors external connector was changed on the space shuttle external tank causing a two-month delay in the launch columbus was finally launched successfully on the third attempt at 245pm est february 7 2008
once at the station canadarm2 removed columbus from the docked shuttles cargo bay
and attached it to the starboard hatch of harmony also known as node 2
with the cylinder pointing outwards on february 11 2008


 research activities and payloads 

activities in the lab are controlled on the ground by the columbus control center at dlr oberpfaffenhofen in germany and by the associated user support operations centres throughout europe
the laboratory can accommodate ten active international standard payload racks isprs for science payloads
agreements with nasa allocate to esa 51% usage of the columbus laboratory
esa is thus allocated five active rack locations with the other five being allocated to nasa
four active rack locations are on the forward side of the deck four on the aft side and two are in overhead locations
three of the deck racks are filled with life support and cooling systems
the remaining deck rack and the two remaining overhead racks are storage racks
in addition four un-pressurized payload platforms can be attached outside the starboard cone on the columbus external payload facility cepf each external payload is mounted on an adaptor able to accommodate small instruments and experiments totalling up to 230 kilograms 507 lb

the following european isprs have been initially installed inside columbus

 history 

columbus was originally planned as part of the columbus program an esa program to develop an autonomous manned space station that could be used for a variety of microgravity experiments the program ran from 1986 to 1991 and included three components a man-tended free flyer mtff element  serviced by the hermes shuttle an attached pressurized module apm and a polar platform ppf after several budget cuts and cancellation of hermes shuttle all that remained in the columbus program was the apm finally renamed to columbus
when only the apm was left in the program there were not enough tasks for the two main contributors germany and italy represented by mbb-erno and alenia respectively as compromise the pica pre integrated columbus apm – principle was invented meaning a split responsibility where alenia as a co-prime is responsible for the overall columbus configuration the mechanical and thermallife support systems hfe and harness designmanufacturing whereas eads astrium space transportation is responsible for the overall columbus design and all avionics systems including electrical harness design and software splitting off systems engineering responsibility and harness design under separate fixed-price contracts was found not to be advantageous with respect to efficiency and fast decision making as financial reasonings were pre-dominant in the last phase of development and verification

the structure used  for columbus is based on the mplm module built for nasa by thales alenia space in 2000 the pre-integrated module structure including harness and tubing was delivered to bremen in germany  by the co-prime contractor alenia the final integration and system testing was performed by the overall prime contractor eads astrium space transportation after that the initial payload was integrated and the overall complement checked-out
on may 27 2006 columbus was flown from bremen germany to kennedy space center on board an airbus beluga
the final schedule was much longer than originally planned due to development problems several caused by the complex responsibility splitting between the co-prime and the overall prime contractor and design changes introduced by esa but being affordable due to the shuttle problems delaying the columbus launch for several years the main design change was the addition of the external payload facility epf which was driven by the different european payload organizations being more interested in outer space than internal experiments also the addition of a terminal for direct communications tofrom ground which could have been used also as back-up for the iss system was studied but not implemented for cost reasons
