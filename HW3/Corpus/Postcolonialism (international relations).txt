postcolonial international relations scholarship posits a critical theory approach to international relations ir and is a non-mainstream area of international relations scholarship according to baylis postcolonial international relations scholarship has been largely ignored by mainstream international relations theorists and has only recently begun to make an impact on the discipline postcolonialism focuses on the persistence of colonial forms of power and the continuing existence of racism in world politicspostcolonial ir challenges the eurocentrism of ir—particularly its parochial assumption that western enlightenment thinking is superior progressive and universally applicable  postcolonialists argue that this is enabled through constructing  the other as irrational and backwardspostcolonial ir attempts to expose such parochial assumptions of ir for example in the construction of white versus coloured peoples  an example is the ir story of a white mens burden to educate and liberate coloured men and women to protect coloured women from coloured men  often this is linked to other postpositivist theories for example through postcolonial feminism which analyze issues in ir through the lenses of gender and culture
examples of the parochialistic nature of ir include geographical parochialism and cultural chauvinism  for the former the construction of the cold war era as a time of peace ignores the reality that major conflicts continued in the developing world  furthermore the oft-cited history of ir is constructed in western terms more information under history and ir has been used to justify everything from imperialism to a playground for skirmishes between the two cold war superpowers  for the latter the west through igos such as the imfs quick rush to save asia in the aftermath of the asian financial crisis of 1997–8 could be seen as both a white mens burden to save asia or to reformulate asian capitalism in a western image


 criticisms and defense 
such ir stories are purposefully limited in scope in terms of statecentric modelling cataloguing and predicting in formal terms and like other postpositivist theories they do not attempt to form an overarching theory as after all postpositivism is defined as incredulity towards metanarratives  this is replaced by a sensitivity and openness to the unintended consequences of metanarratives and their negative impacts on the most marginalised actors in ir in defence postpositivists argue that metanarratives have proven unworkable thus such theories although limited in scope provide for much greater possibilities in the normative work of developing an emancipatory politics formulating foreign policy understanding conflict and making peace which takes into account gender ethnicity other identity issues culture methodology and other common issues that have emerged from problem-solving rationalist reductive accounts ir
