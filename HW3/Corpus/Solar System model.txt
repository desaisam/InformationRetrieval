solar system models especially mechanical models called orreries that illustrate the relative positions and motions of the planets and moons in the solar system have been built for centuries while they often showed relative sizes these models were usually not built to scale the enormous ratio of interplanetary distances to planetary diameters makes constructing a scale model of the solar system a challenging task as one example of the difficulty the distance between the earth and the sun is almost 12,000 times the diameter of the earth
if the smaller planets are to be easily visible to the naked eye large outdoor spaces are generally necessary as is some means for highlighting objects that might otherwise not be noticed from a distance the objects in such models do not move traditional orreries often did move and some used clockworks to make the relative speeds of objects accurate these can be thought of as being correctly scaled in time instead of distance


 scale models in various locations 
many towns and institutions have built outdoor scale models of the solar system here is a table comparing these models

several sets of geocaching caches have been laid out as solar system models


 a model based on a classroom globe 
most classroom globes are 41 cm 16 inches in diameter if the earth were reduced to this size the moon would be a 10 cm 4 in baseball floating 12 metres 40 feet away the sun would be a beach ball 14 stories tall somewhat smaller than the spaceship earth ride at epcot floating 5 kilometres 3.1 mi away while a complete model to this scale has never been built a solar system built centered in washington dc london or sydney to that scale approximately 131 000 000 would look like this

if the scale of the above model is increased to 1310 000 000 ie all distances and sizes reduced by a factor of 10 then the earth and venus can be modeled by ping pong balls the moon and smaller planets by various size marbles or lumps of modeling clay the gas giants by balloons or larger playing balls and a circle the diameter of the sun can be drawn on the floor of most classrooms the scale distance to alpha centauri would be 1/3 of the way to the moon
some planetaria and related museums often use this type of scale model of the solar system with a planetarium dome representing the sun examples of this can be seen in planetaria like the adler planetarium and astronomy museum the hayden planetarium at the american museum of natural history the clark planetarium the griffith observatory the louisiana arts and sciences museum the adventure science center etc
