national aerospace development administration nada chosŏngŭl 국가우주개발국 is the official space agency of north korea succeeding the korean committee of space technology it was founded on april 1 2013the current basis for the activities of nada is the law on space development in 2013 the 7th session of the 12th supreme peoples assembly was passed the act sets out the north korean principles of peaceful development of space determines compliance with the principles of the juche ideology north korean ideology and independence as well as the aim of solving scientific and technological problems of space to improve the economy science and technology
the law also regulates the position of the nada and the principles of notification security research and possibly compensation in relation to satellite launches the law calls for cooperation with international organizations and other countries the principle of equality and mutual benefit respect for international law and international regulations for space the law also opposes the militarization of space


 korean committee of space technology 

in 1980 kcst the executive space agency of north korea started research and development with the aim of producing and placing communications satellites earth observation satellites and weather observation satellites


 international legal regime of north koreas space activities 
in 2009 north korea entered to the treaty on principles governing the activities of states in the exploration and use of outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies in and the convention on registration of objects launched into outer space objects


 logo 
the emblem of nada consists of a dark blue globe with the word kukgaujugaebalkuk national space development administration in white korean letters on the bottom dprk democratic peoples republic of korea in light blue letters on the top the constellation of ursa major nada in white letters in the middle and two bright blue rings symbolizing satellite orbits and the intention of place on all orbits of satellites the logo is described as representing the agencys character mission position and development prospect ursa major is intended to symbolize and glorify north korea as a space powerthe western media point out that the logo strikingly resembles to nasas logo — both with blue globes white lettering stars and swooshed rings


 space launch vehicles 


 paektusan-1 

north koreas first orbital space launch vehicle based on the moksong-1 icbm called taepodong-1 in the west


 unha-1 unha-2 unha-3 and kwangmyŏngsŏng unha-4 

designed to compete with south koreas kslv-i
the unha is a north korean family of expendable carrier rockets the unha-1 unha-2 unha-3 and unha-4 kwangmyŏngsŏng partially utilize the same delivery system as the moksong-2 icbm known as taepodong-2 long-range ballistic missile in the west


 unha-9 

designed to compete with south koreas kslv-ii it will be able to place 1 ton into gso
partially utilize the same delivery system as the moksong-3 icbm known as taepodong-3 long-range ballistic missile in the west


 manned unha 

designed to compete with south koreas kslv-iii it will be able to place 8 tons into leo this manned version based on an up-rated unha-9 with additional strap-on boosters would double the liftoff thrust suitable for placing a spacecraft similar to the chinese cz-2f


 unha-20 

designed to compete with south koreas kslv-iv the future unha-20 will be able to place 20 tons into leo


 solid-fuel launcher 
based on the diameter of the flame exhaust bucket of 10m on the tonghae launch complex 3 built and never finished a larger booster with a diameter of 4.5m thus equivalent to the iranian solid propellant qaem is still awaiting its inaugural launch


 launch history 
this is a list of satellites launched


 north koreas deep space exploration program 
designed to compete with south koreas kslv-iv the future unha-20 will be able to place 20 tons into leo it will be used also in the north korean deep space exploration program that includes the moon and mars


 north korean lunar exploration program korean 조선달탐사 朝鮮探月 nklep 


 north korean lunar orbiter 
the first phase of the nklep south korean internet paper jaju minbo carried an article on march 23 2012 that north korea is likely to launch a lunar explorer satellite


 north korean lunar lander 
the second phase of the nklep after orbiting in an interview with the associated press a senior official said on aug 4 2016 that the north koreans will start designing lunar orbiter and lunar lander immediately after launching a geo communication satellite as planned in the second space development five-year plan
the development and completion of the paektusan-1 rocket engine was an epoch-making event that advanced the moon exploration plan
north korea is racing to be in the next 10 years the 7th nation in the world to land a probe on the moon after the united states 1966 the soviet union 1966 japan 1990 the european space agency 2006 india chandrayaan-1s moon impact probe mip crash-landed on the lunar surface on 14 november 2008 and china on 1 march 2009 change 1 crashed onto the surface of the moon


 north korean lunar sample-return mission 
prerequisite paving the way for any manned moon landing the third phase of the nklep after orbiting and landing would be to return rock samples to the earth with a robotic probe
already illustrated back in 2015s pyongyang science-technology complex by a schematics of the orbital trajectory of the north korean lunar exploration program phase iii the lunar sample-return mission 
launched with a heavy unha-20 booster able to place 5t into a lto sometimes after 2026 splash landing of the return capsule in the pacific ocean


 north korean mars exploration program korean 조선화성탐사 朝鮮探火星 nkmep 
hyon kwang il director of the scientific research department of north koreas national aerospace development administration said that north korea also intends to do manned spaceflight and scientific experiments in space make a flight to the moon and moon exploration and also exploration to other planets


 future projects 
in 2016 hyon kwang il director of nadas scientific research department said they planned to launch more satellites before 2020 including a geostationary satellite he also said that he hoped they would plant the flag of the dprk on the moon within 10 yearsin 2017 nada officials unveiled two proposals for upcoming satellites  one of which is an earth remote-exploration satellite weighing in class over 100 kg with spatial resolution of several meters  the second being a satellite with a proposed geostationary orbit for communication with an estimated weight of at least 1 short ton various media outlets have reported that north korea was in the process of completing one of the two satellites dubbed kwangmyongsong-5 however the expected launch date is yet to be determined
