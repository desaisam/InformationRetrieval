a spacecraft is a vehicle or machine designed to fly in outer space spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes including communications earth observation meteorology navigation space colonization planetary exploration and transportation of humans and cargo all spacecraft except single-stage-to-orbit vehicles cannot get into space on their own and require a launch vehicle carrier rocket
on a sub-orbital spaceflight a space vehicle enters space and then returns to the surface without having gone into an orbit for orbital spaceflights spacecraft enter closed orbits around the earth or around other celestial bodies spacecraft used for human spaceflight carry people on board as crew or passengers from start or on orbit space stations only whereas those used for robotic space missions operate either autonomously or telerobotically robotic spacecraft used to support scientific research are space probes robotic spacecraft that remain in orbit around a planetary body are artificial satellites only a handful of interstellar probes such as pioneer 10 and 11 voyager 1 and 2 and new horizons are on trajectories that leave the solar system
orbital spacecraft may be recoverable or not by method of reentry to earth they may be divided in non-winged space capsules and winged spaceplanes

 history 

a german v-2 became the first spacecraft when it reached an altitude of 189 km in june 1944 in peenemünde germany sputnik 1 was the first artificial satellite it was launched into an elliptical low earth orbit leo by the soviet union on 4 october 1957 the launch ushered in new political military technological and scientific developments  while the sputnik launch was a single event it marked the start of the space age apart from its value as a technological first sputnik 1 also helped to identify the upper atmospheric layers density through measuring the satellites orbital changes it also provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere pressurized nitrogen in the satellites false body provided the first opportunity for meteoroid detection sputnik 1 was launched during the international geophysical year from site no1/5 at the 5th tyuratam range in kazakh ssr now at the baikonur cosmodrome the satellite travelled at 29,000 kilometers 18,000 mi per hour taking 96.2 minutes to complete an orbit and emitted radio signals at 20.005 and 40.002 mhz
while sputnik 1 was the first spacecraft to orbit the earth other man-made objects had previously reached an altitude of 100 km which is the height required by the international organization fédération aéronautique internationale to count as a spaceflight this altitude is called the kármán line in particular in the 1940s there were several test launches of the v-2 rocket some of which reached altitudes well over 100 km


 spacecraft types 


 crewed spacecraft 
 

as of 2016 only three nations have flown crewed spacecraft ussrrussia usa and china 
the first crewed spacecraft was vostok 1 which carried soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin into space in 1961 and completed a full earth orbit there were five other crewed missions which used a vostok spacecraft the second crewed spacecraft was named freedom 7 and it performed a sub-orbital spaceflight in 1961 carrying american astronaut alan shepard to an altitude of just over 187 kilometers 116 mi there were five other crewed missions using mercury spacecraft
other soviet crewed spacecraft include the voskhod soyuz flown un crewed as zondl1 l3 tks and the salyut and mir crewed space stations other american crewed spacecraft include the gemini spacecraft apollo spacecraft the skylab space station and the space shuttle with undetached european spacelab and private us spacehab space stations-modules china developed but did not fly shuguang and is currently using shenzhou its first crewed mission was in 2003
except for the space shuttle all of the recoverable crewed orbital spacecraft were space capsules

the international space station crewed since november 2000 is a joint venture between russia the united states canada and several other countries


 spaceplanes 

some reusable vehicles have been designed only for crewed spaceflight and these are often called spaceplanes the first example of such was the north american x-15 spaceplane which conducted two crewed flights which reached an altitude of over 100 km in the 1960s  the first reusable spacecraft the x-15 was air-launched on a suborbital trajectory on july 19 1963
the first partially reusable orbital spacecraft a winged non-capsule the space shuttle was launched by the usa on the 20th anniversary of yuri gagarins flight on april 12 1981 during the shuttle era six orbiters were built all of which have flown in the atmosphere and five of which have flown in space enterprise was used only for approach and landing tests launching from the back of a boeing 747 sca and gliding to deadstick landings at edwards afb california the first space shuttle to fly into space was columbia followed by challenger discovery atlantis and endeavour endeavour was built to replace challenger when it was lost in january 1986 columbia broke up during reentry in february 2003
the first automatic partially reusable spacecraft was the buran-class shuttle launched by the ussr on november 15 1988 although it made only one flight and this was uncrewed this spaceplane was designed for a crew and strongly resembled the us space shuttle although its drop-off boosters used liquid propellants and its main engines were located at the base of what would be the external tank in the american shuttle lack of funding complicated by the dissolution of the ussr prevented any further flights of buran the space shuttle was subsequently modified to allow for autonomous re-entry in case of necessity
per the vision for space exploration the space shuttle was retired in 2011 due mainly to its old age and high cost of program reaching over a billion dollars per flight the shuttles human transport role is to be replaced by spacexs dragon v2 and boeings cst-100 starliner no later than 2017 the shuttles heavy cargo transport role is to be replaced by expendable rockets such as the space launch system and spacexs falcon heavy
scaled composites spaceshipone was a reusable suborbital spaceplane that carried pilots mike melvill and brian binnie on consecutive flights in 2004 to win the ansari x prize the spaceship company will build its successor spaceshiptwo a fleet of spaceshiptwos operated by virgin galactic was planned to begin reusable private spaceflight carrying paying passengers in 2014 but was delayed after the crash of vss enterprise

 subsystems 
a spacecraft system comprises various subsystems depending on the mission profile spacecraft subsystems comprise the spacecrafts bus and may include attitude determination and control variously called adac adc or acs guidance navigation and control gnc or gnc communications comms command and data handling cdh or cdh power eps thermal control tcs propulsion and structures attached to the bus are typically payloads

life support
spacecraft intended for human spaceflight must also include a life support system for the crew
attitude control
a spacecraft needs an attitude control subsystem to be correctly oriented in space and respond to external torques and forces properly the attitude control subsystem consists of sensors and actuators together with controlling algorithms the attitude-control subsystem permits proper pointing for the science objective sun pointing for power to the solar arrays and earth pointing for communicationsgnc
guidance refers to the calculation of the commands usually done by the cdh subsystem needed to steer the spacecraft where it is desired to be navigation means determining a spacecrafts orbital elements or position control means adjusting the path of the spacecraft to meet mission requirementscommand and data handling
the cdh subsystem receives commands from the communications subsystem performs validation and decoding of the commands and distributes the commands to the appropriate spacecraft subsystems and components the cdh also receives housekeeping data and science data from the other spacecraft subsystems and components and packages the data for storage on a data recorder or transmission to the ground via the communications subsystem other functions of the cdh include maintaining the spacecraft clock and state-of-health monitoring
communications
spacecraft both robotic and crewed utilize various communications systems for communication with terrestrial stations as well as for communication between spacecraft in space technologies utilized include rf and optical communication in addition some spacecraft payloads are explicitly for the purpose of ground–ground communication using receiverretransmitter electronic technologiespower
spacecraft need an electrical power generation and distribution subsystem for powering the various spacecraft subsystems for spacecraft near the sun solar panels are frequently used to generate electrical power spacecraft designed to operate in more distant locations for example jupiter might employ a radioisotope thermoelectric generator rtg to generate electrical power electrical power is sent through power conditioning equipment before it passes through a power distribution unit over an electrical bus to other spacecraft components batteries are typically connected to the bus via a battery charge regulator and the batteries are used to provide electrical power during periods when primary power is not available for example when a low earth orbit spacecraft is eclipsed by earththermal control
spacecraft must be engineered to withstand transit through earths atmosphere and the space environment they must operate in a vacuum with temperatures potentially ranging across hundreds of degrees celsius as well as if subject to reentry in the presence of plasmas material requirements are such that either high melting temperature low density materials such as beryllium and reinforced carbon–carbon or possibly due to the lower thickness requirements despite its high density tungsten or ablative carbon–carbon composites are used depending on mission profile spacecraft may also need to operate on the surface of another planetary body the thermal control subsystem can be passive dependent on the selection of materials with specific radiative properties active thermal control makes use of electrical heaters and certain actuators such as louvers to control temperature ranges of equipments within specific rangesspacecraft propulsion
spacecraft may or may not have a propulsion subsystem depending on whether or not the mission profile calls for propulsion the swift spacecraft is an example of a spacecraft that does not have a propulsion subsystem typically though leo spacecraft include a propulsion subsystem for altitude adjustments drag make-up maneuvers and inclination adjustment maneuvers a propulsion system is also needed for spacecraft that perform momentum management maneuvers components of a conventional propulsion subsystem include fuel tankage valves pipes and thrusters the thermal control system interfaces with the propulsion subsystem by monitoring the temperature of those components and by preheating tanks and thrusters in preparation for a spacecraft maneuverstructures
spacecraft must be engineered to withstand launch loads imparted by the launch vehicle and must have a point of attachment for all the other subsystems depending on mission profile the structural subsystem might need to withstand loads imparted by entry into the atmosphere of another planetary body and landing on the surface of another planetary bodypayload
the payload depends on the mission of the spacecraft and is typically regarded as the part of the spacecraft that pays the bills typical payloads could include scientific instruments cameras telescopes or particle detectors for example cargo or a human crewground segment
the ground segment though not technically part of the spacecraft is vital to the operation of the spacecraft typical components of a ground segment in use during normal operations include a mission operations facility where the flight operations team conducts the operations of the spacecraft a data processing and storage facility ground stations to radiate signals to and receive signals from the spacecraft and a voice and data communications network to connect all mission elementslaunch vehicle
the launch vehicle propels the spacecraft from earths surface through the atmosphere and into an orbit the exact orbit being dependent on the mission configuration the launch vehicle may be expendable or reusable
