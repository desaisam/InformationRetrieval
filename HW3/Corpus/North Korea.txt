 etymology 

the name korea derives from the name goryeo also spelled koryŏ the name goryeo itself was first used by the ancient kingdom of goguryeo koguryŏ in the 5th century as a shortened form of its name the 10th-century kingdom of goryeo succeeded goguryeo and thus inherited its name which was pronounced by visiting persian merchants as korea the modern spelling of korea first appeared in the late 17th century in the travel writings of the dutch east india companys hendrick hamelafter the division of the country into north and south korea the two sides used different terms to refer to korea chosun or joseon 조선 in north korea and hanguk 한국 in south korea in 1948 north korea adopted democratic peoples republic of korea chosŏngŭl 조선민주주의인민공화국 hancha 朝鮮民主主義人民共和國 mr chosŏn minjujuŭi inmin konghwaguk listen as its new legal name in the wider world because the government controls the northern part of the korean peninsula it is commonly called north korea to distinguish it from south korea which is officially called the republic of korea in english  both governments consider themselves to be the legitimate government of the whole of korea for this reason the people do not consider themselves as north koreans but as koreans in the same divided country as their compatriots in the south and foreign visitors are discouraged from using the former term


 history 


 japanese occupation 1910–1945 

after the first sino-japanese war and the russo-japanese war korea was occupied by japan from 1910 to 1945
japan tried to suppress korean traditions and culture and ran the economy primarily for its own benefit korean resistance groups known as dongnipgun liberation army operated along the sino-korean border fighting guerrilla warfare against japanese forces some of them took part in allied action in china and parts of south east asia one of the guerrilla leaders was the communist kim il-sung who later became the first leader of north korea


 division of korea 1945–1950 

at the end of world war ii in 1945 the korean peninsula was divided into two zones along the 38th parallel with the northern half of the peninsula occupied by the soviet union and the southern half by the united states the drawing of the division was assigned to two american officers diplomat dean rusk and army officer charles bonesteel who chose the 38th parallel because it divided the country approximately in half but would place the capital seoul under us control no experts on korea were consulted nevertheless the division was immediately accepted by the soviet union the agreement was incorporated into the uss general order no 1 for the surrender of japan initial hopes for a unified independent korea had evaporated as the politics of the cold war resulted in the establishment of two separate states with diametrically opposed political economic and social systems
soviet general terentii shtykov recommended the establishment of the soviet civil authority in october 1945 and supported kim il-sung as chairman of the provisional peoples committee for north korea established in february 1946 during the provisional government shtykovs chief accomplishment was a sweeping land reform program that broke north koreas stratified class system landlords and japanese collaborators fled to the south where there was no land reform and sporadic unrest shtykov nationalized key industries and led the soviet delegation to talks on the future of korea in moscow and seoul in september 1946 south korean citizens rose up against the allied military government in april 1948 an uprising of the jeju islanders was violently crushed the south declared its statehood in may 1948 and two months later the ardent anti-communist syngman rhee became its ruler the democratic peoples republic of korea was established in the north on 9 september 1948 shtykov served as the first soviet ambassador while kim il-sung became premier
soviet forces withdrew from the north in 1948 and most american forces withdrew from the south in 1949 ambassador shtykov suspected rhee was planning to invade the north and was sympathetic to kims goal of korean unification under socialism the two successfully lobbied joseph stalin to support a quick war against the south which culminated in the outbreak of the korean war


 korean war 1950–1953 

the military of north korea invaded the south on 25 june 1950 and swiftly overran most of the country a united nations force led by the united states intervened to defend the south and rapidly advanced into north korea as they neared the border with china chinese forces intervened on behalf of north korea shifting the balance of the war again fighting ended on 27 july 1953 with an armistice that approximately restored the original boundaries between north and south korea more than one million civilians and soldiers were killed in the war as a result of the war almost every substantial building in north korea was destroyedsome have referred to the conflict as a civil war with other factors involveda heavily guarded demilitarized zone dmz still divides the peninsula and an anti-communist and anti-north korea sentiment remains in south korea since the war the united states has maintained a strong military presence in the south which is depicted by the north korean government as an imperialist occupation force it claims that the korean war was caused by the united states and south korea


 post-war developments 

the relative peace between the south and the north following the armistice was interrupted by border skirmishes celebrity abductions and assassination attempts the north failed in several assassination attempts on south korean leaders such as in 1968 1974 and the rangoon bombing in 1983 tunnels were found under the dmz and tensions flared over the axe murder incident at panmunjom in 1976 for almost two decades after the war the two states did not seek to negotiate with one another in 1971 secret high-level contacts began to be conducted culminating in the 1972 july 4th north–south joint statement that established principles of working toward peaceful reunification the talks ultimately failed because in 1973 south korea declared its preference that the two koreas should seek separate memberships in international organizations

during the 1956 august faction incident kim il-sung successfully resisted efforts by the soviet union and china to depose him in favor of soviet koreans or the pro-chinese yanan faction the last chinese troops withdrew from the country in october 1958 which is the consensus as the latest date when north korea became effectively independent some scholars believe that the 1956 august incident demonstrated independence north korea remained closely aligned with china and the soviet union and the sino-soviet split allowed kim to play the powers off each other north korea sought to become a leader of the non-aligned movement and emphasized the ideology of juche to distinguish it from both the soviet union and chinarecovery from the war was quick—by 1957 industrial production reached 1949 levels in 1959 relations with japan had improved somewhat and north korea began allowing the repatriation of japanese citizens in the country the same year north korea revalued the north korean won which held greater value than its south korean counterpart until the 1960s economic growth was higher than in south korea and north korean gdp per capita was equal to that of its southern neighbor as late as 1976by the 1980s the economy had begun to stagnate it started its long decline in 1987 and almost completely collapsed after the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 when all soviet aid was suddenly halted the north began reestablishing trade relations with china shortly thereafter but the chinese could not afford to provide enough food aid to meet demand


 post cold war 

in 1992 as kim il-sungs health began deteriorating kim jong-il slowly began taking over various state tasks kim il-sung died of a heart attack in 1994 in the midst of a standoff with the united states over north korean nuclear weapon development kim jong-il declared a three-year period of national mourning before officially announcing his position as the new leader
north korea promised to halt its development of nuclear weapons under the agreed framework negotiated with us president bill clinton and signed in 1994 building on nordpolitik south korea began to engage with the north as part of its sunshine policykim jong-il instituted a policy called songun or military first there is much speculation about this policy being used as a strategy to strengthen the military while discouraging coup attempts restrictions on travel were tightened and the state security apparatus was strengthenedflooding in the mid-1990s exacerbated the economic crisis severely damaging crops and infrastructure and led to widespread famine which the government proved incapable of curtailing in 1996 the government accepted un food aid since the outbreak of the famine the government has reluctantly tolerated illegal black markets while officially maintaining a state socialist economy corruption flourished and disillusionment with the government spread


 21st century 

the international environment changed with the election of us president george w bush in 2001 his administration rejected south koreas sunshine policy and the agreed framework the us government treated north korea as a rogue state while north korea redoubled its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons to avoid the fate of iraq on 9 october 2006 north korea announced it had conducted its first nuclear weapons testus president barack obama adopted a policy of strategic patience resisting making deals with north korea for the sake of defusing tension tensions with south korea and the united states increased in 2010 with the sinking of the south korean warship cheonan and north koreas shelling of yeonpyeong islandon 17 december 2011 the supreme leader of north korea kim jong-il died from a heart attack his youngest son kim jong-un was announced as his successor in the face of international condemnation north korea continued to develop its nuclear arsenal possibly including a hydrogen bomb and a missile capable of reaching the united statesthroughout 2017 following donald trumps assumption of the us presidency tensions between the united states and north korea increased and there was heightened rhetoric between the two with trump threatening fire and fury  and north korea threatening to launch missiles towards guamin 2018 a détente developed on 27 april a 2018 inter-korean summit took place between president moon jae-in of south korea and kim on the south korean side of the joint security area it was the first time since the korean war that a north korean leader had entered south korean territory on 12 june 2018 the first meeting between north koreas leader kim jong-un and us president donald trump occurred in singapore in september at a summit with moon in pyongyang kim agreed to dismantle north koreas nuclear weapons facilities if the united states took reciprocal action

 administrative divisions 


 government and politics 

north korea functions as a highly centralized one-party state according to its 2016 constitution it is a self-described revolutionary and socialist state guided in its activities by the juche idea and the songun idea in addition to the constitution north korea is governed by the ten principles for the establishment of a monolithic ideological system also known as the ten principles of the one-ideology system which establishes standards for governance and a guide for the behaviours of north koreans the workers party of korea wpk has an estimated 3,000,000 members and dominates every aspect of north korean politics it has two satellite organizations the korean social democratic party and the chondoist chongu party which participate in the wpk-led democratic front for the reunification of the fatherland

legislative power is held by the unicameral supreme peoples assembly spa its 687 members are elected every five years by universal suffrage supreme peoples assembly sessions are convened by the spa presidium whose president kim yong-nam since 1998 represents the state in relations with foreign countries deputies formally elect the president the vice-presidents and members of the presidium and take part in the constitutionally appointed activities of the legislature pass laws establish domestic and foreign policies appoint members of the cabinet review and approve the state economic plan among others the spa itself cannot initiate any legislation independently of party or state organs it is unknown whether it has ever criticized or amended bills placed before it and the elections are based around a single list of wpk-approved candidates who stand without oppositionexecutive power is vested in the cabinet of north korea which is headed by premier pak pong-ju the premier represents the government and functions independently his authority extends over two vice-premiers 30 ministers two cabinet commission chairmen the cabinet chief secretary the president of the central bank the director of the central bureau of statistics and the president of the academy of sciences a 31st ministry the ministry of peoples armed forces is under the jurisdiction of the state affairs commissiondespite its official title as the democratic peoples republic of korea dprk some observers have described north koreas political system as an absolute monarchy or a hereditary dictatorship


 political ideology 

the juche ideology is the cornerstone of party works and government operations it is viewed by the official north korean line as an embodiment of kim il-sungs wisdom an expression of his leadership and an idea which provides a complete answer to any question that arises in the struggle for national liberation juche was pronounced in december 1955 in order to emphasize a korea-centered revolution its core tenets are economic self-sufficiency military self-reliance and an independent foreign policy the roots of juche were made up of a complex mixture of factors including the cult of personality centered on kim il-sung the conflict with pro-soviet and pro-chinese dissenters and koreas centuries-long struggle for independencejuche was initially promoted as a creative application of marxism–leninism but in the mid-1970s it was described by state propaganda as the only scientific thought and most effective revolutionary theoretical structure that leads to the future of communist society juche eventually replaced marxism–leninism entirely by the 1980s and in 1992 references to the latter were omitted from the constitution the 2009 constitution dropped references to communism and elevated the songun military-first policy while explicitly confirming the position of kim jong-il however the constitution retains references to socialism juches concepts of self-reliance have evolved with time and circumstances but still provide the groundwork for the spartan austerity sacrifice and discipline demanded by the partyscholar brian reynolds myers views north koreas actual ideology as a korean ethnic nationalism similar to statism in shōwa japan and european fascism


 kim dynasty 

north korea is ruled by the kim dynasty which in north korea is referred to as the mount paektu bloodline it is a three-generation lineage descending from the countrys first leader kim il-sung since 1948 kim developed a cult of personality closely tied to the state philosophy of juche which was later passed on to his successors his son kim jong-il and grandson kim jong-un in 2013 this lineage was made explicit when clause 2 of article 10 of the new edited ten fundamental principles of the korean workers party stated that the party and revolution must be carried eternally by the baekdu bloodlineaccording to new focus international the cult of personality particularly surrounding kim il-sung has been crucial for legitimizing the familys hereditary succession the control the north korean government exercises over many aspects of the nations culture is used to perpetuate the cult of personality surrounding kim il-sung and kim jong-il while visiting north korea in 1979 journalist bradley martin wrote that nearly all music art and sculpture that he observed glorified great leader kim il-sung whose personality cult was then being extended to his son dear leader kim jong-ilclaims that the dynasty has been deified are contested by north korea researcher b r myers divine powers have never been attributed to either of the two kims in fact the propaganda apparatus in pyongyang has generally been careful not to make claims that run directly counter to citizens experience or common sense he further explains that the state propaganda painted kim jong-il as someone whose expertise lay in military matters and that the famine of the 1990s was partially caused by natural disasters out of kim jong-ils control

the song no motherland without you sung by the north korean army choir was created especially for kim jong-il and is one of the most popular tunes in the country kim il-sung is still officially revered as the nations eternal president several landmarks in north korea are named for kim il-sung including kim il-sung university kim il-sung stadium and kim il-sung square defectors have been quoted as saying that north korean schools deify both father and son kim il-sung rejected the notion that he had created a cult around himself and accused those who suggested this of factionalism following the death of kim il-sung north koreans were prostrating and weeping to a bronze statue of him in an organized event similar scenes were broadcast by state television following the death of kim jong-ilcritics maintain that kim jong-ils personality cult was inherited from his father kim jong-il was often the center of attention throughout ordinary life his birthday is one of the most important public holidays in the country on his 60th birthday based on his official date of birth mass celebrations occurred throughout the country kim jong-ils personality cult although significant was not as extensive as his fathers one point of view is that kim jong-ils cult of personality was solely out of respect for kim il-sung or out of fear of punishment for failure to pay homage while north korean government sources consider it genuine hero worshipthe extent of the cult of personality surrounding kim jong-il and kim il-sung was illustrated on 11 june 2012 when a 14-year-old north korean schoolgirl drowned while attempting to rescue portraits of the two from a flood


 foreign relations 

as a result of its isolation north korea is sometimes known as the hermit kingdom a term that originally referred to the isolationism in the latter part of the joseon dynasty initially north korea had diplomatic ties with only other communist countries and even today most of the foreign embassies accredited to north korea are located in beijing rather than in pyongyang in the 1960s and 1970s it pursued an independent foreign policy established relations with many developing countries and joined the non-aligned movement in the late 1980s and the 1990s its foreign policy was thrown into turmoil with the collapse of the soviet bloc suffering an economic crisis it closed a number of its embassies at the same time north korea sought to build relations with developed free market countriesas of  2015 north korea had diplomatic relations with 166 countries and embassies in 47 countries however owing to the human rights and political situation the dprk is not recognised by argentina botswana estonia france iraq israel japan taiwan and the united states this means that in september 2017 france and estonia are the last two european countries that do not have an official relationship with north korea north korea continues to have strong ties with its socialist southeast asian allies in vietnam and laos as well as with cambodia

as a result of the north korean nuclear weapons program the six-party talks were established to find a peaceful solution to the growing tension between the two korean governments russia china japan and the united states the talks were discontinued in 2009 north korea was previously designated a state sponsor of terrorism because of its alleged involvement in the 1983 rangoon bombing and the 1987 bombing of a south korean airliner on 11 october 2008 the united states removed north korea from its list of states that sponsor terrorism after pyongyang agreed to cooperate on issues related to its nuclear program north korea was re-designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the us under the trump administration on 20 november 2017 9 years after it was removed from the list the kidnapping of at least 13 japanese citizens by north korean agents in the 1970s and the 1980s has affected north koreas relationship with japan


 inter-korean relations 

the korean demilitarized zone with south korea remains the most heavily fortified border in the world inter-korean relations are at the core of north korean diplomacy and have seen numerous shifts in the last few decades north koreas policy is to seek reunification without what it sees as outside interference through a federal structure retaining each sides leadership and systems in 1972 the two koreas agreed in principle to achieve reunification through peaceful means and without foreign interference on 10 october 1980 then north korean president kim il-sung proposed a federation between north and south korea named the democratic federal republic of korea in which the respective political systems would initially remain however relations remained cool well until the early 1990s with a brief period in the early 1980s when north korea offered to provide flood relief to its southern neighbor although the offer was initially welcomed talks over how to deliver the relief goods broke down and none of the promised aid ever crossed the border
the two countries also organized a reunion of 92 separated families

the sunshine policy instituted by south korean president kim dae-jung in 1998 was a watershed in inter-korean relations it encouraged other countries to engage with the north which allowed pyongyang to normalize relations with a number of european union states and contributed to the establishment of joint north-south economic projects the culmination of the sunshine policy was the 2000 inter-korean summit when kim dae-jung visited kim jong-il in pyongyang both north and south korea signed the june 15th north–south joint declaration in which both sides promised to seek peaceful reunification on 4 october 2007 south korean president roh moo-hyun and kim jong-il signed an eight-point peace agreement
however relations worsened in the late 2000s and early 2010s when south korean president lee myung-bak adopted a more hard-line approach and suspended aid deliveries pending the de-nuclearization of the north north korea responded by ending all of its previous agreements with the south it deployed additional ballistic missiles and placed its military on full combat alert after south korea japan and the united states threatened to intercept a unha-2 space launch vehicle the next few years witnessed a string of hostilities including the alleged north korean involvement in the sinking of south korean warship cheonan mutual ending of diplomatic ties a north korean artillery attack on yeonpyeong island and growing international concern over north koreas nuclear program in 2018 a détente developed at the winter olympics in the southin september 2018 at a joint news conference in pyongyang moon jae-in and kim jong un agreed upon turning the korean peninsula into a land of peace without nuclear weapons and nuclear threats kim also said that he will visit seoul by the end of the year this would be the first-ever visit by a north korean leader to the capital city of the south


 human rights 

north korea is widely accused of having perhaps the worst human rights record in the world north koreans have been referred to as some of the worlds most brutalized people by human rights watch because of the severe restrictions placed on their political and economic freedoms the north korean population is strictly managed by the state and all aspects of daily life are subordinated to party and state planning employment is managed by the party on the basis of political reliability and travel is tightly controlled by the ministry of peoples securityamnesty international reports of severe restrictions on the freedom of association expression and movement arbitrary detention torture and other ill-treatment resulting in death and executionsthe state security department extrajudicially apprehends and imprisons those accused of political crimes without due process people perceived as hostile to the government such as christians or critics of the leadership are deported to labor camps without trial often with their whole family and mostly without any chance of being releasedbased on satellite images and defector testimonies amnesty international estimates that around 200,000 prisoners are held in six large political prison camps where they are forced to work in conditions approaching slavery supporters of the government who deviate from the government line are subject to reeducation in sections of labor camps set aside for that purpose those who are deemed politically rehabilitated may reassume responsible government positions on their releasenorth korean defectors have provided detailed testimonies on the existence of the total control zones where abuses such as torture starvation rape murder medical experimentation forced labor and forced abortions have been reported on the basis of these abuses as well as persecution on political religious racial and gender grounds forcible transfer of populations enforced disappearance of persons and forced starvation the united nations commission of inquiry has accused north korea of crimes against humanity the international coalition to stop crimes against humanity in north korea icnk estimates that over 10,000 people die in north korean prison camps every yearaccording to human rights watch north korean women are routinely subjected to sexual violence unwanted sexual contact and rape men in positions of power including police high-ranking officials market supervisors and guards can abuse women at will and are not prosecuted for it it happens so often that it is accepted as a routine part of life women assume they cant do anything about it the only ones with protection are those whose husbands or fathers are themselves in positions of powerthe north korean government rejects the human rights abuse claims calling them a smear campaign and a human rights racket aimed at government change in a 2014 report to the un north korea dismissed accusations of atrocities as wild rumors the official state media kcna responded with an article that included homophobic insults against the author of the human rights report michael kirby calling him a disgusting old lecher with a 40-odd-year-long career of homosexuality   this practice can never be found in the dprk boasting of the sound mentality and good morals  in fact it is ridiculous for such gay  sic to sponsor dealing with others human rights issue the government however admitted some human rights issues related to living conditions and stated that it is working to improve them


 law enforcement and internal security 

north korea has a civil law system based on the prussian model and influenced by japanese traditions and communist legal theory judiciary procedures are handled by the supreme court the highest court of appeal provincial or special city-level courts peoples courts and special courts peoples courts are at the lowest level of the system and operate in cities counties and urban districts while different kinds of special courts handle cases related to military railroad or maritime mattersjudges are theoretically elected by their respective local peoples assemblies but in practice they are appointed by the workers party of korea the penal code is based on the principle of nullum crimen sine lege no crime without a law but remains a tool for political control despite several amendments reducing ideological influence courts carry out legal procedures related to not only criminal and civil matters but also political cases as well political prisoners are sent to labor camps while criminal offenders are incarcerated in a separate systemthe ministry of peoples security mps maintains most law enforcement activities it is one of the most powerful state institutions in north korea and oversees the national police force investigates criminal cases and manages non-political correctional facilities it handles other aspects of domestic security like civil registration traffic control fire departments and railroad security the state security department was separated from the mps in 1973 to conduct domestic and foreign intelligence counterintelligence and manage the political prison system political camps can be short-term reeducation zones or kwalliso total control zones for lifetime detention camp 15 in yodok and camp 18 in bukchang have been described in detailed testimoniesthe security apparatus is very extensive exerting strict control over residence travel employment clothing food and family life security forces employ mass surveillance it is believed they tightly monitor cellular and digital communications

the korean peoples army kpa is north koreas military organization the kpa has 1,106,000 active and 8,389,000 reserve and paramilitary troops making it the largest military institution in the world about 20 percent of men aged 17–54 serve in the regular armed forces and approximately one in every 25 citizens is an enlisted soldier the kpa has five branches ground force navy air force special operations force and rocket force command of the korean peoples army lies in both the central military commission of the workers party of korea and the independent state affairs commission the ministry of peoples armed forces is subordinated to the latterof all kpa branches the ground force is the largest it has approximately one million personnel divided into 80 infantry divisions 30 artillery brigades 25 special warfare brigades 20 mechanized brigades 10 tank brigades and seven tank regiments they are equipped with 3,700 tanks 2,100 armoured personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles 17,900 artillery pieces 11,000 anti-aircraft guns and some 10,000 manpads and anti-tank guided missiles other equipment includes 1,600 aircraft in the air force and 1,000 vessels in the navy north korea has the largest special forces and the largest submarine fleet in the world

north korea possesses nuclear weapons but the strength of its arsenal is uncertain in january 2018 estimates of north koreas nuclear arsenal ranged between 15 and 60 bombs probably including hydrogen bombs delivery capabilities are provided by the rocket force which has some 1,000 ballistic missiles with a range of up to 7,400 miles 11,900 kmaccording to a 2004 south korean assessment north korea possesses a stockpile of chemical weapons estimated to amount to 2,500–5,000 tons including nerve blister blood and vomiting agents as well as the ability to cultivate and produce biological weapons including anthrax smallpox and cholera because of its nuclear and missile tests north korea has been sanctioned under united nations security council resolutions 1695 of july 2006 1718 of october 2006 1874 of june 2009 2087 of january 2013 and 2397 in december 2017
the military faces some issues limiting its conventional capabilities including obsolete equipment insufficient fuel supplies and a shortage of digital command and control assets due to other countries being banned from selling weapons to it by the un sanctions to compensate for these deficiencies the kpa has deployed a wide range of asymmetric warfare technologies like anti-personnel blinding lasers gps jammers midget submarines and human torpedoes stealth paint electromagnetic pulse bombs and cyberwarfare units in 2015 north korea was estimated as having 6,000 sophisticated computer security personnel kpa units have allegedly attempted to jam south korean military satellitesmuch of the equipment is engineered and produced by a domestic defense industry weapons are manufactured in roughly 1,800 underground defense industry plants scattered throughout the country most of them located in chagang province the defense industry is capable of producing a full range of individual and crew-served weapons artillery armored vehicles tanks missiles helicopters surface combatants submarines landing and infiltration craft yak-18 trainers and possibly co-production of jet aircraft according to official north korean media military expenditures for 2010 amount to 15.8 percent of the state budget the us state department has estimated that north koreas military spending averaged 23% of its gdp from 2004 to 2014 the highest level in the world

with the exception of a small chinese community and a few ethnic japanese north koreas 25,368,620 people are ethnically homogeneous demographic experts in the 20th century estimated that the population would grow to 25.5 million by 2000 and 28 million by 2010 but this increase never occurred due to the north korean famine it began in 1995 lasted for three years and resulted in the deaths of between 240,000 and 420,000 north koreansinternational donors led by the united states initiated shipments of food through the world food program in 1997 to combat the famine despite a drastic reduction of aid under the george w bush administration the situation gradually improved the number of malnourished children declined from 60% in 1998 to 37% in 2006 and 28% in 2013 domestic food production almost recovered to the recommended annual level of 5.37 million tons of cereal equivalent in 2013 but the world food program reported a continuing lack of dietary diversity and access to fats and proteinsthe famine had a significant impact on the population growth rate which declined to 0.9% annually in 2002 it was 0.53% in 2014 late marriages after military service limited housing space and long hours of work or political studies further exhaust the population and reduce growth the national birth rate is 14.5 births per year per 1,000 population two-thirds of households consist of extended families mostly living in two-room units marriage is virtually universal and divorce is extremely rare


 health 

north korea had a life expectancy of 69.8 years in 2013 while north korea is classified as a low-income country the structure of north koreas causes of death 2013 is unlike that of other low-income countries instead it is closer to worldwide averages with non-communicable diseases—such as cardiovascular disease and cancers—accounting for two-thirds of the total deathsa 2013 study reported that communicable diseases and malnutrition are responsible for 29% of the total deaths in north korea this figure is higher than those of high-income countries and south korea but half of the average 57% of all deaths in other low-income countries in 2003 infectious diseases like tuberculosis malaria and hepatitis b were described as endemic to the country as a result of the famine however in 2013 they were reported to be in declinein 2013 cardiovascular disease as a single disease group was reported as the largest cause of death in north korea the three major causes of death in dpr korea are ischaemic heart disease 13 lower respiratory infections 11 and cerebrovascular disease 7 non-communicable diseases risk factors in north korea include high rates of urbanisation an aging society and high rates of smoking and alcohol consumption amongst menaccording to a 2003 report by the united states department of state almost 100% of the population has access to water and sanitation 80% of the population had access to improved sanitation facilities in 2015a free universal insurance system is in place quality of medical care varies significantly by region and is often low with severe shortages of equipment drugs and anaesthetics according to who expenditure on health per capita is one of the lowest in the world preventive medicine is emphasized through physical exercise and sports nationwide monthly checkups and routine spraying of public places against disease every individual has a lifetime health card which contains a full medical record


 education 

the 2008 census listed the entire population as literate an 11-year free compulsory cycle of primary and secondary education is provided in more than 27,000 nursery schools 14,000 kindergartens 4,800 four-year primary and 4,700 six-year secondary schools 77% of males and 79% of females aged 30–34 have finished secondary school an additional 300 universities and colleges offer higher educationmost graduates from the compulsory program do not attend university but begin their obligatory military service or proceed to work in farms or factories instead the main deficiencies of higher education are the heavy presence of ideological subjects which comprise 50% of courses in social studies and 20% in sciences and the imbalances in curriculum the study of natural sciences is greatly emphasized while social sciences are neglected heuristics is actively applied to develop the independence and creativity of students throughout the system the study of russian and english was made compulsory in upper middle schools in 1978


 language 

north korea shares the korean language with south korea although some dialectal differences exist within both koreas north koreans refer to their pyongyang dialect as munhwaŏ cultured language as opposed to the dialects of south korea especially the seoul dialect or pyojunŏ standard language which are viewed as decadent because of its use of  loanwords from chinese and european languages particularly english words of chinese manchu or western origin have been eliminated from munhwa along with the usage of chinese hancha characters written language uses only the chosŏngŭl phonetic alphabet developed under sejong the great 1418–1450


 religion 

there are no known official statistics of religions in north korea according to religious intelligence 64.3% of the population are irreligious 16% practice korean shamanism 13.5% practice chondoism 4.5% are buddhist and 1.7% are christian freedom of religion and the right to religious ceremonies are constitutionally guaranteed but religions are restricted by the government amnesty international has expressed concerns about religious persecution in north koreathe influence of buddhism and confucianism still has an effect on cultural life chondoism heavenly way is an indigenous syncretic belief combining elements of korean shamanism buddhism taoism and catholicism that is officially represented by the wpk-controlled chongu partythe open doors mission a protestant-group based in the united states and founded during the cold war-era claims the most severe persecution of christians in the world occurs in north korea four state-sanctioned churches exist but critics claim these are showcases for foreigners


 formal ranking of citizens loyalty 

according to north korean documents and refugee testimonies all north koreans are sorted into groups according to their songbun an ascribed status system based on a citizens assessed loyalty to the government based on their own behavior and the political social and economic background of their family for three generations as well as behavior by relatives within that range songbun is allegedly used to determine whether an individual is trusted with responsibility given opportunities or even receives adequate foodsongbun allegedly affects access to educational and employment opportunities and particularly whether a person is eligible to join north koreas ruling party there are 3 main classifications and about 50 sub-classifications according to kim il-sung speaking in 1958 the loyal core class constituted 25% of the north korean population the wavering class 55 and the hostile class 20 the highest status is accorded to individuals descended from those who participated with kim il-sung in the resistance against japanese occupation during and before world war ii and to those who were factory workers laborers or peasants in 1950while some analysts believe private commerce recently changed the songbun system to some extent most north korean refugees say it remains a commanding presence in everyday life the north korean government claims all citizens are equal and denies any discrimination on the basis of family background


 economy 

north korea has maintained one of the most closed and centralized economies in the world since the 1940s for several decades it followed the soviet pattern of five-year plans with the ultimate goal of achieving self-sufficiency extensive soviet and chinese support allowed north korea to rapidly recover from the korean war and register very high growth rates systematic inefficiency began to arise around 1960 when the economy shifted from the extensive to the intensive development stage the shortage of skilled labor energy arable land and transportation significantly impeded long-term growth and resulted in consistent failure to meet planning objectives the major slowdown of the economy contrasted with south korea which surpassed the north in terms of absolute gdp and per capita income by the 1980s north korea declared the last seven-year plan unsuccessful in december 1993 and thereafter stopped announcing plans

the loss of eastern bloc trading partners and a series of natural disasters throughout the 1990s caused severe hardships including widespread famine by 2000 the situation improved owing to a massive international food assistance effort but the economy continues to suffer from food shortages dilapidated infrastructure and a critically low energy supply in an attempt to recover from the collapse the government began structural reforms in 1998 that formally legalized private ownership of assets and decentralized control over production a second round of reforms in 2002 led to an expansion of market activities partial monetization flexible prices and salaries and the introduction of incentives and accountability techniques despite these changes north korea remains a command economy where the state owns almost all means of production and development priorities are defined by the governmentnorth korea has the structural profile of a relatively industrialized country where nearly half of the gross domestic product is generated by industry and human development is at medium levels purchasing power parity ppp gdp is estimated at 40 billion with a very low per capita value of 1,800 in 2012 gross national income per capita was 1,523 compared to 28,430 in south korea the north korean won is the national currency issued by the central bank of the democratic peoples republic of koreathe economy is heavily nationalized food and housing are extensively subsidized by the state education and healthcare are free and the payment of taxes was officially abolished in 1974 a variety of goods are available in department stores and supermarkets in pyongyang though most of the population relies on small-scale jangmadang markets in 2009 the government attempted to stem the expanding free market by banning jangmadang and the use of foreign currency heavily devaluing the won and restricting the convertibility of savings in the old currency but the resulting inflation spike and rare public protests caused a reversal of these policies private trade is dominated by women because most men are required to be present at their workplace even though many state-owned enterprises are non-operational

industry and services employ 65% of north koreas 12.6 million labor force major industries include machine building military equipment chemicals mining metallurgy textiles food processing and tourism iron ore and coal production are among the few sectors where north korea performs significantly better than its southern neighbor – it produces about 10 times larger amounts of each resource using ex-romanian drilling rigs several oil exploration companies have confirmed significant oil reserves in the north korean shelf of the sea of japan and in areas south of pyongyang the agricultural sector was shattered by the natural disasters of the 1990s its 3,500 cooperatives and state farms were among the most productive and successful in the world around 1980 but now experience chronic fertilizer and equipment shortages rice corn soybeans and potatoes are some of the primary crops a significant contribution to the food supply comes from commercial fishing and aquaculture tourism has been a growing sector for the past decade north korea aims to increase the number of foreign visitors from 200,000 to one million by 2016 through projects like the masikryong ski resortforeign trade surpassed pre-crisis levels in 2005 and continues to expand north korea has a number of special economic zones sezs and special administrative regions where foreign companies can operate with tax and tariff incentives while north korean establishments gain access to improved technology initially four such zones existed but they yielded little overall success the sez system was overhauled in 2013 when 14 new zones were opened and the rason special economic zone was reformed as a joint chinese-north korean project the kaesong industrial region is a special economic zone where more than 100 south korean companies employ some 52,000 north korean workers as of  august 2017 china is the biggest trading partner of north korea outside inter-korean trade accounting for more than 84% of the total external trade 5.3 billion followed by india at 3.3% share 205 million in 2014 russia wrote off 90% of north koreas debt and the two countries agreed to conduct all transactions in rubles overall external trade in 2013 reached a total of 7.3 billion the highest amount since 1990 while inter-korean trade dropped to an eight-year low of 1.1 billion


 infrastructure 

north koreas energy infrastructure is obsolete and in disrepair power shortages are chronic and would not be alleviated even by electricity imports because the poorly maintained grid causes significant losses during transmission coal accounts for 70% of primary energy production followed by hydroelectric power with 17 the government under kim jong-un has increased emphasis on renewable energy projects like wind farms solar parks solar heating and biomass a set of legal regulations adopted in 2014 stressed the development of geothermal wind and solar energy along with recycling and environmental conservation north koreas long-term objective is to curb fossil fuel usage and reach an output of 5 million kilowatts from renewable sources by 2044 up from its current total of 430,000 kilowatts from all sources wind power is projected to satisfy 15% of the countrys total energy demand under this strategynorth korea also strives to develop its own civilian nuclear program these efforts are under much international dispute due to their military applications and concerns about safety

transport infrastructure includes railways highways water and air routes but rail transport is by far the most widespread north korea has some 5,200 kilometres of railways mostly in standard gauge which carry 80% of annual passenger traffic and 86% of freight but electricity shortages undermine their efficiency construction of a high-speed railway connecting kaesong pyongyang and sinuiju with speeds exceeding 200 kmh was approved in 2013 north korea connects with the trans-siberian railway through rajinroad transport is very limited — only 724 kilometers of the 25,554 kilometer road network are paved and maintenance on most roads is poor only 2% of the freight capacity is supported by river and sea transport and air traffic is negligible all port facilities are ice-free and host a merchant fleet of 158 vessels eighty-two airports and 23 helipads are operational and the largest serve the state-run airline air koryo cars are relatively rare but bicycles are common


 science and technology 

rd efforts are concentrated at the state academy of sciences which runs 40 research institutes 200 smaller research centers a scientific equipment factory and six publishing houses the government considers science and technology to be directly linked to economic development a five-year scientific plan emphasizing it biotechnology nanotechnology marine and plasma research was carried out in the early 2000s a 2010 report by the south korean science and technology policy institute identified polymer chemistry single carbon materials nanoscience mathematics software nuclear technology and rocketry as potential areas of inter-korean scientific cooperation north korean institutes are strong in these fields of research although their engineers require additional training and laboratories need equipment upgrades

under its constructing a powerful knowledge economy slogan the state has launched a project to concentrate education scientific research and production into a number of high-tech development zones international sanctions remain a significant obstacle to their development the miraewon network of electronic libraries was established in 2014 under similar sloganssignificant resources have been allocated to the national space program which is managed by the national aerospace development administration formerly managed by the korean committee of space technology until april 2013 domestically produced launch vehicles and the kwangmyŏngsŏng satellite class are launched from two spaceports the tonghae satellite launching ground and the sohae satellite launching station after four failed attempts north korea became the tenth spacefaring nation with the launch of kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 unit 2 in december 2012 which successfully reached orbit but was believed to be crippled and non-operational it joined the outer space treaty in 2009 and has stated its intentions to undertake manned and moon missions the government insists the space program is for peaceful purposes but the united states japan south korea and other countries maintain that it serves to advance military ballistic missile programson 7 february 2016 north korea successfully launched a long-range rocket supposedly to place a satellite into orbit critics believe that the real purpose of the launch was to test a ballistic missile the launch was strongly condemned by the un security council a statement broadcast on korean central television said that a new earth observation satellite kwangmyongsong-4 had successfully been put into orbit less than 10 minutes after lift-off from the sohae space centre in north phyongan provinceusage of communication technology is controlled by the ministry of post and telecommunications an adequate nationwide fiber-optic telephone system with 1.18 million fixed lines and expanding mobile coverage is in place most phones are installed for senior government officials and installation requires written explanation why the user needs a telephone and how it will be paid for cellular coverage is available with a 3g network operated by koryolink a joint venture with orascom telecom holding the number of subscribers has increased from 3,000 in 2002 to almost two million in 2013 international calls through either fixed or cellular service are restricted and mobile internet is not availableinternet access itself is limited to a handful of elite users and scientists instead north korea has a walled garden intranet system called kwangmyong which is maintained and monitored by the korea computer center its content is limited to state media chat services message boards an e-mail service and an estimated 1,000–5,500 websites computers employ the red star os an operating system derived from linux with a user shell visually similar to that of os x on 19 september 2016 a tldr project noticed the north korean internet dns data and top-level domain was left open which allowed global dns zone transfers a dump of the data discovered was shared on github


 culture 

despite a historically strong chinese influence korean culture has shaped its own unique identity it came under attack during the japanese rule from 1910 to 1945 when japan enforced a cultural assimilation policy koreans were forced to learn and speak japanese adopt the japanese family name system and shinto religion and were forbidden to write or speak the korean language in schools businesses or public placesafter the peninsula was divided in 1945 two distinct cultures formed out of the common korean heritage north koreans have little exposure to foreign influence the revolutionary struggle and the brilliance of the leadership are some of the main themes in art reactionary elements from traditional culture have been discarded and cultural forms with a folk spirit have been reintroducedkorean heritage is protected and maintained by the state over 190 historical sites and objects of national significance are cataloged as national treasures of north korea while some 1,800 less valuable artifacts are included in a list of cultural assets the historic sites and monuments in kaesong and the complex of goguryeo tombs are unesco world heritage sites


 art 

visual arts are generally produced in the aesthetics of socialist realism north korean painting combines the influence of soviet and japanese visual expression to instill a sentimental loyalty to the system all artists in north korea are required to join the artists union and the best among them can receive an official licence to portray the leaders portraits and sculptures depicting kim il-sung kim jong-il and kim jong-un are classed as number one worksmost aspects of art have been dominated by mansudae art studio since its establishment in 1959 it employs around 1,000 artists in what is likely the biggest art factory in the world where paintings murals posters and monuments are designed and produced the studio has commercialized its activity and sells its works to collectors in a variety of countries including china where it is in high demand mansudae overseas projects is a subdivision of mansudae art studio that carries out construction of large-scale monuments for international customers some of the projects include the african renaissance monument in senegal and the heroes acre in namibia


 world heritage 
in the democratic peoples republic of korea the goguryeo tumulus is registered on the world heritage list of unesco these remains were registered as the first world heritage property of north korea in the unesco world heritage committee whc in july 2004 there are 63 burial mounds in the tomb group with clear murals preserved it is believed that these murals also influenced the japanese kita tora burial mound


 music 

the government emphasized optimistic folk-based tunes and revolutionary music throughout most of the 20th century ideological messages are conveyed through massive orchestral pieces like the five great revolutionary operas based on traditional korean changguk revolutionary operas differ from their western counterparts by adding traditional instruments to the orchestra and avoiding recitative segments sea of blood is the most widely performed of the five great operas since its premiere in 1971 it has been played over 1,500 times and its 2010 tour in china was a major success western classical music by brahms tchaikovsky stravinsky and other composers is performed both by the state symphony orchestra and student orchestraspop music appeared in the 1980s with the pochonbo electronic ensemble and wangjaesan light music band improved relations with south korea following the inter-korean summit caused a decline in direct ideological messages in pop songs but themes like comradeship nostalgia and the construction of a powerful country remained in 2014 the all-girl moranbong band was described as the most popular group in the country north koreans also listen to k-pop which spreads through illegal markets


 literature 

all publishing houses are owned by the government or the wpk because they are considered an important tool for propaganda and agitation the workers party of korea publishing house is the most authoritative among them and publishes all works of kim il-sung ideological education materials and party policy documents the availability of foreign literature is limited examples being north korean editions of indian german chinese and russian fairy tales tales from shakespeare and some works of bertolt brecht and erich kästnerkim il-sungs personal works are considered classical masterpieces while the ones created under his instruction are labeled models of juche literature these include the fate of a self-defense corps man the song of korea and immortal history a series of historical novels depicting the suffering of koreans under japanese occupation more than four million literary works were published between the 1980s and the early 2000s but almost all of them belong to a narrow variety of political genres like army-first revolutionary literaturescience fiction is considered a secondary genre because it somewhat departs from the traditional standards of detailed descriptions and metaphors of the leader the exotic settings of the stories give authors more freedom to depict cyberwarfare violence sexual abuse and crime which are absent in other genres sci-fi works glorify technology and promote the juche concept of anthropocentric existence through depictions of robotics space exploration and immortality


 media 

government policies towards film are no different than those applied to other arts—motion pictures serve to fulfill the targets of social education some of the most influential films are based on historic events an jung-geun shoots itō hirobumi or folk tales hong gildong most movies have predictable propaganda story lines which make cinema an unpopular entertainment viewers only see films that feature their favorite actors western productions are only available at private showings to high-ranking party members although the 1997 film titanic is frequently shown to university students as an example of western culture access to foreign media products is available through smuggled dvds and television or radio broadcasts in border areas western films like the interview titanic and charlies angels are just a few films that have been smuggled across the borders of north korea allowing for access to the north korean citizensnorth korean media are under some of the strictest government control in the world freedom of the press in 2017 was 180th out of 180 countries in reporters without borders annual press freedom index according to freedom house all media outlets serve as government mouthpieces all journalists are party members and listening to foreign broadcasts carries the threat of a death penalty the main news provider is the korean central news agency all 12 major newspapers and 20 periodicals including rodong sinmun are published in the capitalthere are three state-owned tv stations two of them broadcast only on weekends and the korean central television is on air every day in the evenings uriminzokkiri and its associated youtube and twitter accounts distribute imagery news and video issued by government media the associated press opened the first western all-format full-time bureau in pyongyang in 2012bias in reporting on north korea has occurred in international media as a result of the countrys isolation stories like kim jong-un undergoing surgery to look like his grandfather executing his ex-girlfriend or feeding his uncle to a pack of hungry dogs have been circulated by foreign media as truth despite the lack of a credible source many of the claims originate from the south korean right-wing newspaper the chosun ilbo max fisher of the washington post has written that almost any story on north korea is treated as broadly credible no matter how outlandish or thinly sourced occasional deliberate disinformation on the part of north korean establishments further complicates the issue  the censorship in north korea encompasses all the information produced by the media monitored heavily by government officials the media is strictly used to reinforce ideals approved by the government there is no freedom of press in north korea as all the media is controlled and filtered through governmental censors


 cuisine
