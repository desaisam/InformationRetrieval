 history 


 prehistory 

the earliest attested archaeological artifacts in iran like those excavated at kashafrud and ganj par in northern iran confirm a human presence in iran since the lower paleolithic irans neanderthal artifacts from the middle paleolithic have been found mainly in the zagros region at sites such as warwasi and yafteh from the 10th to the seventh millennium bc early agricultural communities began to flourish in and around the zagros region in western iran including chogha golan chogha bonut and chogha mishthe emergence of susa as a city as determined by radiocarbon dating dates back to early 4,395 bc there are dozens of prehistoric sites across the iranian plateau pointing to the existence of ancient cultures and urban settlements in the fourth millennium bc during the bronze age the territory of present-day iran was home to several civilizations including elam jiroft and zayanderud elam the most prominent of these civilizations developed in the southwest alongside those in mesopotamia and continued its existence until the emergence of the iranian empires the advent of writing in elam was paralleled to sumer and the elamite cuneiform was developed since the third millennium bcfrom the 34th to the 20th century bc northwestern iran was part of the kura-araxes culture which stretched into the neighboring caucasus and anatolia since the earliest second millennium bc assyrians settled in swaths of western iran and incorporated the region into their territories


 classical antiquity 

by the second millennium bc the ancient iranian peoples arrived in what is now iran from the eurasian steppe rivaling the native settlers of the region as the iranians dispersed into the wider area of greater iran and beyond the boundaries of modern-day iran were dominated by median persian and parthian tribes
from the late 10th to the late seventh century bc the iranian peoples together with the pre-iranian kingdoms fell under the domination of the assyrian empire based in northern mesopotamia under king cyaxares the medes and persians entered into an alliance with babylonian ruler nabopolassar as well as the fellow iranian scythians and cimmerians and together they attacked the assyrian empire the civil war ravaged the assyrian empire between 616 and 605 bc thus freeing their respective peoples from three centuries of assyrian rule the unification of the median tribes under king deioces in 728 bc led to the foundation of the median empire which by 612 bc controlled almost the entire territory of present-day iran and eastern anatolia this marked the end of the kingdom of urartu as well which was subsequently conquered and dissolved

in 550 bc cyrus the great the son of mandane and cambyses i took over the median empire and founded the achaemenid empire by unifying other city-states the conquest of media was a result of what is called the persian revolt the brouhaha was initially triggered by the actions of the median ruler astyages and was quickly spread to other provinces as they allied with the persians later conquests under cyrus and his successors expanded the empire to include lydia babylon egypt parts of the balkans and eastern europe proper as well as the lands to the west of the indus and oxus rivers
539 bc was the year in which persian forces defeated the babylonian army at opis and marked the end of around four centuries of mesopotamian domination of the region by conquering the neo-babylonian empire cyrus entered babylon and presented himself as a traditional mesopotamian monarch subsequent achaemenid art and iconography reflect the influence of the new political reality in mesopotamia

at its greatest extent the achaemenid empire included territories of modern-day iran republic of azerbaijan arran and shirvan armenia georgia turkey anatolia much of the black sea coastal regions northeastern greece and southern bulgaria thrace northern greece and the republic of macedonia paeonia and macedon iraq syria lebanon jordan israel and the palestinian territories all significant population centers of ancient egypt as far west as libya kuwait northern saudi arabia parts of the united arab emirates and oman pakistan afghanistan and much of central asia making it the first world government and the largest empire the world had yet seenit is estimated that in 480 bc 50 million people lived in the achaemenid empire the empire at its peak ruled over 44% of the worlds population the highest such figure for any empire in history

the achaemenid empire is noted for the release of the jewish exiles in babylon building infrastructures such as the royal road and the chapar postal service and the use of an official language imperial aramaic throughout its territories the empire had a centralized bureaucratic administration under the emperor a large professional army and civil services inspiring similar developments in later empireseventual conflict on the western borders began with the ionian revolt which erupted into the greco-persian wars and continued through the first half of the fifth century bc and ended with the withdrawal of the achaemenids from all of the territories in the balkans and eastern europe properin 334 bc alexander the great invaded the achaemenid empire defeating the last achaemenid emperor darius iii at the battle of issus following the premature death of alexander iran came under the control of the hellenistic seleucid empire in the middle of the second century bc the parthian empire rose to become the main power in iran and the century-long geopolitical arch-rivalry between the romans and the parthians began culminating in the roman–parthian wars the parthian empire continued as a feudal monarchy for nearly five centuries until 224 ce when it was succeeded by the sasanian empire together with their neighboring arch-rival the roman-byzantines they made up the worlds two most dominant powers at the time for over four centuries

the sasanians established an empire within the frontiers achieved by the achaemenids with their capital at ctesiphon late antiquity is considered one of irans most influential periods as under the sasanians their influence reached the culture of ancient rome and through that as far as western europe africa china and india and played a prominent role in the formation of the medieval art of both europe and asia

most of the era of the sasanian empire was overshadowed by the roman–persian wars which raged on the western borders at anatolia the western caucasus mesopotamia and the levant for over 700 years these wars exhausted both the romans and the sasanians and led to the defeat of both by the muslim invasion
throughout the achaemenid parthian and sasanian eras several offshoots of the iranian dynasties established eponymous branches in anatolia and the caucasus including the pontic kingdom the mihranids and the arsacid dynasties of armenia iberia georgia and caucasian albania present-day republic of azerbaijan and southern dagestan


 medieval period 

the prolonged byzantine–sasanian wars most importantly the climactic war of 602–628 as well as the social conflict within the sasanian empire opened the way for an arab invasion of iran in the seventh century the empire was initially defeated by the rashidun caliphate which was succeeded by the umayyad caliphate followed by the abbasid caliphate meanwhile the prolonged and gradual process of islamization was followed which targeted irans then zoroastrian majority and included religious persecution demolition of libraries and fire temples a special tax penalty jizya and language shiftin 750 the abbasids overthrew the umayyads notably by the support from the mawali converted iranians the mawali formed the majority of the rebel army which was led by converted iranian general abu muslim the arrival of the abbasid caliphs saw a relative revival of iranian culture and influence as the role of the old arab aristocracy was partially replaced by a muslim iranian bureaucracyafter two centuries of arab rule semi-independent and independent iranian kingdoms—including the tahirids saffarids samanids and buyids—began to appear on the fringes of the declining abbasid caliphate by the samanid era in the ninth and 10th centuries the efforts of iranians to regain their independence had been well solidified

the blossoming literature philosophy mathematics medicine astronomy and art of iran became major elements in the formation of a new age for the iranian civilization during a period known as the islamic golden age the islamic golden age reached its peak by the 10th and 11th centuries during which iran was the main theater of scientific activities after the 10th century persian alongside arabic was used for scientific medical philosophical arithmetical historical and musical works and renowned iranian writers—such as tusi avicenna qotb-od-din shirazi and biruni—had major contributions in scientific writing among irans famous medieval scientists al-khwarizmi whose name was latinized as algoritmi gave a significant role in the development of the arabic numerals and algebra through his 9th-century work on the calculation with hindu numerals that is globally adopted as the modern numerical system
the cultural revival that began in the abbasid period led to a resurfacing of the iranian national identity thus the attempts of arabization never succeeded in iran the shuubiyya movement became a catalyst for iranians to regain independence in their relations with the arab invaders the most notable effect of this movement was the continuation of the persian language attested to the works of the epic poet ferdowsi now considered the most prominent figure in iranian literature

the 10th century saw a mass migration of turkic tribes from central asia into the iranian plateau turkic tribesmen were first used in the abbasid army as mamluks slave-warriors replacing iranian and arab elements within the army as a result the mamluks gained a significant political power in 999 large portions of iran came briefly under the rule of the ghaznavids whose rulers were of mamluk turkic origin and longer subsequently under the seljuk and khwarezmian empires these dynasties had been persianized and had adopted persian models of administration and rulership the seljuks subsequently gave rise to the sultanate of rum in anatolia while taking their thoroughly persianized identity with them the result of the adoption and patronage of iranian culture by turkish rulers was the development of a distinct turko-persian tradition
from 1219 to 1221 under the khwarezmian empire iran suffered a devastating invasion by the mongol army of genghis khan according to steven r ward mongol violence and depredations killed up to three-fourths of the population of the iranian plateau possibly 10 to 15 million people some historians have estimated that irans population did not again reach its pre-mongol levels until the mid-20th centuryfollowing the fracture of the mongol empire in 1256 hulagu khan grandson of genghis khan established the ilkhanate in iran in 1370 yet another conqueror timur followed the example of hulagu establishing the timurid empire which lasted for another 156 years in 1387 timur ordered the complete massacre of isfahan reportedly killing 70,000 citizens the ilkhans and the timurids soon came to adopt the ways and customs of the iranians surrounding themselves with a culture that was distinctively iranian


 early modern period 

by the 1500s ismail i of ardabil established the safavid empire with his capital at tabriz beginning with azerbaijan he subsequently extended his authority over all of the iranian territories and established an intermittent iranian hegemony over the vast relative regions reasserting the iranian identity within large parts of greater iran iran was predominantly sunni but ismail instigated a forced conversion to the shia branch of islam spreading throughout the safavid territories in the caucasus iran anatolia and mesopotamia as a result thereof modern-day iran is the only official shia nation of the world with it holding an absolute majority in iran and the republic of azerbaijan having there the first and the second highest number of shia inhabitants by population percentage in the world meanwhile the centuries-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between safavid iran and the neighboring ottoman empire led to numerous ottoman–iranian wars

the safavid era peaked in the reign of abbas i 1587–1629 surpassing their turkish archrivals in strength and making iran a leading science and art hub in western eurasia the safavid era saw the start of mass integration from caucasian populations into new layers of the society of iran as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of iran playing a pivotal role in the history of iran for centuries onwards following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and the early 1700s which was caused by internal conflicts the continuous wars with the ottomans and the foreign interference most notably the russian interference the safavid rule was ended by the pashtun rebels who besieged isfahan and defeated sultan husayn in 1722
in 1729 nader shah a chieftain and military genius from khorasan successfully drove out and conquered the pashtun invaders he subsequently took back the annexed caucasian territories which were divided among the ottoman and russian authorities by the ongoing chaos in iran during the reign of nader shah iran reached its greatest extent since the sasanian empire reestablishing the iranian hegemony all over the caucasus as well as other major parts of the west and central asia and briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time

nader shah invaded india and sacked far off delhi by the late 1730s his territorial expansion as well as his military successes went into a decline following the final campaigns in the northern caucasus against then revolting lezgins the assassination of nader shah sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil after which karim khan of the zand dynasty came to power in 1750 bringing a period of relative peace and prosperitycompared to its preceding dynasties the geopolitical reach of the zand dynasty was limited many of the iranian territories in the caucasus gained de facto autonomy and were locally ruled through various caucasian khanates however despite the self-ruling they all remained subjects and vassals to the zand king another civil war ensued after the death of karim khan in 1779 out of which agha mohammad khan emerged founding the qajar dynasty in 1794 in 1795 following the disobedience of the georgian subjects and their alliance with the russians the qajars captured tbilisi by the battle of krtsanisi and drove the russians out of the entire caucasus reestablishing the iranian suzerainty over the region


 from the 1800s to the 1940s 

the russo-iranian wars of 1804–1813 and 1826–1828 resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for iran in the caucasus comprising all of transcaucasia and dagestan which made part of the very concept of iran for centuries and thus substantial gains for the neighboring russian empire
as a result of the 19th-century russo-iranian wars the russians took over the caucasus and iran irrevocably lost control over its integral territories in the region comprising modern-day dagestan georgia armenia and republic of azerbaijan which got confirmed per the treaties of gulistan and turkmenchay the area to the north of aras river among which the contemporary republic of azerbaijan eastern georgia dagestan and armenia are located were iranian territory until they were occupied by russia in the course of the 19th centuryas iran shrank many transcaucasian and north caucasian muslims moved towards iran especially until the aftermath of the circassian genocide and the decades afterwards while irans armenians were encouraged to settle in the newly incorporated russian territories causing significant demographic shifts
around 1.5 million people—20 to 25% of the population of iran—died as a result of the great famine of 1870–1871

between 1872 and 1905 a series of protests took place in response to the sale of concessions to foreigners by qajar monarchs naser-ed-din and mozaffar-ed-din and led to the constitutional revolution in 1905 the first iranian constitution and the first national parliament of iran were founded in 1906 through the ongoing revolution the constitution included the official recognition of irans three religious minorities namely christians jews and zoroastrians which has remained a basis in the legislation of iran since then the struggle related to the constitutional movement was followed by the triumph of tehran in 1909 when mohammad ali shah was defeated and forced to abdicate on the pretext of restoring order the russians occupied northern iran in 1911 and maintained a military presence in the region for years to come but this did not put an end to the civil uprisings and was soon followed by mirza kuchik khans jungle movement against both the qajar monarchy and foreign invaders

during world war i the british occupied much of the territory of western iran and fully withdrew in 1921 meanwhile a famine in northern iran killed between eight and 10 million people the persian campaign commenced furthermore in northwestern iran after an ottoman invasion as part of the middle eastern theatre of world war i in the course of the assyrian genocide of 1914–1920 and the armenian genocide of 1915–1917 a large number of iranian assyrians and armenians were subjected to mass murders committed by the ottoman troops that were crossing the northwestern border notably in and around khoy maku salmas and urmiaapart from the rule of agha mohammad khan the qajar rule is characterized as a century of misrule the iranian cossack brigade which was the most effective military force available to the crown began a military coup supported by the british in february 1921 the qajar dynasty was subsequently overthrown and reza khan the former general of the cossack brigade became the new prime minister of iran eventually he was declared the new monarch in 1925—thence known as reza shah—establishing the pahlavi dynasty
in the midst of world war ii in 1941 nazi germany began the so-called operation barbarossa and invaded the soviet union breaking the molotov–ribbentrop pact this had a major impact on iran which had declared neutrality in the conflicts later that year following an anglo-soviet invasion of iran reza shah was forced to abdicate in favor of his son mohammad reza pahlavi subsequently iran became a major conduit for british and american aid to the soviet union until the end of the ongoing war

at the 1943 tehran conference the allied big three—joseph stalin franklin d roosevelt and winston churchill—issued the tehran declaration to guarantee the post-war independence and boundaries of iran however at the end of the war soviet troops remained in iran and local pro-soviet groups established two puppet states in north-western iran namely the peoples government of azerbaijan and the republic of mahabad receiving a promise of oil concessions the soviets withdrew from iran proper in may 1946 the two puppet states were soon overthrown following the iran crisis of 1946 and the oil concessions were revoked


 contemporary era 

in 1951 mohammad mosaddegh was appointed as the prime minister he became enormously popular in iran after he nationalized irans petroleum industry and oil reserves he was deposed in the 1953 iranian coup détat an anglo-american covert operation that marked the first time the united states had overthrown a foreign government during the cold war

after the coup the shah became increasingly autocratic and sultanistic and iran entered a phase of decades-long controversial close relations with the united states and some other foreign governments while the shah increasingly modernized iran and claimed to retain it as a fully secular state arbitrary arrests and torture by his secret police the savak were used to crush all forms of political oppositionruhollah khomeini a radical muslim cleric became an active critic of the shahs far-reaching series of reforms known as the white revolution khomeini publicly denounced the government and was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months after his release in 1964 he refused to apologize and was eventually sent into exile
due to the 1973 spike in oil prices the economy of iran was flooded with foreign currency which caused inflation by 1974 the economy of iran was experiencing double digit inflation and despite the many large projects to modernize the country corruption was rampant and caused large amounts of waste by 1975 and 1976 an economic recession led to increased unemployment especially among millions of youth who had migrated to the cities of iran looking for construction jobs during the boom years of the early 1970s by the late 1970s many of these people opposed the shahs regime and began to organize and join the protests against it

the 1979 revolution later known as the islamic revolution began in january 1978 with the first major demonstrations against the shah after a year of strikes and demonstrations paralyzing the country and its economy mohammad reza pahlavi fled the country and ruhollah khomeini returned from exile to tehran in february 1979 forming a new government after holding a referendum iran officially became an islamic republic in april 1979 a second referendum in december 1979 approved a theocratic constitutionthe immediate nationwide uprisings against the new government began with the 1979 kurdish rebellion and the khuzestan uprisings along with the uprisings in sistan and baluchestan and other areas over the next several years these uprisings were subdued in a violent manner by the new islamic government the new government began purging itself of the non-islamist political opposition as well as of those islamists who were not considered radical enough although both nationalists and marxists had initially joined with islamists to overthrow the shah tens of thousands were executed by the new regime afterwards many former ministers and officials in the shahs government including former prime minister amir-abbas hoveyda were brutally shot dead by firing squads on khomeinis order to purge the new government of any remaining officials still loyal to the exiled shah
on 4 november 1979 a group of muslim students seized the united states embassy and took the embassy with 52 personnel and citizens hostage after the united states refused to return mohammad reza pahlavi to iran to face trial in the court of the new regime and all but certain execution attempts by the jimmy carter administration to negotiate for the release of the hostages and a failed rescue attempt helped force carter out of office and brought ronald reagan to power on jimmy carters final day in office the last hostages were finally set free as a result of the algiers accords
the cultural revolution began in 1980 with an initial closure of universities for three years in order to perform an inspection and clean up in the cultural policy of the education and training system

on 22 september 1980 the iraqi army invaded the western iranian province of khuzestan launching the iran–iraq war although the forces of saddam hussein made several early advances by mid 1982 the iranian forces successfully managed to drive the iraqi army back into iraq in july 1982 with iraq thrown on the defensive the regime of iran took the decision to invade iraq and conducted countless offensives in a bid to conquer iraqi territory and capture cities such as basra the war continued until 1988 when the iraqi army defeated the iranian forces inside iraq and pushed the remaining iranian troops back across the border subsequently khomeini accepted a truce mediated by the united nations the total iranian casualties in the war were estimated to be 123,220–160,000 kia 60,711 mia and 11,000–16,000 civilians killed

following the iran–iraq war in 1989 akbar hashemi rafsanjani and his administration concentrated on a pragmatic pro-business policy of rebuilding and strengthening the economy without making any dramatic break with the ideology of the revolution in 1997 rafsanjani was succeeded by moderate reformist mohammad khatami whose government attempted unsuccessfully to make the country more free and democraticthe 2005 presidential election brought conservative populist candidate mahmoud ahmadinejad to power by the time of the 2009 iranian presidential election the interior ministry announced incumbent president ahmadinejad had won 62.63% of the vote while mir-hossein mousavi had come in second place with 33.75 the election results were widely disputed and resulted in widespread protests both within iran and in major cities outside the country and the creation of the iranian green movement
hassan rouhani was elected as the president on 15 june 2013 defeating mohammad bagher ghalibaf and four other candidates the electoral victory of rouhani has relatively improved the relations of iran with other countries
