space launch market competition is the manifestation of market forces in the launch service provider business in particular it is the trend of competitive dynamics among payload transport capabilities at diverse prices having a greater influence on launch purchasing than the traditional political considerations of country of manufacture or the national entity using regulating or licensing the launch service
following the advent of spaceflight technology in the late 1950s space launch services came into being exclusively by national programs later in the 20th century commercial operators became significant customers of launch providers international competition for the communications satellite payload subset of the launch market was increasingly influenced by commercial considerations however even during this period for both commercial- and government-entity-launched commsats the launch service providers for these payloads used launch vehicles built to government specifications and with state-provided development funding exclusively
in the early 2010s privately developed launch vehicle systems and space launch service offerings emerged companies now faced economic incentives rather than the principally political incentives of the earlier decades the space launch business experienced a dramatic lowering of per-unit prices along with the addition of entirely new capabilities bringing about a new phase of competition in the space launch market


 history 
in the early decades of the space age—1950s–2000s—the government space agencies of the soviet union and the united states pioneered space technology this was augmented by collaboration with affiliated design bureaus in the ussr and contracts with commercial companies in the us all rocket designs were built explicitly for government purposes the european space agency esa was formed in 1975 largely following the same model of space technology development other national space agencies—such as chinas cnsa
and indias isro—also financed the indigenous development of their own national designs
communications satellites were the principal non-government market although launch competition in the early years after 2010 occurred only in and amongst global commercial launch providers the us market for military launches began to experience multi-provider competition in 2015 as the us government began to move away from their previous monopoly arrangement with united launch alliance ula for military launches by 2018 the ula monopoly on us national security space launch had evaporatedby mid-2017 the results of this multi-year competitive pressure on commercially bid launch prices was being observed in the actual number of launches achieved with frequent recovery of first-stage boosters by spacex expendable missions had become a rare occurrence for them  but the new landscape did not come without a cost  many space launch providers are expending capital to develop new lower-cost reusable spaceflight technologies  spacex alone had expended about us1 billion by 2017 in order to develop the capability to reuse orbital class boosters on a subsequent flight


 1970s and 1980s commercial satellites emerge 
non-military commercial satellites began to be launched in volume in the 1970s and 1980s launch services were supplied exclusively with launch vehicles developed originally for various cold war military programs with their attendant cost structuresspacenews journalist peter b de selding has asserted that french government leadership and the arianespace consortium all but invented the commercial launch business in the 1980s principally by ignoring us government assurances that the reusable us space shuttle would make expendable launch vehicles like ariane obsoletelittle market competition emerged inside any national market before approximately the late 2000s some global commercial competition arose between the national providers of various nation states for international commercial satellite launches within the us as late as 2006 the high cost structures built in to government contractors—boeings delta iv and lockheed martins atlas v—launch vehicles left little commercial opportunity for us launch service providers but considerable opportunity for low-cost russian boosters based on leftover cold war military missile technologydarpas simon p worden and the usafs jess sponable analyzed the situation in 2006 and offered that one bright point is the emerging private sector which was then pursuing suborbital or small lift capabilities  they concluded although such vehicles support very limited us department of defense or national aeronautics and space administration spaceflight needs they do offer potential technology demonstration stepping stones to more capable systems needed in the future demonstrating capabilities that would grow in the next five years while supporting published list prices substantially below the rates on offer by the national providers


 2010s competition and pricing pressure 

since the early 2010s new private options for obtaining spaceflight services emerged bringing substantial price pressure into the existing marketbefore 2013  europes arianespace which flies the ariane 5 and international launch services ils which marketed russias proton vehicle dominated the communications satellite launch market in november 2013 arianespace announced new pricing flexibility for the lighter satellites it carries to orbits aboard its ariane 5 in response to spacexs growing presence in the worldwide launch marketin early december 2013 spacex flew its first launch to a geosynchronous orbit providing additional credibility to its low prices which had been published since at least 2009 the low launch prices offered by the company especially for communication satellites flying to geostationary gto orbit resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their pricesby late 2013 with a published price of us56.5 million per launch to low earth orbit falcon 9 rockets were already the cheapest in the industry reusable falcon 9s could drop the price by an order of magnitude sparking more space-based enterprise which in turn would drop the cost of access to space still further through economies of scalefalcon 9 gto missions 2014 pricing was approximately us15 million less than a launch on a chinese long march 3b
despite spacex prices being somewhat lower than long march prices the chinese government and the great wall industry company—which markets the long march for commsat missions—made a policy decision to maintain commsat launch prices at approximately us70 million
in early 2014 the esa asked european governments for additional subsidies to face the competition from spacexcontinuing to face stiff competition on price in april seven european satellite operator companies—including the four largest in the world by annual revenue—asked that the esa find immediate ways to reduce ariane 5 rocket launch costs and in the longer term make the next-generation ariane 6 vehicle more attractive for smaller telecommunications satellites  considerable efforts to restore competitiveness in price of the existing european launcher need to be undertaken if europe is to maintain its market situation  in the short term a more favorable pricing policy for the small satellites currently being targeted by spacex seems indispensable to keeping the ariane launch manifest strong and well-populated
in competitive bids during 2013 and early 2014 spacex was winning many launch customers that formerly would have been all-but-certain clients of europes arianespace launch consortium with prices that are 60 million or less facing direct market competition from spacex the large us launch provider united launch alliance ula announced strategic changes in 2014 to restructure its launch business—replacing two launch vehicle families atlas v and delta iv with the new vulcan architecture—while implementing an iterative and incremental development program to build a partially reusable and much lower-cost launch system over the next decadein june 2014 arianespace ceo stephane israel announced that european efforts to remain competitive in response to spacexs recent success had begun in earnest this included the creation of a new joint venture company from arianespaces two largest shareholders the launch-vehicle producer airbus and engine-producer safran no additional details of the efforts to become more competitive were released at the timein august 2014 eutelsat the third-largest fixed satellite services operator worldwide by revenue indicated that it planned to spend approximately €100 million less each year in the next three years due to lower prices for launch services and by transitioning their commsats to electric propulsion they indicated they are using the lower prices they can get from spacex against arianespace in negotiations for launch contractsby december 2014 arianespace had selected a design and commenced development of the ariane 6 its new entrant into the commercial launch market aiming for more competitively priced launch service offerings with operational flights planned to begin in 2020in october 2014 ula announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease launch costs by half one of the reasons given for the restructuring and new cost reduction goals was competition from spacex ula had less success landing contracts to launch private commercial communications and earth observation satellites than it had with launch us military payloads but ceo tory bruno believed the new lower-cost launcher could be competitive and succeed in the commercial satellite sector the us gao calculated the average cost of each ula rocket launch for the us government had risen to approximately us420 million in 2014by november 2014 spacex had already begun to take market share from arianespace eutelsat ceo michel de rosen said in reference to esas program to develop the ariane 6 each year that passes will see spacex advance gain market share and further reduce its costs through economies of scale
european government research ministers approved the development of the new european rocket—ariane 6—in december 2014 projecting the rocket would be cheaper to construct and to operate and that more modern methods of production and a streamlined assembly to try to reduce unit costs plus the rockets modular design can be tailored to a wide range of satellite and mission types so it should gain further economies from frequent usein 2015 the esa was endeavoring to reorganize to reduce bureaucracy and decrease inefficiencies in launcher and satellite spending which had been tied historically to the amount of tax funds that each country has provided to itin may 2015 ula stated it would go out of business unless it won commercial and civil satellite launch orders to offset an expected slump in us military and spy launches as of  2015 spacex had remained the low-cost supplier in the industry however in the market for launches of us military payloads ula faced no competition for nearly a decade since the formation of the ula joint venture from lockheed martin and boeing in 2006 however spacex was also upsetting the traditional military space launch arrangement in the us which was called a monopoly by space analyst marco caceres and criticized by some in the us congress as of may 2015 the spacex falcon 9 v1.1 was certified by the usaf to compete to launch many of the expensive satellites which are considered essential to us national securityuniversity of southampton researcher clemens rumpf argued in 2015 that the global launch industry was developed in an old world where space funding was provided by governments resulting in a stable foundation for global space activities the money for the space industry had been secure and did not encourage risk-taking in the development of new space technologies  the space landscape had not changed much since the mid-1980s  as a result the emergence of spacex was a surprise to other launch providers because the need to evolve launcher technology by a giant leap was not apparent to them spacex showed that technology has advanced sufficiently in the last 30 years to enable new game changing approaches to space access the washington post said that the changes occasioned from multiple competing service providers resulted in a revolution in innovationby mid-2015 arianespace was speaking publicly about job reductions as part of an attempt to remain competitive in the european industry which is being restructured consolidated rationalised and streamlined to respond to spacex price competition still arianespace remained confident it could maintain its 50 per cent share of the space launch market despite spacexs slashing prices by building reliable rockets that are smaller and cheaperfollowing the first successful landing and recovery of a spacex falcon 9 first stage in december 2015 equity analysts at investment bank jefferies estimated that launch costs to satellite operators using falcon 9 launch vehicles may decline by about 40 percent of spacex typical us61 million per launch
although spacex had only forecast an approximately 30 percent launch price reduction from the use of a reused first stage by early 2016 in early 2016 arianespace was projecting a launch price of €90–100 million about one-half of the 2015 ariane 5 per launch pricein march 2017 spacex reused an orbital booster stage that had been previously launched landed and recovered stating the cost to the company of doing so was substantially less than half the cost of a new first stage coo gwynne shotwell said the cost savings came even though spacex did extensive work to examine and refurbish the stage we did way more on this one than is planned for future recovered stages
a 2017 industry-wide view by spacenews reported  by 5 july 2017 spacex had launched 10 payloads during a bit over six months—outperforming its cadence from earlier years—and is well on track to hit the target it set last year of 18 launches in a single year there were indeed 18 successful falcon 9 launches in 2017 by comparison france-based arianespace spacex’s chief competitor for commercial telecommunications satellite launches is launching 11 to 12 times a year using its fleet of three rockets—the heavy-lift ariane 5 medium-lift soyuz and light-lift vega russia has the ability to launch a dozen or more times with proton doing both government and commercial missions but has operated at a slower cadence the past few years due to launch failures and the discovery of an incorrect material used in some rocket engines united launch alliance spacex’s chief competitor for defense missions regularly conducts around a dozen or more launches per year but the boeing-lockheed martin joint venture has only performed four missions through mid-year 2017by 2018 the monopoly ula had held on us national security space launch was over
ula responded to the falcon 9 by beginning development in 2014 on the vulcan rocket a partly reusable vehicle powered by blue origin be-4 engines intended to replace its ageing expendable atlas v and delta iv rockets
in early 2018 spacenews reported that the rise of spacex has disrupted the launch industry at large by mid-2018 with proton flying as few as two launches in an entire year the russian state corporation roscosmos announced they would retire the proton launch vehicle in part due to competition from lower-cost launch alternativesin 2018 spacex launched a record 21 times in 2018 exceeding the 18 launches in 2017 ula had flown just 8 flights in 2018


 raising private capital 
private capital invested in the space launch industry before to 2015 was modest from 2000 through the end of 2015 a total of us13.3 billion of investment finance had been invested in the space sector us2.9 billion of that was venture capital financing of which 1.8 billion was invested in 2015 alonefor the space launch sector this began to change with the january 2015 google and fidelity investments investment of us1 billion in spacex while private satellite manufacturing companies had previously raised large capital rounds that has been the largest investment to date in a launch service providerspacex developed the falcon heavy first flight in february 2018 and are developing the bfr launch vehicle with private capital no government financing is being provided for either rocketafter decades of reliance on government funding to develop the atlas and delta families of launch vehicles in october 2014 the successor company—ula—began development of a rocket initially with  private funds as one part of a solution for its problem of skyrocketing launch costs  however by march 2016 it had become clear that the new vulcan launch vehicle would be developed with funding via a public–private partnership with the us government by early 2016 the us air force had committed us201 million of funding for vulcan development ula has not put a firm price tag on the total cost of vulcan development but ula ceo tory bruno has said new rockets typically cost 2 billion including 1 billion for the main engine ula had asked the us government in 2016 to provide a minimum of us1.2 billion by 2020 to assist it in developing the new us launch vehicle  it was unclear how the change in development funding mechanisms might change ula plans for pricing market-driven launch services
since vulcan development began in october 2014 the privately generated funding for vulcan development has been approved only on a short term basis  the ula board of directors—composed entirely of executives from boeing and lockheed martin—is approving development funding on a quarter-by-quarter basisother launch service providers are developing new space launch systems with substantial government capital investment for the new esa launch vehicle—ariane 6 aiming for flight in the 2020s—€400 million of development capital was requested to be industrys share ostensibly private capital €2.815 billion was slated to be provided by various european government sources at the time the early finance structure was made public in april 2015 in the event frances airbus safran launchers—the company building the ariane 6—did agree to provide €400 million of development funding in june 2015 with expectation of formalizing the development contract in july 2015as of  may 2015 the japanese legislature was considering legislation to provide a legal framework for private company spaceflight initiatives in japan it was unclear whether the legislation would become law and if so whether significant private capital would subsequently enter the japanese space launch industry as a resultin the event the legislation appears not to have become law and little change in the funding mechanism for japanese space vehicles are anticipated
the economics of space launch are driven in part by business demand in the space economy  morgan stanley projected in 2017 that revenue from the global industry will increase to at least us1.1 trillion by 2040 more than triple the figure in 2016 this does not include the more aspirational possibilities presented by space tourism or mining nor by nasa megaprojects


 2019 and beyond 
a number of market responses to the increase of lower-cost competition in the space launch market began in the 2010s as rocket engine and rocket technologies have fairly long development cycles most of the results of these moves will not be seen until the late-2010s and early 2020s
ula entered into a partnership with blue origin in september 2014 to develop the be-4 loxmethane engine to replace the rd-180 on a new lower-cost first stage booster rocket at the time the engine was already in its third year of development by blue origin ula indicated then they expected the new stage and engine to start flying no earlier than 2019 on a successor to the atlas v a month later ula announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease launch costs by half one of the reasons given for the restructuring and new cost reduction goals was competition from spacex ula intended to have preliminary design ideas in place for a blending of the atlas v and delta iv technology by the end of 2014 but in the event the high-level design was announced in april 2015 by early 2018 ula had  moved the first launch date for the vulcan launch vehicle to no earlier than mid-2020blue origin is also planning to begin flying its own orbital launch vehicle—the new glenn—in 2020 a rocket that will also use the blue be-4 engine on the first stage the same as the ula vulcan blue origins jeff bezos initially said they did not plan to compete for the us military launch market stating the market is a relatively small number of flights its very hard to do well and ula is already great at it im not sure where we would add any value bezos sees competition as a good thing particularly as competition leads to his ultimate goal of getting millions and millions of people living and working in space this decision was reversed in 2017 with blue origin saying it did intend to compete for us national security launchesin early 2015 the french space agency cnes began working with germany and a few other governments to start a modest research effort with a hope to propose a loxmethane reusable launch system tentatively named ariane next by mid-2015 with flight testing unlikely before approximately 2026 the stated design objective was to reduce both the cost and duration of reusable vehicle refurbishment and was partially motivated by the pressure of lower-cost competitive options with newer technological capabilities not found in the ariane 6 responding to competitive pressures one stated objective of ariane next is to reduce ariane launch cost by a factor of two beyond improvements brought by ariane 6 operational flights are scheduled to begin in 2020spacex stated in 2014 that if they were successful at developing the reusable technology launch prices in the us5 to 7 million range for the reusable falcon 9 could be achieved in the longer term in the event spacex did not choose to develop the reusable second stage for the falcon 9 but are doing so for their next-generation launch vehicle the new fully reusable bfr spacex indicated in 2017 that the single-launch marginal cost of bfr would be approximately us7 million
after the mid-2010s prices for smallsat and cubesat launch services began to decline significantly both the addition of new small launch vehicles to the market rocket lab electron firefly vector and several chinese service providers and the addition of new capacity of rideshare services are putting price pressure on existing providers cubesats that used to cost us350,000–400,000 to launch are now us250,000 and going downaccording to an industry panel interviewed in october 2018 an industry shakeout is expected between 2019 and 2021 due to the excess supply compared to demand prices should reach stability once the new entrants have demonstrated their capabilities


 competition for the american heavy-lift market 
as early as august 2014 media sources noted that the us launch market may have two competitive super-heavy launch vehicles available in the 2020s to launch payloads of 100 metric tons 220,000 lb or more to low-earth orbit the us government is developing the space launch system sls capable of lifting very large payloads of 70 to 130 tonnes 150,000 to 290,000 lb from earth on the commercial side spacex has been privately developing its next-generation bfr launch architecture formerly known as the mars colonial transporter or the interplanetary transport system featuring fully reusable boosters and spacecraft and targeting 150 tonnes 330,000 lb of payload development of the methalox raptor engine began in 2012 and the first flight tests are scheduled for 2019 by 2014 nasaspaceflightcom reported spacex had never openly portrayed its bfr plans in competition with nasa’s sls  however should spacex make solid progress on the development of its bfr over the coming years it is almost unavoidable that america’s two hlvs will attract comparisons and a healthy debate potentially at the political levelthe bfr system is planned to replace the falcon 9 and falcon heavy launch vehicles as well as the dragon spacecraft initially aiming at the earth-orbit launch market but explicitly adding substantial capability to support long-duration spaceflight in the cislunar and mars mission environments spacex intends this approach to bring significant cost savings that will help the company justify the development expense of designing and building the bfr systemfollowing the successful first launch of the spacex falcon heavy in february 2018 and with spacex advertising a us90 million list price for transporting up to 63,800 kg 140,700 lb to low-earth orbit us president donald trump said if the government did it the same thing would have cost probably 40 or 50 times that amount of money i mean literally when i heard 80 sic million im so used to hearing different numbers with nasa
space journalist eric berger reported trump seems to be siding with commercial space advocates who say that while rockets like the falcon heavy may be slightly less capable than the sls they come at a drastically reduced price that will enable much quicker broader exploration of the solar system


 launch contract competitive results 


 before 2014 
before 2014 arianespace had dominated the commercial launch market for many years in 2004 for example they held over 50% of the world market
2010 26 geostationary commercial satellites were ordered under long-term launch contracts
2011 only 17 geostationary commercial satellites went under contract during 2011 as an historically large capital spending surge by the biggest satellite fleet operators began to tail off something that had been anticipated to follow the various satellite fleets being substantially upgraded
2012 as of  september 2012 the major launch providers globally were arianespace france international launch services united states which markets the russian proton launch vehicle and sea launch of switzerland which markets the russian-ukrainian zenit rocket in late 2012 each of them had manifests that were full or nearly so for both 2012 and 2013
23 geostationary orbit communications satellites were placed under firm contract during 2013


 2014 
a total of 20 launches were booked in 2014 for commercial launch service providers 19 were for flights to geostationary orbit geo one was for a low-earth orbit leo launcharianespace and spacex each signed nine contracts for geostationary launches while mitsubishi heavy industries was awarded one united launch alliance signed one commercial contract to launch an orbital sciences corporation cygnus spacecraft to the leo-orbiting international space station following the destruction over the pad of an orbital antares vehicle in october 2014 this was the first year in some time that no commercial launches were booked on the russian proton-m and russian-ukrainian zenit launch service providersfor perspective eight additional satellites in 2014 were booked by national launch providers in deals for which no competitive bids were soughtoverall in 2014 arianespace took 60% of commercial launch market share


 2015 
in 2015 arianespace signed 14 commercial-order launch contracts for geosynchronous-orbit commsats while spacex received only nine with international launch services proton and united launch alliance signing one contract each in addition arianespace signed their largest launch contract ever—for 21 leo launches for oneweb using the europeanized russian soyuz launch vehicle launching from the esa spaceport—and two vega smallsat launchesthe launch of the us air forces first gps iii satellite is expected no earlier than 2017 rather than 2016 as originally planned ula—after having held a government-sanctioned monopoly on us military launches for the previous decade—declined to even submit a bid  leaving the likely contract award winner to be spacex the only other domestic us provider of launch services to be certified as usable by the us military


 since 2016 
spacexs market share increased rapidly in 2016 spacex had 30% global market share for newly awarded commercial launch contracts in 2017 the market share reached 45 the estimate for 2018 is about 65% as of july 2018


 launch industry response 
in addition to price reductions for proffered launch service contracts launch service providers are restructuring to meet increased competitive pressures within the industry
ula has begun a major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease launch costs by half in may 2015 ula announced it would decrease its executive ranks by 30 percent in december 2015 with the layoff of 12 executives the management layoffs are the beginning of a major reorganization and redesign as ula endeavours to slash costs and hunt out new customers to ensure continued growth despite the rise of spacexaccording to one arianespace managing director its quite clear theres a very significant challenge coming from spacex he said therefore things have to change - and the european industry is being restructured consolidated rationalised and streamlined jean botti chief technology officer for airbus which makes the ariane 5 warned that those who dont take elon musk seriously will have a lot to worry aboutairbus announced in 2015 that they would open a rd center and venture capital fund in silicon valley airbus ceo fabrice bregier stated what is the weakness of a big group like airbus when we talk about innovation we believe that we have better ideas than the rest of the world we believe that we know because we control the technologies and platforms the world has shown us in the car industry the space industry and the hi-tech industry that this is not true and we need to be open to others ideas and others innovationsairbus group ceo tom enders said the only way to do it for big companies is really to create spaces outside of the main business where we allow and where we incentivize experimentation  that is what we have started to do but there is no manual  it is a little bit of trial and error we all feel challenged by what the internet companies are doing
following a spacex launch vehicle failure in june 2015—due to the lower prices increased flexibility for partial-payload launches of the ariane heavy lifter and decreased cost of operations of the esa guiana space center spaceport—arianespace regained the competitive lead in commercial launch contracts signed in 2015 spacex successful recovery of a first stage rocket in december 2015 has not changed the arianespace outlook  arianespace ceo israel stated that the challenges of reusability  have not disappeared  the stress on stage or engine structures of high-speed passage through the atmosphere the performance penalty of reserving fuel for the return flight instead of maximizing rocket lift capacity the need for many annual launches to make the economics work – all remain issuesdespite ula restructuring begun in 2014 to decrease launch costs by half the cheapest ula space launch in early 2018 remains the atlas v 401 at a price of approximately us109 million more than us40 million more than a spacex standard commercial launch which the us military began to utilize for some us government missions flying in 2018
by early 2018 two european space agencies—cnes and dlr—are to begin developing a new reusable engine aimed to be manufactured at one-tenth the cost of the ariane 5s first-stage engine prometheus its first flight test in a demonstration vehicle is expected in 2020 the goal is to establish a base of knowledge for future launch vehicles that could maybe be reusablein the market for launches of small satellites—including both rideshare launch services on medium-lift and heavy-lift launch vehicles and the developing capacity from small launch vehicles—prices were falling by early 2018 as more launch capacity entered the market cubesat launches that had previously cost us350–400 thousand had declined by march 2018 to us250 thousand and prices were continuing to decline new capacity from chinese long march and indian pslv medium-lift vehicles and a number of new small launchers from virgin orbit rocket lab firefly and a number of new chinese small launch vehicles are expected to put more downward pressure on prices while also increasing the ability of smallsats to purchase custom launch dates and launch orbits and increasing overall responsiveness to launch purchasersas recently as 2013 nearly half of the worlds commercial launch payloads were launched on russian launch vehicles by 2018 the russian launch service market share is projected to shrink to about 10% of the worlds commercial launch market russia only launched three commercial payloads in 2017  technical problems with the proton rocket and intense competition with spacex has been the prime drivers of this decline  spacexs share of the commercial market has grown from 0% in 2009 to a projected 50% for 2018 
by 2018 russia has indicated it may reduce focus on the commercial launch market on 17 april 2018 russias chief spaceflight official deputy prime minister dmitry rogozin said in an interview the share of launch vehicles is as small as four percent of the overall market of space services the four percent stake isn’t worth the effort to try to elbow musk and china aside payloads manufacturing is where good money can be madethe global launch market revenue from the 33 commercial orbital launches in 2017 is estimated to be only just over us3 billion the global space economy however is much larger at us345 billion in 2016 the launch industry is becoming increasingly competitive however to date there has been no indication of a large increase of launch opportunities in response to decreasing prices russia may be the first launch provider to be a casualty of over supply of launch servicesby may 2018 as spacex prepared to launch the first block 5 version of falcon 9 eric berger reported in ars technica that during the eight years since its maiden launch falcon 9 had become the dominant rocket globally through spacex efforts to take risks and relentlessly innovate driving efficiency upwards the first block 5 booster flew successfully on 11 may 2018 and spacex then lowered the standard price of a falcon 9 launch from us62 million to about us50 million this move further strengthens spacex’s competitiveness in the commercial launch market
in mid-2018 no fewer than three commercial launch vehicles—ariane 6 vulcan and new glenn—were being targeted for initial launch in 2020 two of them explicitly aimed at competitively responding to the offerings of spacexalthough journalists and industry experts were expressing doubts that these all these target dates would be met
in addition to building new launch vehicles and endeavoring to lower launch prices competitive responses may include new product offerings and now do include a more schedule-oriented launch cadence for dual-manifested payloads on offer from blue origin blue origin announced in 2018 they intend to contract for launch services a bit differently than the contract options that have been traditionally offered in the commercial launch market the company has stated they will support a regular launch cadence of up to eight launches per year if one of the payload providers for a multi-payload launch is not ready on time blue origin will hold to the launch timeframe and fly the remaining payloads on time at no increase in price
this is quite different from how dual-launch manifested contracts have been previously handled by arianespace ariane v and ariane 6 and mitsubishi heavy industries h-iia and h3 spacex and international launch services offer only dedicated launch contracts


 effect on related industries 
satellite design and manufacturing is beginning to take advantage of these lower-cost options for space launch services
one such satellite system is the boeing 702sp which can be launched as a pair on a lighter-weight dual-commsat stack—two satellites conjoined on a single launch—and which was specifically designed to take advantage of the lower-cost spacex falcon 9 launch vehicle
the design was announced in 2012 and the first two commsats of this design were lofted in a paired launch in march 2015 for a record low launch price of approximately us30 million per gso commsat boeing ceo james mcnerney has indicated that spacexs growing presence in the space industry is forcing boeing to be more competitive in some segments of the marketearly information on a new constellation of 4000 satellites intended to provide global internet services along with a new factory dedicated to manufacturing low-cost smallsat satellites indicate that the satellite manufacturing industry may experience a supply shock similar to what the launcher industry is experiencing in the 2010sventure capital investor steve jurvetson has indicated that it is not merely the lower launch prices but the fact that the known prices act as a signal in conveying information to other entrepreneurs who then use that information to bring on new related ventures
