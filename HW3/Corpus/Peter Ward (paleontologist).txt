his parents joseph and ruth ward moved to seattle following world war ii ward grew up in the seward park neighborhood of seattle attending franklin high school and he spent time during summers at a family summer cabin on orcas islandwards academic career has included teaching posts and professional connections with ohio state university the nasa astrobiology institute the university of california mcmaster university where he received his phd in 1976 and the california institute of technology he was elected as a fellow of the california academy of sciences in 1984
ward specializes in the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event the permian–triassic extinction event and mass extinctions generally he has published books on biodiversity and the fossil record his 1992 book on methuselahs trail received a golden trilobite award from the paleontological society as the best popular science book of the year ward also serves as an adjunct professor of zoology and astronomy
his book the end of evolution was published in 1994 in it he discussed in three parts each about an extinction event on earth this book was rewritten and published in 2000 as rivers in time
ward is co-author along with astronomer donald brownlee of the best-selling rare earth why complex life is uncommon in the universe published in 2000 in that work the authors suggest that the universe is fundamentally hostile to advanced life and that while simple life might be abundant the likelihood of widespread lifeforms as advanced as those on earth is marginal in 2001 his book future evolution was published featuring illustrations by artist alexis rockmanward and brownlee are also co-authors of the book the life and death of planet earth how the new science of astrobiology charts the ultimate fate of the world which discusses the earths future and eventual demise as it is ultimately destroyed by a warming and expanding sun in this book ward and brownlee depict earths long-term future by comparing its lifespan to that of a typical humans pointing out that its systems that keep it habitable will gradually break down one by one like organs in a humans as he or she dies they also predict the earths eventual fate by compressing its 12 billion-year-old history to a clock spanning 12 hours with the first life appearing at 100 am and the first animals and plants appearing at 400 am with the present day being 429.59 am and even though the earth will be destroyed by the sun at high noon animals and plants will come to an end by 500 am the book actually picks up where rare earth has left off this time it talk about how and why the earth is actually not just rare in space but also in time all because of this see also future of the earth
according to wards 2007 book under a green sky global warming the mass extinctions of the past and what they can tell us about our future all but one of the major mass extinction events in history have been brought on by climate change the author argues that events in the past can give valuable information about the future of our planet reviewer doug brown goes further stating this is how the world ends scientists at the universities of york and leeds also warn that the fossil record supports evidence of impending mass extinction recently ward is slowly starting to shift his interest toward climate change because of his experiences with studying mass extinctions as well as justifying why intelligent life including humanity is especially even rarer than complex life in general in terms of both space and time as intelligent life only lasts for just a few thousand years before finally collapsing and going extinct as seen in the book the flooded earth however in 2014 ward returned to his roots as a paleontologist with his book a new history of life co-authored with joe kirschvink and in his upcoming 2018 book lamarcks revenge


 medea hypothesis 

the medea hypothesis is a term coined by ward for the anti-gaian hypothesis that multicellular life understood as a superorganism is suicidal
in this view microbial-triggered mass extinctions are attempts to return the earth to the microbial-dominated state it has been for most of its history
in 2009 ward wrote a book about this hypothesis under the same name
