switzerland officially the swiss confederation is a country situated in western central and southern europe it consists of 26 cantons and the city of bern is the seat of the federal authorities the sovereign state is a federal republic bordered by italy to the south france to the west germany to the north and austria and liechtenstein to the east switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the alps the swiss plateau and the jura spanning a total area of 41,285 km2 15,940 sq mi land area 39,997 km2 15,443 sq mi while the alps occupy the greater part of the territory the swiss population of approximately 8.5 million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau where the largest cities are to be found among them are the two global cities and economic centres zürich and geneva
the establishment of the old swiss confederacy dates to the late medieval period resulting from a series of military successes against austria and burgundy swiss independence from the holy roman empire was formally recognized in the peace of westphalia in 1648 the country has a history of armed neutrality going back to the reformation it has not been in a state of war internationally since 1815 and did not join the united nations until 2002 nevertheless it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world in addition to being the birthplace of the red cross switzerland is home to numerous international organisations including the second largest un office on the european level it is a founding member of the european free trade association but notably not part of the european union the european economic area or the eurozone however it participates in the schengen area and the european single market through bilateral treaties
spanning the intersection of germanic and romance europe switzerland comprises four main linguistic and cultural regions german french italian and romansh although the majority of the population are german-speaking swiss national identity is rooted in a common historical background shared values such as federalism and direct democracy and alpine symbolism due to its linguistic diversity switzerland is known by a variety of native names schweiz ˈʃvaɪts german suisse sɥisə french svizzera ˈzvittsera italian and svizra ˈʒviːtsrɐ or ˈʒviːtsʁːɐ romansh on coins and stamps the latin name – frequently shortened to helvetia – is used instead of the four national languages
switzerland is one of the most developed countries in the world with the highest nominal wealth per adult and the eighth-highest per capita gross domestic product according to the imf switzerland ranks at or near the top globally in several metrics of national performance including government transparency civil liberties quality of life economic competitiveness and human development zürich geneva and basel have all three been ranked among the top ten cities in the world in terms of quality of life with the first ranked second globally according to mercer in 2018


 etymology 

the english name switzerland is a compound containing switzer an obsolete term for the swiss which was in use during the 16th to 19th centuries the english adjective swiss is a loan from french suisse also in use since the 16th century the name switzer is from the alemannic schwiizer in origin an inhabitant of schwyz and its associated territory one of the waldstätten cantons which formed the nucleus of the old swiss confederacy the swiss began to adopt the name for themselves after the swabian war of 1499 used alongside the term for confederates eidgenossen literally comrades by oath used since the 14th century the data code for switzerland ch is derived from latin confoederatio helvetica english helvetic confederation
the toponym schwyz itself was first attested in 972 as old high german suittes ultimately perhaps related to swedan ‘to burn’ cf old norse svíða ‘to singe burn’ referring to the area of forest that was burned and cleared to build the name was extended to the area dominated by the canton and after the swabian war of 1499 gradually came to be used for the entire confederation
the swiss german name of the country schwiiz is homophonous to that of the canton and the settlement but distinguished by the use of the definite article dschwiiz for the confederation but simply schwyz for the canton and the townthe latin name confoederatio helvetica was neologized and introduced gradually after the formation of the federal state in 1848 harking back to the napoleonic helvetic republic appearing on coins from 1879 inscribed on the federal palace in 1902 and after 1948 used in the official seal for example the iso banking code chf for the swiss franc and the country top-level domain ch are both taken from the states latin name helvetica is derived from the helvetii a gaulish tribe living on the swiss plateau before the roman era
helvetia appears as a national personification of the swiss confederacy in the 17th century with a 1672 play by johann caspar weissenbach


 history 

switzerland has existed as a state in its present form since the adoption of the swiss federal constitution in 1848 the precursors of switzerland established a protective alliance at the end of the 13th century 1291 forming a loose confederation of states which persisted for centuries


 early history 

the oldest traces of hominid existence in switzerland date back about 150,000 years the oldest known farming settlements in switzerland which were found at gächlingen have been dated to around 5300 bc

the earliest known cultural tribes of the area were members of the hallstatt and la tène cultures named after the archaeological site of la tène on the north side of lake neuchâtel la tène culture developed and flourished during the late iron age from around 450 bc possibly under some influence from the greek and etruscan civilisations one of the most important tribal groups in the swiss region was the helvetii steadily harassed by the germanic tribes in 58 bc the helvetii decided to abandon the swiss plateau and migrate to western gallia but julius caesars armies pursued and defeated them at the battle of bibracte in todays eastern france forcing the tribe to move back to its original homeland in 15 bc tiberius who would one day become the second roman emperor and his brother drusus conquered the alps integrating them into the roman empire the area occupied by the helvetii—the namesakes of the later confoederatio helvetica—first became part of romes gallia belgica province and then of its germania superior province while the eastern portion of modern switzerland was integrated into the roman province of raetia sometime around the start of the common era the romans maintained a large legionary camp called vindonissa now a ruin at the confluence of the aare and reuss rivers near the town of windisch an outskirt of brugg
the first and second century ad was an age of prosperity for the population living on the swiss plateau several towns like aventicum iulia equestris and augusta raurica reached a remarkable size while hundreds of agricultural estates villae rusticae were founded in the countryside
around 260 ad the fall of the agri decumates territory north of the rhine transformed todays switzerland into a frontier land of the empire repeated raids by the alamanni tribes provoked the ruin of the roman towns and economy forcing the population to find shelter near roman fortresses like the castrum rauracense near augusta raurica the empire built another line of defence at the north border the so-called donau-iller-rhine-limes but at the end of the fourth century the increased germanic pressure forced the romans to abandon the linear defence concept and the swiss plateau was finally open to the settlement of germanic tribes
in the early middle ages from the end of the 4th century the western extent of modern-day switzerland was part of the territory of the kings of the burgundians the alemanni settled the swiss plateau in the 5th century and the valleys of the alps in the 8th century forming alemannia modern-day switzerland was therefore then divided between the kingdoms of alemannia and burgundy the entire region became part of the expanding frankish empire in the 6th century following clovis is victory over the alemanni at tolbiac in 504 ad and later frankish domination of the burgundiansthroughout the rest of the 6th 7th and 8th centuries the swiss regions continued under frankish hegemony merovingian and carolingian dynasties but after its extension under charlemagne the frankish empire was divided by the treaty of verdun in 843 the territories of present-day switzerland became divided into middle francia and east francia until they were reunified under the holy roman empire around 1000 adby 1200 the swiss plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of savoy zähringer habsburg and kyburg some regions uri schwyz unterwalden later known as waldstätten were accorded the imperial immediacy to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes with the extinction of its male line in 1263 the kyburg dynasty fell in ad 1264 then the habsburgs under king rudolph i holy roman emperor in 1273 laid claim to the kyburg lands and annexed them extending their territory to the eastern swiss plateau


 old swiss confederacy 

the old swiss confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the central alps the confederacy governed by nobles and patricians of various cantons facilitated management of common interests and ensured peace on the important mountain trade routes the federal charter of 1291 agreed between the rural communes of uri schwyz and unterwalden is considered the confederacys founding document even though similar alliances are likely to have existed decades earlier

by 1353 the three original cantons had joined with the cantons of glarus and zug and the lucerne zürich and bern city states to form the old confederacy of eight states that existed until the end of the 15th century the expansion led to increased power and wealth for the confederation by 1460 the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the rhine to the alps and the jura mountains particularly after victories against the habsburgs battle of sempach battle of näfels over charles the bold of burgundy during the 1470s and the success of the swiss mercenaries the swiss victory in the swabian war against the swabian league of emperor maximilian i in 1499 amounted to de facto independence within the holy roman empirethe old swiss confederacy had acquired a reputation of invincibility during these earlier wars but expansion of the confederation suffered a setback in 1515 with the swiss defeat in the battle of marignano this ended the so-called heroic epoch of swiss history the success of zwinglis reformation in some cantons led to inter-cantonal religious conflicts in 1529 and 1531 wars of kappel it was not until more than one hundred years after these internal wars that in 1648 under the peace of westphalia european countries recognised switzerlands independence from the holy roman empire and its neutralityduring the early modern period of swiss history the growing authoritarianism of the patriciate families combined with a financial crisis in the wake of the thirty years war led to the swiss peasant war of 1653 in the background to this struggle the conflict between catholic and protestant cantons persisted erupting in further violence at the first war of villmergen in 1656 and the toggenburg war or second war of villmergen in 1712


 napoleonic era 

in 1798 the revolutionary french government conquered switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution this centralised the government of the country effectively abolishing the cantons moreover mülhausen joined france and the valtellina valley became part of the cisalpine republic separating from switzerland the new regime known as the helvetic republic was highly unpopular it had been imposed by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition making switzerland nothing more than a french satellite state the fierce french suppression of the nidwalden revolt in september 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the french army and the local populations resistance to the occupation
when war broke out between france and its rivals russian and austrian forces invaded switzerland the swiss refused to fight alongside the french in the name of the helvetic republic in 1803 napoleon organised a meeting of the leading swiss politicians from both sides in paris the result was the act of mediation which largely restored swiss autonomy and introduced a confederation of 19 cantons henceforth much of swiss politics would concern balancing the cantons tradition of self-rule with the need for a central government
in 1815 the congress of vienna fully re-established swiss independence and the european powers agreed to permanently recognise swiss neutrality swiss troops still served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the siege of gaeta the treaty also allowed switzerland to increase its territory with the admission of the cantons of valais neuchâtel and geneva switzerlands borders have not changed since except for some minor adjustments


 federal state 

the restoration of power to the patriciate was only temporary after a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes such as the züriputsch of 1839 civil war the sonderbundskrieg broke out in 1847 when some catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance the sonderbund the war lasted for less than a month causing fewer than 100 casualties most of which were through friendly fire yet however minor the sonderbundskrieg appears compared with other european riots and wars in the 19th century it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the swiss and of switzerland
the war convinced most swiss of the need for unity and strength towards its european neighbours swiss people from all strata of society whether catholic or protestant from the liberal or conservative current realised that the cantons would profit more if their economic and religious interests were merged
thus while the rest of europe saw revolutionary uprisings the swiss drew up a constitution which provided for a federal layout much of it inspired by the american example this constitution provided for a central authority while leaving the cantons the right to self-government on local issues giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons the sonderbund kantone the national assembly was divided between an upper house the council of states two representatives per canton and a lower house the national council with representatives elected from across the country referendums were made mandatory for any amendment of this constitution this new constitution also brought a legal end to nobility in switzerland

a system of single weights and measures was introduced and in 1850 the swiss franc became the swiss single currency article 11 of the constitution forbade sending troops to serve abroad with the exception of serving the holy see though the swiss were still obliged to serve francis ii of the two sicilies with swiss guards present at the siege of gaeta in 1860 marking the end of foreign service
an important clause of the constitution was that it could be re-written completely if this was deemed necessary thus enabling it to evolve as a whole rather than being modified one amendment at a timethis need soon proved itself when the rise in population and the industrial revolution that followed led to calls to modify the constitution accordingly an early draft was rejected by the population in 1872 but modifications led to its acceptance in 1874 it introduced the facultative referendum for laws at the federal level it also established federal responsibility for defence trade and legal matters
in 1891 the constitution was revised with unusually strong elements of direct democracy which remain unique even today


 modern history 

switzerland was not invaded during either of the world wars during world war i switzerland was home to vladimir illych ulyanov vladimir lenin and he remained there until 1917 swiss neutrality was seriously questioned by the grimm–hoffmann affair in 1917 but it was short-lived in 1920 switzerland joined the league of nations which was based in geneva on condition that it was exempt from any military requirements
during world war ii detailed invasion plans were drawn up by the germans but switzerland was never attacked switzerland was able to remain independent through a combination of military deterrence concessions to germany and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion under general henri guisan appointed the commander-in-chief for the duration of the war a general mobilisation of the armed forces was ordered the swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland to one of organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong well-stockpiled positions high in the alps known as the reduit switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the axis and allied powersswitzerlands trade was blockaded by both the allies and by the axis economic cooperation and extension of credit to the third reich varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion and the availability of other trading partners concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through vichy france was severed in 1942 leaving switzerland together with liechtenstein entirely isolated from the wider world by axis controlled territory over the course of the war switzerland interned over 300,000 refugees and the international red cross based in geneva played an important part during the conflict strict immigration and asylum policies as well as the financial relationships with nazi germany raised controversy but not until the end of the 20th centuryduring the war the swiss air force engaged aircraft of both sides shooting down 11 intruding luftwaffe planes in may and june 1940 then forcing down other intruders after a change of policy following threats from germany over 100 allied bombers and their crews were interned during the war between 1940 and 1945 switzerland was bombed by the allies causing fatalities and property damage among the cities and towns bombed were basel brusio chiasso cornol geneva koblenz niederweningen rafz renens samedan schaffhausen stein am rhein tägerwilen thayngen vals and zürich allied forces explained the bombings which violated the 96th article of war resulted from navigation errors equipment failure weather conditions and errors made by bomber pilots the swiss expressed fear and concern that the bombings were intended to put pressure on switzerland to end economic cooperation and neutrality with nazi germany court-martial proceedings took place in england and the us government paid 62,176,433.06 in swiss francs for reparations of the bombings
after the war the swiss government exported credits through the charitable fund known as the schweizerspende and also donated to the marshall plan to help europes recovery efforts that ultimately benefited the swiss economyduring the cold war swiss authorities considered the construction of a swiss nuclear bomb leading nuclear physicists at the federal institute of technology zürich such as paul scherrer made this a realistic possibility in 1988 the paul scherrer institute was founded in his name to explore the therapeutic uses of neutron scattering technologies financial problems with the defence budget and ethical considerations prevented the substantial funds from being allocated and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of 1968 was seen as a valid alternative all remaining plans for building nuclear weapons were dropped by 1988switzerland was the last western republic to grant women the right to vote some swiss cantons approved this in 1959 while at the federal level it was achieved in 1971 and after resistance in the last canton appenzell innerrhoden one of only two remaining landsgemeinde in 1990 after obtaining suffrage at the federal level women quickly rose in political significance with the first woman on the seven member federal council executive being elisabeth kopp who served from 1984 to 1989 and the first female president being ruth dreifuss in 1999

switzerland joined the council of europe in 1963 in 1979 areas from the canton of bern attained independence from the bernese forming the new canton of jura on 18 april 1999 the swiss population and the cantons voted in favour of a completely revised federal constitutionin 2002 switzerland became a full member of the united nations leaving the vatican city as the last widely recognised state without full un membership switzerland is a founding member of the efta but is not a member of the european economic area an application for membership in the european union was sent in may 1992 but not advanced since the eea was rejected in december 1992 when switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the eea there have since been several referendums on the eu issue due to opposition from the citizens the membership application has been withdrawn nonetheless swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the eu and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the european union switzerland together with liechtenstein has been completely surrounded by the eu since austrias entry in 1995 on 5 june 2005 swiss voters agreed by a 55% majority to join the schengen treaty a result that was regarded by eu commentators as a sign of support by switzerland a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies


 geography 

extending across the north and south side of the alps in west-central europe switzerland encompasses a great diversity of landscapes and climates on a limited area of 41,285 square kilometres 15,940 sq mi the population is about 8 million resulting in an average population density of around 195 people per square kilometre 500sq mi the more mountainous southern half of the country is far more sparsely populated than the northern half in the largest canton of graubünden lying entirely in the alps population density falls to 27 km² 70 sq miswitzerland lies between latitudes 45° and 48° n and longitudes 5° and 11° e it contains three basic topographical areas the swiss alps to the south the swiss plateau or central plateau and the jura mountains on the west the alps are a high mountain range running across the central-south of the country comprising about 60% of the countrys total area the majority of the swiss population live in the swiss plateau among the high valleys of the swiss alps many glaciers are found totalling an area of 1,063 square kilometres 410 sq mi from these originate the headwaters of several major rivers such as the rhine inn ticino and rhône which flow in the four cardinal directions into the whole of europe the hydrographic network includes several of the largest bodies of freshwater in central and western europe among which are included lake geneva also called le lac léman in french lake constance known as bodensee in german and lake maggiore switzerland has more than 1500 lakes and contains 6% of europes stock of fresh water lakes and glaciers cover about 6% of the national territory the largest lake is lake geneva in western switzerland shared with france the rhône is both the main source and outflow of lake geneva lake constance is the second largest swiss lake and like the lake geneva an intermediate step by the rhine at the border to austria and germany while the rhône flows into the mediterranean sea at the french camargue region and the rhine flows into the north sea at rotterdam in the netherlands about 1,000 kilometres 620 miles apart both springs are only about 22 kilometres 14 miles apart from each other in the swiss alps

48 of switzerlands mountains are 4,000 metres 13,000 ft above sea in altitude or higher at 4,634 m 15,203 ft monte rosa is the highest although the matterhorn 4,478 m or 14,692 ft is often regarded as the most famous both are located within the pennine alps in the canton of valais on the border with italy the section of the bernese alps above the deep glacial lauterbrunnen valley containing 72 waterfalls is well known for the jungfrau 4,158 m or 13,642 ft eiger and mönch and the many picturesque valleys in the region in the southeast the long engadin valley encompassing the st moritz area in canton of graubünden is also well known the highest peak in the neighbouring bernina alps is piz bernina 4,049 m or 13,284 ftthe more populous northern part of the country comprising about 30% of the countrys total area is called the swiss plateau it has greater open and hilly landscapes partly forested partly open pastures usually with grazing herds or vegetables and fruit fields but it is still hilly there are large lakes found here and the biggest swiss cities are in this area of the countrywithin switzerland there are two small enclaves büsingen belongs to germany campione ditalia belongs to italy switzerland has no exclaves in other countries


 climate 

the swiss climate is generally temperate but can vary greatly between the localities from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the often pleasant near mediterranean climate at switzerlands southern tip there are some valley areas in the southern part of switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing the less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion during these periods thus seeing no sun for weeks
a weather phenomenon known as the föhn with an identical effect to the chinook wind can occur at all times of the year and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind bringing air of very low relative humidity to the north of the alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the alps this works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south valleys running south to north trigger the best effect
the driest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds lose a lot of their content while crossing the mountains before reaching these areas large alpine areas such as graubünden remain drier than pre-alpine areas and as in the main valley of the valais wine grapes are grown therethe wettest conditions persist in the high alps and in the ticino canton which has much sun yet heavy bursts of rain from time to time precipitation tends to be spread moderately throughout the year with a peak in summer autumn is the driest season winter receives less precipitation than summer yet the weather patterns in switzerland are not in a stable climate system and can be variable from year to year with no strict and predictable periods


 environment 
switzerlands ecosystems can be particularly fragile because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies the mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing the climatic geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change nevertheless according to the 2014 environmental performance index switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment due to its high scores on environmental public health its heavy reliance on renewable sources of energy hydropower and geothermal energy and its control of greenhouse gas emissions


 politics 

the federal constitution adopted in 1848 is the legal foundation of the modern federal state a new swiss constitution was adopted in 1999 but did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure it outlines basic and political rights of individuals and citizen participation in public affairs divides the powers between the confederation and the cantons and defines federal jurisdiction and authority there are three main governing bodies on the federal level the bicameral parliament legislative the federal council executive and the federal court judicial

the swiss parliament consists of two houses the council of states which has 46 representatives two from each canton and one from each half-canton who are elected under a system determined by each canton and the national council which consists of 200 members who are elected under a system of proportional representation depending on the population of each canton members of both houses serve for 4 years and only serve as members of parliament part-time so-called milizsystem or citizen legislature when both houses are in joint session they are known collectively as the federal assembly through referendums citizens may challenge any law passed by parliament and through initiatives introduce amendments to the federal constitution thus making switzerland a direct democracythe federal council constitutes the federal government directs the federal administration and serves as collective head of state it is a collegial body of seven members elected for a four-year mandate by the federal assembly which also exercises oversight over the council the president of the confederation is elected by the assembly from among the seven members traditionally in rotation and for a one-year term the president chairs the government and assumes representative functions however the president is a primus inter pares with no additional powers and remains the head of a department within the administrationthe swiss government has been a coalition of the four major political parties since 1959 each party having a number of seats that roughly reflects its share of electorate and representation in the federal parliament
the classic distribution of 2 cvppdc 2 spspss 2 fdpprd and 1 svpudc as it stood from 1959 to 2003 was known as the magic formula following the 2015 federal council elections the seven seats in the federal council were distributed as follows

1 seat for the christian democratic peoples party cvppdc
2 seats for the free democratic party fdpprd
2 seats for the social democratic party spspss
2 seats for the swiss peoples party svpudcthe function of the federal supreme court is to hear appeals against rulings of cantonal or federal courts the judges are elected by the federal assembly for six-year terms


 direct democracy 

direct democracy and federalism are hallmarks of the swiss political system swiss citizens are subject to three legal jurisdictions the municipality canton and federal levels the 1848 and 1999 swiss constitutions define a system of direct democracy sometimes called half-direct or representative direct democracy because it is aided by the more commonplace institutions of a representative democracy the instruments of this system at the federal level known as popular rights german volksrechte french droits populaires italian diritti popolari include the right to submit a federal initiative and a referendum both of which may overturn parliamentary decisionsby calling a federal referendum a group of citizens may challenge a law passed by parliament if they gather 50,000 signatures against the law within 100 days if so a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a simple majority whether to accept or reject the law any 8 cantons together can also call a constitutional referendum on a federal lawsimilarly the federal constitutional initiative allows citizens to put a constitutional amendment to a national vote if 100,000 voters sign the proposed amendment within 18 months the federal council and the federal assembly can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter-proposal and then voters must indicate a preference on the ballot in case both proposals are accepted constitutional amendments whether introduced by initiative or in parliament must be accepted by a double majority of the national popular vote and the cantonal popular votes


 cantons 

the swiss confederation consists of 26 cantons
these cantons are known as half-cantons
the cantons are federated states have a permanent constitutional status and in comparison with the situation in other countries a high degree of independence under the federal constitution all 26 cantons are equal in status except that 6 referred to often as the half-cantons are represented by only one councillor instead of two in the council of states and have only half a cantonal vote with respect to the required cantonal majority in referendums on constitutional amendments each canton has its own constitution and its own parliament government police and courts however there are considerable differences between the individual cantons most particularly in terms of population and geographical area their populations vary between 16,003 appenzell innerrhoden and 1,487,969 zürich and their area between 37 km2 14 sq mi basel-stadt and 7,105 km2 2,743 sq mi grisons


 municipalities 
the cantons comprise a total of 2,222 municipalities as of 2018


 foreign relations and international institutions 

traditionally switzerland avoids alliances that might entail military political or direct economic action and has been neutral since the end of its expansion in 1515 its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at the congress of vienna in 1815 only in 2002 did switzerland become a full member of the united nations and it was the first state to join it by referendum switzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and historically has served as an intermediary between other states switzerland is not a member of the european union the swiss people have consistently rejected membership since the early 1990s however switzerland does participate in the schengen area

a large number of international institutions have their seats in switzerland in part because of its policy of neutrality geneva is the birthplace of the red cross and red crescent movement and the geneva conventions and since 2006 hosts the united nations human rights council even though switzerland is one of the most recent countries to have joined the united nations the palace of nations in geneva is the second biggest centre for the united nations after new york and switzerland was a founding member and home to the league of nations
apart from the united nations headquarters the swiss confederation is host to many un agencies like the world health organization who the international labour organization ilo the international telecommunication union itu the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr and about 200 other international organisations including the world trade organization and the world intellectual property organization the annual meetings of the world economic forum in davos bring together top international business and political leaders from switzerland and foreign countries to discuss important issues facing the world including health and the environment additionally the headquarters of the bank for international settlements bis are located in basel since 1930
furthermore many sport federations and organisations are located throughout the country such as the international basketball federation in geneva the union of european football associations uefa in nyon the international federation of association football fifa and the international ice hockey federation both in zürich the international cycling union in aigle and the international olympic committee in lausanne


 military 

the swiss armed forces including the land forces and the air force are composed mostly of conscripts male citizens aged from 20 to 34 in special cases up to 50 years being a landlocked country switzerland has no navy however on lakes bordering neighbouring countries armed military patrol boats are used swiss citizens are prohibited from serving in foreign armies except for the swiss guards of the vatican or if they are dual citizens of a foreign country and reside there
the structure of the swiss militia system stipulates that the soldiers keep their army issued equipment including all personal weapons at home some organisations and political parties find this practice controversial women can serve voluntarily men usually receive military conscription orders for training at the age of 18 about two thirds of the young swiss are found suited for service for those found unsuited various forms of alternative service exist annually approximately 20,000 persons are trained in recruit centres for a duration from 18 to 21 weeks the reform army xxi was adopted by popular vote in 2003 it replaced the previous model army 95 reducing the effectives from 400,000 to about 200,000 of those 120,000 are active in periodic army training and 80,000 are non-training reserves

overall three general mobilisations have been declared to ensure the integrity and neutrality of switzerland the first one was held on the occasion of the franco-prussian war of 1870–71 the second was in response to the outbreak of the first world war in august 1914 the third mobilisation of the army took place in september 1939 in response to the german attack on poland henri guisan was elected as the general-in-chief
because of its neutrality policy the swiss army does not currently take part in armed conflicts in other countries but is part of some peacekeeping missions around the world since 2000 the armed force department has also maintained the onyx intelligence gathering system to monitor satellite communicationsfollowing the end of the cold war there have been a number of attempts to curb military activity or even abolish the armed forces altogether a notable referendum on the subject launched by an anti-militarist group was held on 26 november 1989 it was defeated with about two thirds of the voters against the proposal a similar referendum called for before but held shortly after the 11 september attacks in the us was defeated by over 78% of votersgun politics in switzerland are unique in europe in that 29% of citizens are legally armed the large majority of firearms kept at home are issued by the swiss army but ammunition is no longer issued


 the capital or federal city issue 
until 1848 the rather loosely coupled confederation did not know a central political organisation but representatives mayors and landammänner met several times a year at the capital of the lieu presiding the confederal diet for one year
