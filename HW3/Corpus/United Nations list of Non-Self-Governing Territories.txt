the united nations list of non-self-governing territories is a list of places that the united nations general assembly deems to be non-self-governing and subject to the decolonization process chapter xi of the united nations charter embodies a declaration on non-self-governing territories which declares that the interests of the occupants of dependent territories are paramount and requires member states of the united nations in control of non-self-governing territories to submit annual information reports concerning the development of those territories since 1946 the general assembly has maintained a list of non-self governing territories under member states control since its inception dozens of territories have been removed from the list typically when they attained independence or internal self-government while other territories have been added as new administering countries joined the united nations or the general assembly reassessed the status of certain territories


 history 
the united nations charter contains a declaration concerning non-self-governing territories in chapter xi of said charter the declaration regarding non-self-governing territories specifically the article 73 point e in the charter it states that all member states agree to report to the united nations annually on the development of non-self-governing territories under their control the initial list of non-self-governing territories was created by compiling lists of dependent territories submitted by the administering states themselves in several instances administering states were later allowed to remove dependent territories from the list either unilaterally as in the case of many french overseas departments and territories or by vote of the general assembly as in the cases of puerto rico greenland the netherlands antilles and suriname

the list draws its origins from the period of colonialism and the charters concept of non-self-governing territories as an increasing number of formerly colonized countries became un members the general assembly increasingly asserted its authority to place additional territories on the list and repeatedly declared that only the general assembly had the authority to authorize a territorys being removed from the list upon attainment of any status other than full independence for example when portugal joined the united nations it contended that it controlled no non-self-governing territories claiming that areas such as angola and mozambique were an integral part of the portuguese state but the general assembly rejected this position similarly western sahara was added in 1963 when it was a spanish colony the same can be said about the situation of namibia removed upon its independence in 1990 which was seen due to its former status as a league of nations mandate territory as a vestige of german colonial legacy in africa a set of criteria for determining whether a territory is to be considered non-self-governing was established in general assembly resolution 1541 xv of 1960
also in 1960 the general assembly adopted resolution 1514 xv promulgating the declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples which declared that all remaining non-self-governing territories and trust territories were entitled to self-determination and independence  the following year the general assembly established the special committee on the situation with regard to the implementation of the declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples sometimes referred to as the special committee on decolonization or the committee of 24 because for much of its history the committee was composed of 24 members which reviews the situation in non-self-governing territories each year and reports to the general assembly

 criticism 
the list remains controversial for various reasons


 referenda 
one reason for controversy is that the list includes some dependencies that have democratically chosen to maintain their current status or have had referenda in which an insufficient percentage of the population vote for a change of status or in some cases such as united states virgin islands simply had an insufficient number of voters participate
gibraltar is a prime example of resident desires to remain with the status quo gibraltar a largely self-governing british territory on the tip of the iberian peninsula whose territory is claimed by spain has twice held a referendum to resolve its status in the first referendum held in 1967 the choices in the ballot were either to retain their current status or to become part of spain the status quo was favoured by 12,138 votes to 44 in the second referendum held in 2002 a proposal for a joint british–spanish administration of the territory was proposed and was voted down by 17,900 votes to 187 – the no vote accounting for more than 85% of gibraltars entire voting population neither of the referenda however gained recognition from the un with the 1967 referendum being declared to be in contravention of previous un resolutions the spanish position upheld by the un does not recognize any right to self-determination to the current gibraltar inhabitants since they are not the original population of the enclave but residents transferred by the colonial power the united kingdom 
the territory of tokelau divides political opinion in new zealand in response to attempts at decolonizing tokelau new zealand journalist michael field wrote in 2004 the un  is anxious to rid the world of the last remaining vestiges of colonialism by the end of the decade it has a list of 16 territories around the world virtually none of which wants to be independent to any degree field further notes that patuki isaako who was head of tokelaus government at the time of a un seminar on decolonization in 2004 informed the united nations that his country had no wish to be decolonized and that tokelauans had opposed the idea of decolonization ever since the first visit by un officials in 1976
in 2006 a un-supervised referendum on decolonization was held in tokelau where 60.07% of voters supported the offer of self-government  however the terms of the referendum required a two-thirds majority to vote in favor of self-government a second referendum was held in 2007 in which 64.40% of tokelauans supported self-government falling short of the two-thirds majority by 16 votes this led new zealand politician and former diplomat john hayes on behalf of the national party to state that tokelau did the right thing to resist pressure from the new zealand government and the united nations to pursue self-government in may 2008 the united nations secretary general ban ki-moon urged colonial powers to complete the decolonization process in every one of the remaining 16 non-self-governing territories this led the new zealand herald to comment that the united nations was apparently frustrated by two failed attempts to get tokelau to vote for independence from new zealandin march 2013 the autonomous government of the falkland islands organised a referendum as to whether the territory should remain a british overseas territory with a 92% turnout 99.8% of falkland islanders voted to maintain that status only three islanders favoured changing it


 viability 
a lack of population and landmass is an issue for at least one territory included on the list the british overseas territory pitcairn islands with a population of 49 and a total area of 47 km2 18.1 sq mi it is too small to be realistically viable as an independent state four other territories—tokelau montserrat the falkland islands and saint helena—are less populous than any un member state presentlyin addition some territories are financially dependent on their administering state


 completely autonomous dependencies 

another criticism is that a number of the listed territories such as bermuda see politics of bermuda falkland islands and gibraltar consider themselves completely autonomous and self-governing with the administering power retaining limited oversight over matters such as defence and diplomacy in past years there were ongoing disputes between some administering powers and the decolonization committee over whether territories such as pre-independence brunei and the west indies associated states should still be considered non-self-governing particularly in instances where the administering country was prepared to grant full independence whenever the territory requested it these disputes became moot as those territories eventually received full independence


 removed under other circumstances 
territories that have achieved a status described by the administering countries as internally self-governing – such as puerto rico the netherlands antilles and the cook islands – have been removed from the list by vote of the general assembly often under pressure of the administering countries in 1972 for example hong kong then administered by the united kingdom and macau then administered by portugal were removed from the list at the request of the peoples republic of china which had just been recognized as holding chinas seat at the united nationssome territories that have been annexed and incorporated into the legal framework of the controlling state such as the overseas departments of france are considered by the un to have been decolonized since they then no longer constitute non-self-governing entities their populations are assumed to have agreed to merge with the former parent state however in 1961 the general assembly voted to end this treatment for the overseas provinces of portugal such as angola and mozambique which were active foci of united nations attention until they attained independence in the mid-1970s


 change of status 
on 2 december 1986 new caledonia an overseas territory of france was reinstated on the list of non-self-governing territories an action to which france objected within france it has had the status of a collectivité sui generis or a one-of-a-kind community since 1999 under the 1998 nouméa accord its territorial congress has the right to call for a referendum on independence between 2014 and 2018 this referendum was held on 4th november 2018 with independence being rejected
french polynesia was also reinstated on the list on 17 may 2013 in somewhat contentious circumstances having been re-elected president of french polynesia in 2011 the territory being largely self-governing oscar temaru asked for it to be re-inscribed on the list it had been removed in 1947 french polynesia is categorised by france as an overseas country in recognition of its self-governing status on 5 may 2013 temarus union for democracy party lost the legislative election to gaston flosses pro-autonomy but anti-independence tahoeraa huiraatira party at this stage the united nations general assembly was due to discuss french polynesias re-inscription on the list twelve days later in accordance with a motion tabled by the solomon islands tuvalu and nauru on 16 may the assembly of french polynesia with its new anti-independence majority adopted a motion asking the united nations not to restore the country to the list on 17 may despite french polynesias opposition and frances the country was restored to the list of non-self-governing territories temaru was present for the vote on the final day of his mandate as president the united nations affirmed the inalienable right of the people of french polynesia to self-determination and independence


 list not complete 

also controversial are the criteria set down in 1960 to 1961 by the united nations general assembly resolution 1514 xv  united nations general assembly resolution 1541 xv principle 12 of the annex and united nations general assembly resolution 1654 xvi which only focused on colonies of the western world namely australia belgium denmark france italy netherlands new zealand portugal south africa spain the united kingdom and the united states this list of administering states was not expanded afterwardsnevertheless some of the 111 members who joined the un after 1960 gained independence from countries not covered by resolution 1541 and were themselves not classified as non-self-governing territories by the un of these that joined the un between 1960 and 2008 11 were independent before 1960 and 71 were included on the list some as a group twenty new un countries resulted from breakup of second world states six were part of yugoslavia two were part of czechoslovakia and 12 were part of the soviet union ukraine and belarus already had un seats before the dissolution of the ussr whose seat was reused by the russian federation without acceding anew out of the other nine seven mostly arab were colonies or protectorates of the western countries and one each was a non-self-governing part of ethiopia later independent eritrea and pakistan east pakistan later independent bangladesh territories like tibet administered by china and siberia or parts thereof administered by the soviet union later by russia have never been on the list western new guinea also known as west papua annexed against its will by indonesia is also not on the list as well as sarawak and sabah which were handed to malaya during its territorial expansion through the formation of malaysia in 1963 in 2018 the government of vanuatu is seeking international support to have west papua added to the list in 2019
