following the discovery of the planet neptune in 1846 there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit the search began in the mid-19th century and continued at the start of the 20th with percival lowells quest for planet x lowell proposed the planet x hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets particularly uranus and neptune speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed uranus enough to account for the irregularitiesclyde tombaughs discovery of pluto in 1930 appeared to validate lowells hypothesis and pluto was officially named the ninth planet in 1978 pluto was conclusively determined to be too small for its gravity to affect the giant planets resulting in a brief search for a tenth planet the search was largely abandoned in the early 1990s when a study of measurements made by the voyager 2 spacecraft found that the irregularities observed in uranuss orbit were due to a slight overestimation of neptunes mass after 1992 the discovery of numerous small icy objects with similar or even wider orbits than pluto led to a debate over whether pluto should remain a planet or whether it and its neighbours should like the asteroids be given their own separate classification although a number of the larger members of this group were initially described as planets in 2006 the international astronomical union iau reclassified pluto and its largest neighbours as dwarf planets leaving neptune the farthest known planet in the solar systemwhile the astronomical community widely agrees that planet x as originally envisioned does not exist the concept of an as-yet-unobserved planet has been revived by a number of astronomers to explain other anomalies observed in the outer solar system as of march 2014 observations with the wise telescope have ruled out the possibility of a saturn-sized object 95 earth masses out to 10,000 au and a jupiter-sized ≈318 earth masses or larger object out to 26,000 auin 2014 based on similarities of the orbits of a group of recently discovered extreme trans-neptunian objects astronomers hypothesized the existence of a super-earth planet 2 to 15 times the mass of the earth and beyond 200 au with possibly a high inclined orbit at some 1,500 au in 2016 further work showed this unknown distant planet is likely on an inclined eccentric orbit that goes no closer than about 200 au and no farther than about 1,200 au from the sun the orbit is predicted to be anti-aligned to the clustered extreme trans-neptunian objects because pluto is no longer considered a planet by the iau this new hypothetical object has become known as planet nine


 early speculation 

in the 1840s the french mathematician urbain le verrier used newtonian mechanics to analyse perturbations in the orbit of uranus and hypothesised that they were caused by the gravitational pull of a yet-undiscovered planet le verrier predicted the position of this new planet and sent his calculations to german astronomer johann gottfried galle on 23 september 1846 the night following his receipt of the letter galle and his student heinrich darrest discovered neptune exactly where le verrier had predicted there remained some slight discrepancies in the giant planets orbits these were taken to indicate the existence of yet another planet orbiting beyond neptune
even before neptunes discovery some speculated that one planet alone was not enough to explain the discrepancy on 17 november 1834 the british amateur astronomer the reverend thomas john hussey reported a conversation he had had with french astronomer alexis bouvard to george biddell airy the british astronomer royal hussey reported that when he suggested to bouvard that the unusual motion of uranus might be due to the gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet bouvard replied that the idea had occurred to him and that he had corresponded with peter andreas hansen director of the seeberg observatory in gotha about the subject hansens opinion was that a single body could not adequately explain the motion of uranus and postulated that two planets lay beyond uranusin 1848 jacques babinet raised an objection to le verriers calculations claiming that neptunes observed mass was smaller and its orbit larger than le verrier had initially predicted he postulated based largely on simple subtraction from le verriers calculations that another planet of roughly 12 earth masses which he named hyperion must exist beyond neptune le verrier denounced babinets hypothesis saying there is absolutely nothing by which one could determine the position of another planet barring hypotheses in which imagination played too large a partin 1850 james ferguson assistant astronomer at the united states naval observatory noted that he had lost a star he had observed gr1719k which lt matthew maury the superintendent of the observatory claimed was evidence that it must be a new planet subsequent searches failed to recover the planet in a different position and in 1878 chf peters director of the hamilton college observatory in new york showed that the star had not in fact vanished and that the previous results had been due to human errorin 1879 camille flammarion noted that the comets 1862 iii and 1889 iii had aphelia of 47 and 49 au respectively suggesting that they might mark the orbital radius of an unknown planet that had dragged them into an elliptical orbit astronomer george forbes concluded on the basis of this evidence that two planets must exist beyond neptune he calculated based on the fact that four comets possessed aphelia at around 100 au and a further six with aphelia clustered at around 300 au the orbital elements of a pair of hypothetical trans-neptunian planets these elements concorded suggestively with those made independently by another astronomer named david peck todd suggesting to many that they might be valid however sceptics argued that the orbits of the comets involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results george forbes is today considered to be the first describing planet ninein 1900 and 1901 harvard college observatory director william henry pickering led two searches for trans-neptunian planets the first was begun by danish astronomer hans emil lau who after studying the data on the orbit of uranus from 1690 to 1895 concluded that one trans-neptunian planet alone could not account for the discrepancies in its orbit and postulated the position of two planets he believed were responsible the second was launched when gabriel dallet suggested that a single trans-neptunian planet lying at 47 au could account for the motion of uranus pickering agreed to examine plates for any suspected planets in neither case were any foundin 1909 thomas jefferson jackson see an astronomer with a reputation as an egocentric contrarian opined that there is certainly one most likely two and possibly three planets beyond neptune tentatively naming the first planet oceanus he placed their respective distances at 42 56 and 72 au from the sun he gave no indication as to how he determined their existence and no known searches were mounted to locate themin 1911 indian astronomer venkatesh p ketakar suggested the existence of two trans-neptunian planets which he named brahma and vishnu by reworking the patterns observed by pierre-simon laplace in the planetary satellites of jupiter and applying them to the outer planets the three inner galilean moons of jupiter io europa and ganymede are locked in a complicated 124 resonance called a laplace resonance ketakar suggested that uranus neptune and his hypothetical trans-neptunian planets were locked in laplace-like resonances his calculations predicted a mean distance for brahma of 38.95 au and an orbital period of 242.28 earth years 34 resonance with neptune when pluto was discovered 19 years later its mean distance of 39.48 au and orbital period of 248 earth years were close to ketakars prediction pluto in fact has a 23 resonance with neptune ketakar made no predictions for the orbital elements other than mean distance and period it is not clear how ketakar arrived at these figures and his second planet vishnu was never located


 planet x 

in 1894 with the help of william pickering percival lowell a wealthy bostonian founded the lowell observatory in flagstaff arizona in 1906 convinced he could resolve the conundrum of uranuss orbit he began an extensive project to search for a trans-neptunian planet which he named planet x a name previously used by gabriel dallet the x in the name represents an unknown and is pronounced as the letter as opposed to the roman numeral for 10 at the time planet x would have been the ninth planet lowells hope in tracking down planet x was to establish his scientific credibility which had eluded him due to his widely derided belief that channel-like features visible on the surface of mars were canals constructed by an intelligent civilizationlowells first search focused on the ecliptic the plane encompassed by the zodiac where the other planets in the solar system lie using a 5-inch photographic camera he manually examined over 200 three-hour exposures with a magnifying glass and found no planets at that time pluto was too far above the ecliptic to be imaged by the survey  after revising his predicted possible locations lowell conducted a second search from 1914 to 1916 in 1915 he published his memoir of a trans-neptunian planet in which he concluded that planet x had a mass roughly seven times that of earth—about half that of neptune—and a mean distance from the sun of 43 au he assumed planet x would be a large low-density object with a high albedo like the giant planets as a result it would show a disc with diameter of about one arcsecond and an apparent magnitude of between 12 and 13—bright enough to be spottedseparately in 1908 pickering announced that by analysing irregularities in uranuss orbit he had found evidence for a ninth planet his hypothetical planet which he termed planet o because it came after n ie neptune  possessed a mean orbital radius of 51.9 au and an orbital period of 373.5 years plates taken at his observatory in arequipa peru showed no evidence for the predicted planet and british astronomer p h cowell showed that the irregularities observed in uranuss orbit virtually disappeared once the planets displacement of longitude was taken into account lowell himself despite his close association with pickering dismissed planet o out of hand saying this planet is very properly designated o for it is nothing at all unbeknownst to pickering four of the photographic plates taken in the search for planet o by astronomers at the mount wilson observatory in 1919 captured images of pluto though this was only recognised years later pickering went on to suggest many other possible trans-neptunian planets up to the year 1932 which he named p q r s t and u none were ever detected


 discovery of pluto 

lowells sudden death in 1916 temporarily halted the search for planet x failing to find the planet according to one friend virtually killed him lowells widow constance engaged in a legal battle with the observatory over lowells legacy which halted the search for planet x for several years in 1925 the observatory obtained glass discs for a new 13 in 33 cm wide-field telescope to continue the search constructed with funds from abbott lawrence lowell percivals brother in 1929 the observatorys director vesto melvin slipher summarily handed the job of locating the planet to clyde tombaugh a 22-year-old kansas farm boy who had only just arrived at the lowell observatory after slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawingstombaughs task was to systematically capture sections of the night sky in pairs of images each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart he then placed both images of each section in a machine called a blink comparator which by exchanging images quickly created a time lapse illusion of the movement of any planetary body to reduce the chances that a faster-moving and thus closer object be mistaken for the new planet tombaugh imaged each region near its opposition point 180 degrees from the sun where the apparent retrograde motion for objects beyond earths orbit is at its strongest he also took a third image as a control to eliminate any false results caused by defects in an individual plate tombaugh decided to image the entire zodiac rather than focus on those regions suggested by lowell

by the beginning of 1930 tombaughs search had reached the constellation of gemini on 18 february 1930 after searching for nearly a year and examining nearly 2 million stars tombaugh discovered a moving object on photographic plates taken on 23 january and 29 january of that year a lesser-quality photograph taken on january 21 confirmed the movement upon confirmation tombaugh walked into sliphers office and declared doctor slipher i have found your planet x the object lay just six degrees from one of two locations for planet x  lowell had suggested thus it seemed he had at last been vindicated after the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs news of the discovery was telegraphed to the harvard college observatory on march 13 1930 the new object was later precovered on photographs dating back to 19 march 1915 the decision to name the object pluto was intended in part to honour percival lowell as his initials made up the words first two letters after discovering pluto tombaugh continued to search the ecliptic for other distant objects he found hundreds of variable stars and asteroids as well as two comets but no further planets


 pluto loses planet x title 

to the observatorys disappointment and surprise pluto showed no visible disc it appeared as a point no different from a star and at only 15th magnitude was six times dimmer than lowell had predicted which meant it was either very small or very dark because lowell astronomers thought pluto was massive enough to perturb planets they assumed that its albedo could be no less than 0.07 meaning that it reflected only 7% of the light that hit it about as dark as asphalt and similar to that of mercury the least reflective planet known this would give pluto an estimated mass of no more than 70% that of earth observations also revealed that plutos orbit was very elliptical far more than that of any other planetalmost immediately some astronomers questioned plutos status as a planet barely a month after its discovery was announced on april 14 1930 in an article in the new york times armin o leuschner suggested that plutos dimness and high orbital eccentricity made it more similar to an asteroid or comet the lowell result confirms the possible high eccentricity announced by us on april 5 among the possibilities are a large asteroid greatly disturbed in its orbit by close approach to a major planet such as jupiter or it may be one of many long-period planetary objects yet to be discovered or a bright cometary object in that same article harvard observatory director harlow shapley wrote that pluto was a member of the solar system not comparable with known asteroids and comets and perhaps of greater importance to cosmogony than would be another major planet beyond neptune in 1931 using a mathematical formula ernest w brown asserted in agreement with e c bower that the presumed irregularities in the orbit of uranus could not be due to the gravitational effect of a more distant planet and thus that lowells supposed prediction was purely accidentalthroughout the mid-20th century estimates of plutos mass were revised downward in 1931 nicholson and mayall calculated its mass based on its supposed effect on the giant planets as roughly that of earth a value somewhat in accord with the 0.91 earth mass calculated in 1942 by lloyd r wylie at the us naval observatory using the same assumptions in 1949 gerard kuipers measurements of plutos diameter with the 200 inch telescope at mount palomar observatory led him to the conclusion that it was midway in size between mercury and mars and that its mass was most probably about 0.1 earth massin 1973 based on the similarities in the periodicity and amplitude of  brightness variation with triton dennis rawlins conjectured plutos mass must be similar to tritons in retrospect the conjecture turns out to have been correct it had been argued by astronomers walter baade and ec bower as early as 1934 however because tritons mass was then believed to be roughly 2.5% of the earth–moon system more than ten times its actual value rawlinss determination for plutos mass was similarly incorrect it was nonetheless a meagre enough value for him to conclude pluto was not planet x in 1976 dale cruikshank carl pilcher and david morrison of the university of hawaii analysed spectra from plutos surface and determined that it must contain methane ice which is highly reflective this meant that pluto far from being dark was in fact exceptionally bright and thus was probably no more than ​1⁄100 earth mass

plutos size was finally determined conclusively in 1978 when american astronomer james w christy discovered its moon charon this enabled him together with robert sutton harrington of the us naval observatory to measure the mass of the pluto–charon system directly by observing the moons orbital motion around pluto they determined plutos mass to be 1.31×1022 kg roughly one five-hundredth that of earth or one-sixth that of the moon and far too small to account for the observed discrepancies in the orbits of the outer planets lowells prediction had been a coincidence if there was a planet x it was not pluto


 further searches for planet x 
after 1978 a number of astronomers kept up the search for lowells planet x convinced that because pluto was no longer a viable candidate an unseen tenth planet must have been perturbing the outer planetsin the 1980s and 1990s robert harrington led a search to determine the real cause of the apparent irregularities he calculated that any planet x would be at roughly three times the distance of neptune from the sun its orbit would be highly eccentric and strongly inclined to the ecliptic—the planets orbit would be at roughly a 32-degree angle from the orbital plane of the other known planets this hypothesis was met with a mixed reception noted planet x sceptic brian g marsden of the minor planet center pointed out that these discrepancies were a hundredth the size of those noticed by le verrier and could easily be due to observational errorin 1972 joseph brady of the lawrence livermore national laboratory studied irregularities in the motion of halleys comet brady claimed that they could have been caused by a jupiter-sized planet beyond neptune at 59 au that is in a retrograde orbit around the sun however both marsden and planet x proponent p kenneth seidelmann attacked the hypothesis showing that halleys comet randomly and irregularly ejects jets of material causing changes to its own orbital trajectory and that such a massive object as bradys planet x would have severely affected the orbits of known outer planetsalthough its mission did not involve a search for planet x the iras space observatory made headlines briefly in 1983 due to an unknown object that was at first described as possibly as large as the giant planet jupiter and possibly so close to earth that it would be part of this solar system further analysis revealed that of several unidentified objects nine were distant galaxies and the tenth was interstellar cirrus none were found to be solar system bodiesin 1988 a a jackson and r m killen studied the stability of plutos resonance with neptune by placing test planet x-es with various masses and at various distances from pluto pluto and neptunes orbits  are in a 32 resonance which prevents their collision or even any close approaches regardless of their separation in the z axis it was found that the hypothetical objects mass had to exceed 5 earth masses to break the resonance and the parameter space is quite large and a large variety of objects could have existed beyond pluto without disturbing the resonance four test orbits of a trans-plutonian planet have been integrated forward for four million years in order to determine the effects of such a body on the stability of the neptune–pluto 32 resonance planets beyond pluto with masses of 0.1 and 1.0 earth masses in orbits at 48.3 and 75.5 au respectively do not disturb the 32 resonance test planets of 5 earth masses with semi-major axes of 52.5 and 62.5 au disrupt the four-million-year libration of plutos argument of perihelion


 planet x disproved 
harrington died in january 1993 without having found planet x six months before e myles standish had used data from voyager 2s 1989 flyby of neptune which had revised the planets total mass downward by 0.5—an amount comparable to the mass of mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on uranus when neptunes newly determined mass was used in the jet propulsion laboratory developmental ephemeris jpl de the supposed discrepancies in the uranian orbit and with them the need for a planet x vanished there are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as pioneer 10 pioneer 11 voyager 1 and voyager 2 that can be attributed to the gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in the outer solar system today most astronomers agree that planet x as lowell defined it does not exist


 discovery of further trans-neptunian objects 

after the discovery of pluto and charon no more trans-neptunian objects tnos were found until 15760 albion in 1992 since then thousands of such objects have been discovered most are now recognized as part of the kuiper belt a swarm of icy bodies left over from the solar systems formation that orbit near the ecliptic plane just beyond neptune though none were as large as pluto some of these distant trans-neptunian objects such as sedna were initially described in the media as new planetsin 2005 astronomer mike brown and his team announced the discovery of 2003 ub313 later named eris after the greek goddess of discord and strife a trans-neptunian object then thought to be just barely larger than pluto soon afterwards a nasa jet propulsion laboratory press release described the object as the tenth planeteris was never officially classified as a planet and the 2006 definition of planet defined both eris and pluto not as planets but as dwarf planets because they have not cleared their neighbourhoods they do not orbit the sun alone but as part of a population of similarly sized objects pluto itself is now recognized as being a member of the kuiper belt and the largest dwarf planet larger than the more-massive eris
a number of astronomers most notably alan stern the head of nasas new horizons mission to pluto contend that the iaus definition is flawed and that pluto and eris and all large trans-neptunian objects such as makemake sedna quaoar varuna and haumea should be considered planets in their own right however the discovery of eris did not rehabilitate the planet x theory because it is far too small to have significant effects on the outer planets orbits


 subsequently proposed trans-neptunian planets 
although most astronomers accept that lowells planet x does not exist a number have revived the idea that a large unseen planet could create observable gravitational effects in the outer solar system these hypothetical objects are often referred to as planet x although the conception of these objects may differ considerably from that proposed by lowell


 orbits of distant objects 


 sednas orbit 

when sedna was discovered its extreme orbit raised questions about its origin its perihelion is so distant approximately 75 au that no currently observed mechanism can explain sednas eccentric distant orbit it is too far from the planets to have been affected by the gravity of neptune or the other giant planets and too bound to the sun to be affected by outside forces such as the galactic tides hypotheses to explain its orbit include that it was affected by a passing star that it was captured from another planetary system or that it was tugged into its current position by a trans-neptunian planet the most obvious solution to determining sednas peculiar orbit would be to locate a number of objects in a similar region whose various orbital configurations would provide an indication as to their history if sedna had been pulled into its orbit by a trans-neptunian planet any other objects found in its region would have a similar perihelion to sedna around 80 au


 excitement of kuiper belt orbits 
in 2008 tadashi mukai and patryk sofia lykawka suggested a distant mars- or earth-sized planet currently in a highly eccentric orbit between 100 and 200 au and orbital period of 1000 years with an inclination of 20° to 40° was responsible for the structure of the kuiper belt they proposed that the perturbations of this planet excited the eccentricities and inclinations of the trans-neptunian objects truncated the planetesimal disk at 48 au and detached the orbits of objects like sedna from neptune during neptunes migration this planet is posited to have been captured in an outer resonance of neptune and to have evolved into a higher perihelion orbit due to the kozai mechanism leaving the remaining trans-neptunian objects on stable orbits


 elongated orbits of group of kuiper belt objects 
in 2012 rodney gomes modelled the orbits of 92 kuiper belt objects and found that six of those orbits were far more elongated than the model predicted he concluded that the simplest explanation was the gravitational pull of a distant planetary companion such as a neptune-sized object at 1,500 au this neptune-sized object would cause the perihelia of objects with semi-major axes greater than 300 au to oscillate delivering them into planet-crossing orbits like those of 308933 2006 sq372 and 87269 2000 oo67 or detached orbits like sednas


 discovery of 2012 vp113 and the orbital clustering of kuiper belt objects 
in 2014 astronomers announced the discovery of 2012 vp113 a large object with a sedna-like 4,200-year orbit and a perihelion of roughly 80 au which led them to suggest that it offered evidence of a potential trans-neptunian planet trujillo and sheppard argued that the orbital clustering of arguments of perihelia for vp113 and other extremely distant tnos suggests the existence of a super-earth of between 2 and 15 earth masses beyond 200 au and possibly on an inclined orbit at 1500 auin 2014 astronomers at the universidad complutense in madrid suggested that the available data actually indicate more than one trans-neptunian planet subsequent work further suggests that the evidence is robust enough


 further analysis and planet nine hypothesis 

on january 20 2016 brown and konstantin batygin published an article corroborating trujillo and sheppards initial findings proposing a super-earth dubbed planet nine based on a statistical clustering of the arguments of perihelia noted before near zero and also ascending nodes near 113° of six distant trans-neptunian objects they estimated it to be ten times the mass of earth about 60% the mass of neptune with a semimajor axis of approximately 400–1500 au


 probability 
even without gravitational evidence mike brown the discoverer of sedna has argued that sednas 12,000-year orbit means that probability alone suggests that an earth-sized object exists beyond neptune sednas orbit is so eccentric that it spends only a small fraction of its orbital period near the sun where it can be easily observed this means that unless its discovery was a freak accident there is probably a substantial population of objects roughly sednas diameter yet to be observed in its orbital region mike brown noted that sedna is about three-quarters the size of pluto if there are sixty objects three-quarters the size of pluto out there then there are probably forty objects the size of pluto  if there are forty objects the size of pluto then there are probably ten that are twice the size of pluto there are probably three or four that are three times the size of pluto and the biggest of these objects  is probably the size of mars or the size of the earth however he notes that should such an object be found even though it might approach earth in size it would still be a dwarf planet by the current definition because it would not have cleared its neighbourhood sufficiently


 kuiper cliff 
additionally speculation of a possible trans-neptunian planet has revolved around the so-called kuiper cliff the kuiper belt terminates suddenly at a distance of 48 au from the sun brunini and melita have speculated that this sudden drop-off may be attributed to the presence of an object with a mass between those of mars and earth located beyond 48 au the presence of an object with a mass similar to that of mars in a circular orbit at 60 au leads to a trans-neptunian object population incompatible with observations for instance it would severely deplete the plutino population astronomers have not excluded the possibility of an object with a mass similar to that of earth located farther than 100 au with an eccentric and inclined orbit computer simulations by patryk lykawka of kobe university have suggested that an object with a mass between 0.3 and 0.7 earth masses ejected outward by neptune early in the solar systems formation and currently in an elongated orbit between 101 and 200 au from the sun could explain the kuiper cliff and the peculiar detached objects such as sedna and 2012 vp113 although some astronomers such as renu malhotra and david jewitt have cautiously supported these claims others such as alessandro morbidelli have dismissed them as contrived in 2017 malhotra and kat volk argued that an unexpected variance in inclination for kbos farther than the cliff at 50 au provided evidence of a possible mars-sized planet residing at the edge of the solar system


 other proposed planets 
tyche was a hypothetical gas giant proposed to be located in the solar systems oort cloud it was first proposed in 1999 by astrophysicists john matese patrick whitman and daniel whitmire of the university of louisiana at lafayette they argued that evidence of tyches existence could be seen in a supposed bias in the points of origin for long-period comets in 2013 matese and whitmire re-evaluated the comet data and noted that tyche if it existed would be detectable in the archive of data that was collected by nasas wide-field infrared survey explorer wise telescope in 2014 nasa announced that the wise survey had ruled out any object with tyches characteristics indicating that tyche as hypothesized by matese whitman and whitmire does not existthe oligarch theory of planet formation states that there were hundreds of planet-sized objects known as oligarchs in the early stages of the solar systems evolution in 2005 astronomer eugene chiang speculated that although some of these oligarchs became the planets we know today most would have been flung outward by gravitational interactions some may have escaped the solar system altogether to become free-floating planets whereas others would be orbiting in a halo around the solar system with orbital periods of millions of years this halo would lie at between 1,000 and 10,000 au from the sun or between a third and a thirtieth the distance to the oort cloudin december 2015 astronomers at the atacama large millimeter array alma detected a brief series of 350 ghz pulses that they concluded must either be a series of independent sources or a single fast moving source deciding that the latter was the most likely they calculated based on its speed that were it bound to the sun the object which they named gna after a fast-moving messenger goddess in norse mythology would be about 12–25 au distant and have a dwarf planet-sized diameter of 220 to 880 km however if it were a rogue planet not gravitationally bound to the sun and as far away as 4000 au it could be much larger the paper was never formally accepted and has been withdrawn until the detection is confirmed scientists reactions to the notice were largely sceptical mike brown commented that if it is true that alma accidentally discovered a massive outer solar system object in its tiny tiny tiny field of view that would suggest that there are something like 200,000 earth-sized planets in the outer solar system  even better i just realized that this many earth-sized planets existing would destabilize the entire solar system and we would all die


 constraints on additional planets 
as of 2016 the following observations severely constrain the mass and distance of any possible additional solar system planet

an analysis of mid-infrared observations with the wise telescope have ruled out the possibility of a saturn-sized object 95 earth masses out to 10,000 au and a jupiter-sized or larger object out to 26,000 au wise has continued to take more data since then and nasa has invited the public to help search this data for evidence of planets beyond these limits via the backyard worlds planet 9 citizen science project
using modern data on the anomalous precession of the perihelia of saturn earth and mars lorenzo iorio concluded that any unknown planet with a mass of 0.7 times that of earth must be farther than 350–400 au one with a mass of 2 times that of earth farther than 496–570 au and finally one with a mass of 15 times that of earth farther than 970–1,111 au moreover iorio stated that the modern ephemerides of the solar system outer planets has provided even tighter constraints no celestial body with a mass of 15 times that of earth can exist closer than 1,100–1,300 au  however work by another group of astronomers using a more comprehensive model of the solar system found that iorios conclusion was only partially correct their analysis of cassini data on saturns orbital residuals found that observations were inconsistent with a planetary body with the orbit and mass similar to those of batygin and browns planet nine having a true anomaly of −130° to −110° or −65° to 85° furthermore the analysis found that saturns orbit is slightly better explained if such a body is located at a true anomaly of 117.8°11°−10° at this location it would be approximately 630 au from the sun
