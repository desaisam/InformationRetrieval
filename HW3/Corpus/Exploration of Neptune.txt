the exploration of neptune has only begun with one spacecraft voyager 2 in 1989 currently there are no approved future missions to visit the neptunian system nasa esa and also independent academic groups have proposed future scientific missions to visit neptune some mission plans are still active while others have been abandoned or put on hold
neptune has also been scientifically studied from afar with telescopes primarily since the mid 1990s this includes the hubble space telescope but most importantly ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics


 voyager 2 

after having visited saturn successfully it was decided to continue and fund further missions by voyager 2 to uranus and neptune these missions were conducted by the jet propulsion laboratory and the neptunian mission was dubbed voyager neptune interstellar mission voyager 2s observation phase of neptune began 5 june 1989 the spacecraft officially reached the neptunian system on 25 august and the data collection stopped on 2 october initially it was planned to use a trajectory that resulted in voyager 2 passing around 13,000 km 8,100 mi from neptune and 82,000 km 51,000 mi from triton the need to avoid ring material detected by stellar occultations resulted in this trajectory being abandoned and a trajectory that largely avoided the rings but resulted in more distant flybys of both targets

on 25 august in voyager 2s last planetary encounter the spacecraft swooped only 4,950 km 3,080 mi above neptunes north pole the closest approach it made to any body since it left earth in 1977 when the spacecraft visited the neptunian system neptune was the farthest known body in the solar system it was not until 1999 that pluto was further from the sun in its trajectory voyager 2 studied neptunes atmosphere neptunes rings its magnetosphere and neptunes moons the neptunian system had been studied scientifically for many years with telescopes and indirect methods but the close inspection by the voyager 2 probe settled many issues and revealed a plethora of information that could not have been obtained otherwise the data from voyager 2 are still the best data available on this planet in most cases
the exploration mission revealed that neptunes atmosphere is very dynamic even though it receives only 3% of the sunlight that jupiter receives winds on neptune were found to be the strongest in the solar system up to three times stronger than jupiters and nine times stronger than the strongest winds on earth most winds blew westward opposite the planets rotation separate cloud decks were discovered with cloud systems emerging and dissolving within hours and giant storms circling the entire planet in 16–18 hours in the upper layers voyager 2 discovered an anticyclone dubbed the great dark spot similar to jupiters great red spot however images taken by the hubble space telescope in 1994 revealed that the great dark spot had disappeared also seen in neptunes upper atmosphere at that time was an almond-shaped spot designated d2 and a bright quickly moving cloud high above the cloud decks dubbed scooter

the fly-by of the neptunian system provided the first accurate measurement of neptunes mass which was found to be 0.5 percent less than previously calculated the new figure disproved the hypothesis that an undiscovered planet x acted upon the orbits of neptune and uranusneptunes magnetosphere was also studied by voyager 2 the magnetic field was found to be highly tilted and largely offset from the planets centre the  probe discovered auroras but much weaker than those on earth or other planets the radio instruments on board found that neptunes day lasts 16 hours and 6.7 minutes neptunes rings had been observed from earth many years prior to voyager 2s visit but the close inspection revealed that the ring systems were full circle and intact and a total of four rings were countedvoyager 2 discovered six new small moons orbiting neptunes equatorial plane and they were named naiad thalassa despina galatea larissa and proteus only three of neptunes moons were photographed in detail proteus nereid and triton of which the last two were the only neptunian moons known prior to the visit proteus turned out to be an ellipsoid as large as gravity allows an ellipsoid body to become without rounding into a sphere it appeared very dark in color almost like soot nereid though discovered in 1949 still has very little known about it triton was revealed as having a remarkably active past active geysers and polar caps were discovered and a very thin atmosphere as well with thin clouds of what is thought to be nitrogen ice particles at just 38 k −235.2 °c it is the coldest known planetary body in the solar system the closest approach to triton was about 40,000 km 25,000 mi and it was the last solid world that voyager 2 explored close-by


 future missions 
currently there are no approved future missions to visit the neptunian system nasa esa and independent academic groups have proposed and worked on future scientific missions to visit neptune some mission plans are still active while others have been abandoned or put on hold
after the voyager flyby nasas next step in scientific exploration of the neptune system is considered to be a flagship orbiter mission such a hypothetical mission is envisioned to be possible in the late 2020s or early 2030s another one proposed for the 2040s is called the neptune-triton explorer nte nasa has researched several other project options for both flyby and orbiter missions of similar design as the cassini–huygens mission to saturn these missions are often collectively called rma neptune-triton-kbo missions which also includes orbital missions that would not visit kuiper belt objects kbos because of budgetary constraints technological considerations scientific priorities and other factors none of these have been approvedspecific exploration missions to neptune include

neptune orbiter mission — an orbiting mission concept focusing on neptune and triton
argo — a mission concept new frontiers flyby mission to visit jupiter saturn neptune with triton and the kuiper belt with launch in 2019
odinus —  a mission concept based on a twin spacecraft mission to investigate the neptunian and uranian systems launch date would be 2034
oss mission — a proposed collaborative flyby mission by esa and nasa its main focus would be to map the gravitational fields in deep space including the outer solar system up to 50 audirect flyby missions to neptune are only preferable in window gaps with a 12-year interval due to the complexity of planetary positions there is currently a window open for launching a neptune mission from 2014 to 2019 with the next opportunity occurring from 2031 these constraints are based on current rocket technology which relies on gravity assists from jupiter and saturn with the new space launch system sls technology in development at boeing deep space missions with heavier payloads could potentially be propelled at much greater speeds 200 au in 15 years and missions to the outer planets could be launched independently of gravity assistance


 scientific studies from afar 
space telescopes such as the hubble space telescope have signified a new era of detailed observations of faint objects from afar across the entire electromagnetic spectrum this includes faint objects in the solar system such as neptune since 1997 adaptive optics technology has also allowed for detailed scientific observations of neptune and its atmosphere from ground-based telescopes these image recordings now exceed the capability of hst by far and in some instances even the voyager images such as uranus ground-based observations are however always limited in their registration of electromagnetic waves of certain wavelengths due to the inevitable atmospheric absorption in particular of high energy waves
