mir russian мир ipa ˈmʲir lit peace or world was a soviet and later russian space station operational in low earth orbit from 1986 to 2001
with a mass greater than that of any previous space station mir was constructed from 1986 to 1996 with a modular design the first to be assembled in this way the station was the largest artificial satellite orbiting the earth until its deorbit on 21 march 2001 a record now surpassed by the international space station iss mir served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology human biology physics astronomy meteorology and spacecraft systems in order to develop technologies required for the permanent occupation of spacefollowing the success of the salyut programme mir represented the next stage in the soviet unions space station programme the first module of the station known as the core module or base block was launched in 1986 and was followed by six further modules kvant-1 1987 kvant-2 1989 kristall 1990 spektr 1995 the docking module 1995 and  priroda 1996 all launched by proton rockets with the exception of the docking module when complete the station consisted of seven pressurised modules and several unpressurised components power was provided by several solar arrays mounted directly on the modules the station was maintained at an orbit between 296 km 184 mi and 421 km 262 mi altitude and travelled at an average speed of 27,700 kmh 17,200 mph completing 15.7 earth orbits per dayspacewalks  extra-vehicular activities or evas in support of the operation of the station were major events in the assembly and maintenance of the orbital laboratory evas were performed to install new components onto the station to repair and replace various experiments systems and equipment and to install monitor and retrieve scientific experiments the first eva carried out at mir was held on 11 april 1987 when eo-2 crewmembers yury romanenko and aleksandr laveykin assisted in the docking of the kvant-1 module the longest eva was performed on 17 july 1990 when eo-6 crewmembers anatoly solovyev and aleksandr balandin left the station to repair their spacecraft soyuz tm-9 then encountered difficulties shutting the airlock hatch upon their return the total time for that spacewalk was seven hours and sixteen minutes close to the absolute limit of their orlan-dma spacesuitsin total eighty evas were conducted around mir from 1987 to 2000 sixty-three evas were conducted from kvant-2s airlock fifteen from the core modules docking node of which three were so-called intravehicular activities or ivas within spektr and two from the airlock of the space shuttle atlantis
 denotes evas performed from the core modules docking node denotes evas performed from the airlock of the space shuttle atlantisall other evas were performed from the airlock in kvant-2evas conducted during different principal expeditions eo russian экспедиция основная lit mission primary are separated by a wide blue line space shuttle missions sts are not separated from the expedition during which they took place
