the solar systems planets and officially recognized dwarf planets are known to be orbited by 194 natural satellites or moons 19 moons in the solar system are large enough to be gravitationally rounded and thus would be considered planets or dwarf planets if they were in direct orbit around the sun
moons are classed in two separate categories according to their orbits regular moons which have prograde orbits they orbit in the direction of their planets rotation and lie close to the plane of their equators and irregular moons whose orbits can be pro- or retrograde against the direction of their planets rotation and often lie at extreme angles to their planets equators irregular moons are probably minor planets that have been captured from surrounding space most irregular moons are less than 10 kilometres 6.2 mi in diameter
the earliest published discovery of a moon other than the earths was by galileo galilei who discovered the four galilean moons orbiting jupiter in 1610 over the following three centuries only a few more moons were discovered missions to other planets in the 1970s most notably the voyager 1 and 2 missions saw a surge in the number of moons detected and observations since the year 2000 using mostly large ground-based optical telescopes have discovered many more all of which are irregular recent years have had a drop in the number of discovered moons with only 14 moons – twelve of jupiter ten of which were announced at the same time one of makemake and one of neptune – being discovered since 2012


 moons by primary 

mercury the smallest and innermost planet has no moons or at least none that can be detected to a diameter of 1.6 km 1.0 mi for a very short time in 1974 mercury was thought to have a moon
venus also has no moons though reports of a moon around venus have circulated since the 17th century
earth has one moon the largest moon of any rocky planet in the solar system earth also has at least two co-orbitals the asteroids 3753 cruithne and 2002 aa29 however since they do not orbit earth they are not considered moons see other moons of earth and quasi-satellite
mars has two known moons phobos and deimos fear and dread after attendants of ares the greek god of war equivalent to the roman mars searches for more satellites have been unsuccessful putting the maximum radius of any other satellites at 90 m 100 ydjupiter has 79 moons with known orbits of which 72 have confirmed orbits and have thus received permanent designations of these 52 have been named its eight regular moons are grouped into the planet-sized galilean moons and the far smaller amalthea group they are named after lovers of zeus the greek equivalent of jupiter its 71 known irregular moons are organized into two categories prograde and retrograde the prograde satellites consist of the himalia group and three others in groups of one the retrograde moons are grouped into the carme ananke and pasiphae groups
saturn has 62 moons with known orbits 53 of them have names and these are the ones with confirmed orbits most of them are quite small seven moons are large enough to be in hydrostatic equilibrium including titan the second largest moon in the solar system including these large moons 24 of saturns moons are regular and traditionally named after titans or other figures associated with the mythological saturn the remaining 38 all small are irregular and classified by their orbital characteristics into inuit norse and gallic groups and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies the rings of saturn are made up of icy objects ranging in size from one centimetre to hundreds of metres each of which is on its own orbit about the planet thus a precise number of saturnian moons cannot be given as there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form saturns ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons at least 150 moonlets embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material though this is thought to be only a small sample of the total population of such objects
uranus has 27 named moons five of which are massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium there are another 13 inner moons that orbit within uranuss ring system and another nine outer irregular moons unlike most planetary moons which are named from antiquity all the moons of uranus are named after characters from the works of shakespeare and alexander popes work the rape of the lock
neptune has 14 moons the largest triton accounts for more than 99.5 percent of all the mass orbiting the planet triton is large enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium but uniquely for a large moon has a retrograde orbit suggesting it was a dwarf planet that was captured neptune also has seven known inner regular satellites and six outer irregular satellites
pluto a dwarf planet has five moons its largest moon charon named after the ferryman who took souls across the river styx is more than half as large as pluto itself and large enough to orbit a point outside plutos surface in effect each orbits the other forming a binary system informally referred to as a double-dwarf-planet plutos four  other moons nix hydra  kerberos and styx are  far smaller and orbit the pluto–charon systemamong the other dwarf planets ceres has no known moons it is 90 percent certain that ceres has no moons larger than 1 km in size assuming that they would have the same albedo as ceres itself haumea has two moons hiiaka and namaka of radii 195 and 100 km respectively makemake has one moon discovered in april 2016 a satellite having 1% makemakes brightness would have been detected if it had been located at an angular distance from makemake farther than 0.4 arcseconds 0.0001 degrees eris has one known moon dysnomia accurately determining its size is difficult one indicative estimate of its radius is 257±110 km but on some assumptions could be as high as 342±25 km the kuiper belt object 90482 orcus believed to be a dwarf planet was found in 2005 to have a natural satellite later named vanth
as of october 2009 190 asteroid moons and 63 trans-neptunian moons had been discovered


 list 
this is a list of the recognized moons of the planets and of the five recognised dwarf planets of the solar system the 19 moons that are large enough to have been rounded by their own gravity are listed in bold the seven largest moons which are larger than any of the known dwarf planets are listed in bold and italic sidereal period differs from semi-major axis because it depends on the mass of the primary as well as the satellites distance from it
