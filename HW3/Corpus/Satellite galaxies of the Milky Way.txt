the milky way has several smaller galaxies gravitationally bound to it as part of the milky way subgroup which is part of the local galaxy cluster the local groupthere are 59 small galaxies confirmed to be within 420 kiloparsecs 1.4 million light-years of the milky way but not all of them are necessarily in orbit and some may themselves be in orbit of other satellite galaxies the only ones visible to the naked eye are the large and small magellanic clouds which have been observed since prehistory measurements with the hubble space telescope in 2006 suggest the magellanic clouds may be moving too fast to be orbiting the milky way of the galaxies confirmed to be in orbit the largest is the sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy which has a diameter of 2.6 kiloparsecs 8,500 ly or roughly a twentieth that of the milky way


 characteristics 
satellite galaxies that orbit from 1,000 ly 310 pc of the edge of the disc of the milky way galaxy to the edge of the dark matter halo of the milky way at 980Ã—103 ly 300 kpc from the center of the galaxy are generally depleted in hydrogen gas compared to those that orbit more distantly this is because of their interactions with the dense hot gas halo of the milky way that strip cold gas from the satellites satellites beyond that region still retain copious quantities of gas


 list 
the milky ways satellite galaxies include the following

 streams 
the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy is currently in the process of being consumed by the milky way and is expected to pass through it within the next 100 million years the sagittarius stream is a stream of stars in polar orbit around the milky way leeched from the sagittarius dwarf the virgo stellar stream is a stream of stars that is believed to have once been an orbiting dwarf galaxy that has been completely distended by the milky ways gravity
