comet 322psoho also designated p1999 r1 p2003 r5 p2007 r5 and p2011 r4 is the first periodic comet to be discovered using the automated telescopes of the soho solar and heliospheric observatory spacecraft and second to be given a numbered designation after 321psoho jpl horizons next predicts 322p to come to perihelion closest approach to the sun at 2019-aug-31 1225 ut
the periodicity of p2007 r5 was predicted by sebastian f hönig a german graduate student and prolific asteroid discoverer in 2006 the announcement of the new periodic comet was made after the predicted return was confirmed by soho and observer b zhou on 10 september 2007 out of approximately 1,350 soho-observed sungrazer comets this is the first to be verified as a short-period comet most sungrazers are long-period comets on near-parabolic orbits that do not repeat for thousands of years if at all
as it passed to within 7.9 million kilometres of the sun around 05 au it brightened by a factor of around a million this is common behavior for a cometp2007 r5 is probably an extinct comet  extinct comets are those that have expelled most of their volatile ice and have little left to form a tail or coma they are theorized to be common objects amongst the celestial bodies orbiting close to the sun  p2007 r5 soho is probably only 100–200 meters in diameterit was expected to return in september 2011 and was recovered by b zhou on september 6 2011discovery credit goes to terry lovejoy australia 1999 kazimieras černis lithuania 2003 and bo zhou china 2007
the second periodic comet discovered by soho is p2003 t12 soho
