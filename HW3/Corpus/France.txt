 etymology 

originally applied to the whole frankish empire the name france comes from the latin francia or country of the franks modern france is still named today francia in italian and spanish frankreich frankish empire in german and frankrijk in dutch all of which have more or less the same historical meaning
there are various theories as to the origin of the name frank following the precedents of edward gibbon and jacob grimm the name of the franks has been linked with the word frank free in english it has been suggested that the meaning of free was adopted because after the conquest of gaul only franks were free of taxation another theory is that it is derived from the proto-germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the franks was known as a francisca however it has been determined that these weapons were named because of their use by the franks not the other way around


 history 


 prehistory before the 6th century bc 

the oldest traces of human life in what is now france date from approximately 1.8 million years ago humans were then confronted by a harsh and variable climate marked by several glacial eras
early hominids led a nomadic hunter-gatherer life france has a large number of decorated caves from the upper palaeolithic era including one of the most famous and best preserved lascaux approximately 18,000 bc
at the end of the last glacial period 10,000 bc the climate became milder from approximately 7,000 bc this part of western europe entered the neolithic era and its inhabitants became sedentary
after strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium initially working gold copper and bronze and later iron france has numerous megalithic sites from the neolithic period including the exceptionally dense carnac stones site approximately 3,300 bc


 antiquity 6th century bc–5th century ad 

in 600 bc ionian greeks originating from phocaea founded the colony of massalia present-day marseille on the shores of the mediterranean sea this makes it frances oldest city at the same time some gallic celtic tribes penetrated parts of the current territory of france and this occupation spread to the rest of france between the 5th and 3rd century bc

the concept of gaul emerged at that time it corresponds to the territories of celtic settlement ranging between the rhine the atlantic ocean the pyrenees and the mediterranean the borders of modern france are roughly the same as those of ancient gaul which was inhabited by celtic gauls gaul was then a prosperous country of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to greek and roman cultural and economic influences
around 390 bc the gallic chieftain brennus and his troops made their way to italy through the alps defeated the romans in the battle of the allia and besieged and ransomed rome the gallic invasion left rome weakened and the gauls continued to harass the region until 345 bc when they entered into a formal peace treaty with rome but the romans and the gauls would remain adversaries for the next centuries and the gauls would continue to be a threat in italyaround 125 bc the south of gaul was conquered by the romans who called this region provincia nostra our province which over time evolved into the name provence in french julius caesar conquered the remainder of gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the gallic chieftain vercingetorix in 52 bc according to plutarch and the writings of scholar brendan woods the gallic wars resulted in 800 conquered cities 300 subdued tribes one million men sold into slavery and another three million dead in battlegaul was divided by augustus into roman provinces many cities were founded during the gallo-roman period including lugdunum present-day lyon which is considered the capital of the gauls these cities were built in traditional roman style with a forum a theatre a circus an amphitheatre and thermal baths the gauls mixed with roman settlers and eventually adopted roman culture and roman speech latin from which the french language evolved the roman polytheism merged with the gallic paganism into the same syncretism
from the 250s to the 280s ad roman gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians nevertheless the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century which was a period of revival and prosperity for roman gaul in 312 emperor constantin i converted to christianity subsequently christians who had been persecuted until then increased rapidly across the entire roman empire but from the beginning of the 5th century the barbarian invasions resumed teutonic tribes invaded the region from present-day germany the visigoths settling in the southwest the burgundians along the rhine river valley and the franks from whom the french take their name in the north


 early middle ages 5th century–10th century 

at the end of the antiquity period ancient gaul was divided into several germanic kingdoms and a remaining gallo-roman territory known as the kingdom of syagrius simultaneously celtic britons fleeing the anglo-saxon settlement of britain settled the western part of armorica as a result the armorican peninsula was renamed brittany celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region
the first leader to make himself king of all the franks was clovis i who began his reign in 481 routing the last forces of the roman governors of the province in 486 clovis claimed that he would be baptized a christian in the event of his victory against the visigoths which was said to have guaranteed the battle clovis regained the southwest from the visigoths was baptized in 508 and made himself master of what is now western germany
clovis i was the first germanic conqueror after the fall of the roman empire to convert to catholic christianity rather than arianism thus france was given the title eldest daughter of the church french la fille aînée de léglise by the papacy and french kings would be called the most christian kings of france rex christianissimus

the franks embraced the christian gallo-roman culture and ancient gaul was eventually renamed francia land of the franks the germanic franks adopted romanic languages except in northern gaul where roman settlements were less dense and where germanic languages emerged clovis made paris his capital and established the merovingian dynasty but his kingdom would not survive his death the franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs so four kingdoms emerged from cloviss paris orléans soissons and rheims the last merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace head of household one mayor of the palace charles martel defeated an islamic invasion of gaul at the battle of tours 732 and earned respect and power within the frankish kingdoms his son pepin the short seized the crown of francia from the weakened merovingians and founded the carolingian dynasty pepins son charlemagne reunited the frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across western and central europe
proclaimed holy roman emperor by pope leo iii and thus establishing in earnest the french governments longtime historical association with the catholic church charlemagne tried to revive the western roman empire and its cultural grandeur charlemagnes son louis i emperor 814–840 kept the empire united however this carolingian empire would not survive his death in 843 under the treaty of verdun the empire was divided between louis three sons with east francia going to louis the german middle francia to lothair i and west francia to charles the bald west francia approximated the area occupied by and was the precursor to modern franceduring the 9th and 10th centuries continually threatened by viking invasions france became a very decentralised state the nobilitys titles and lands became hereditary and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen thus was established feudalism in france over time some of the kings vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king for example after the battle of hastings in 1066 william the conqueror added king of england to his titles becoming both the vassal to as duke of normandy and the equal of as king of england the king of france creating recurring tensions


 late middle ages 10th century–15th century 

the carolingian dynasty ruled france until 987 when hugh capet duke of france and count of paris was crowned king of the franks his descendants—the capetians the house of valois and the house of bourbon—progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance into the kingdom of france which was fully declared in 1190 by philip ii augustus the french nobility played a prominent role in most crusades in order to restore christian access to the holy land french knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the two-hundred-year span of the crusades in such a fashion that the arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as franj caring little whether they really came from france the french crusaders also imported the french language into the levant making french the base of the lingua franca litt frankish language of the crusader states french knights also made up the majority in both the hospital and the temple orders the latter in particular held numerous properties throughout france and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the french crown until philip iv annihilated the order in 1307 the albigensian crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical cathars in the southwestern area of modern-day france in the end the cathars were exterminated and the autonomous county of toulouse was annexed into the crown lands of france later kings expanded their domain to cover over half of modern continental france including most of the north centre and west of france meanwhile the royal authority became more and more assertive centred on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility clergy and commoners
from the 11th century the house of plantagenet the rulers of the county of anjou succeeded in establishing its dominion over the surrounding provinces of maine and touraine then progressively built an empire that spanned from england to the pyrenees and covering half of modern france tensions between the kingdom of france and the plantagenet empire would last a hundred years until philip augustus of france conquered between 1202 and 1214 most of the continental possessions of the empire leaving england and aquitaine to the plantagenets following the battle of bouvines the angevin court retreated to england but persistent capetian–plantagenet rivalry would paved the way for another conflict
charles iv the fair died without an heir in 1328 under the rules of the salic law the crown of france could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line accordingly the crown passed to philip of valois a cousin of charles rather than through the female line to charles nephew edward of plantagenet who would soon become edward iii of england during the reign of philip of valois the french monarchy reached the height of its medieval power philips seat on the throne was contested by edward iii of england and in 1337 on the eve of the first wave of the black death england and france went to war in what would become known as the hundred years war the exact boundaries changed greatly with time but french landholdings of the english kings remained extensive for decades with charismatic leaders such as joan of arc and la hire strong french counterattacks won back english continental territories like the rest of europe france was struck by the black death half of the 17 million population of france died


 early modern period 15th century–1789 
main articles french renaissance c 1400–c 1650 early modern france 1500–1789 french wars of religion 1562–1598 and ancien régime c 1400–1792
the french renaissance saw a spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the french language which would become the official language of france and the language of europes aristocracy it also saw a long set of wars known as the italian wars between france and the house of habsburg french explorers such as jacques cartier or samuel de champlain claimed lands in the americas for france paving the way for the expansion of the first french colonial empire the rise of protestantism in europe led france to a civil war known as the french wars of religion where in the most notorious incident thousands of huguenots were murdered in the st bartholomews day massacre of 1572 the wars of religion were ended by henry ivs edict of nantes which granted some freedom of religion to the huguenots spanish troops the terror of western europe assisted the catholic side during the wars of religion in 1589–1594 and invaded northern france in 1597 after some skirmishing in the 1620s and 1630s spain and france returned to all-out war between 1635 and 1659 the war cost france 300,000 casualtiesunder louis xiii the energetic cardinal richelieu promoted the centralisation of the state and reinforced the royal power by disarming domestic power holders in the 1620s he systematically destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private violence dueling carrying weapons and maintaining private army by the end of 1620s richelieu established the royal monopoly of force as the doctrine during louis xivs minority and the regency of queen anne and cardinal mazarin a period of trouble known as the fronde occurred in france this rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal absolute power in france

the monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of louis xiv by turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the palace of versailles louis xivs personal power became unchallenged remembered for his numerous wars he made france the leading european power france became the most populous country in europe and had tremendous influence over european politics economy and culture french became the most-used language in diplomacy science literature and international affairs and remained so until the 20th century france obtained many overseas possessions in the americas africa and asia louis xiv also revoked the edict of nantes forcing thousands of huguenots into exile
under louis xv louis xivs great-grandson france lost new france and most of its indian possessions after its defeat in the seven years war 1756–63 its european territory kept growing however with notable acquisitions such as lorraine 1766 and corsica 1770 an unpopular king louis xvs weak rule his ill-advised financial political and military decisions – as well as the debauchery of his court– discredited the monarchy which arguably paved the way for the french revolution 15 years after his deathlouis xvi louis xvs grandson actively supported the americans who were seeking their independence from great britain realised in the treaty of paris 1783 the financial crisis aggravated by frances involvement in the american revolutionary war was one of many contributing factors to the french revolution much of the enlightenment occurred in french intellectual circles and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions such as the discovery of oxygen 1778 and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers 1783 were achieved by french scientists french explorers such as bougainville and lapérouse took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe the enlightenment philosophy in which reason is advocated as the primary source for legitimacy and authority undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and helped pave the way for the french revolution


 revolutionary france 1789–1799 

facing financial troubles king louis xvi summoned the estates-general gathering the three estates of the realm in may 1789 to propose solutions to his government as it came to an impasse the representatives of the third estate formed into a national assembly signalling the outbreak of the french revolution fearing that the king would suppress the newly created national assembly insurgents stormed the bastille on 14 july 1789 a date which would become frances national day
in early august 1789 the national constituent assembly abolished the privileges of the nobility such as personal serfdom and exclusive hunting rights
through the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen 27 august 1789 france established fundamental rights for men the declaration affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of man to liberty property security and resistance to oppression freedom of speech and press were declared and arbitrary arrests outlawed it called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth
in november 1789 the assembly decided to nationalize and sell all property of the roman catholic church which had been the largest landowner in the country in july 1790 a civil constitution of the clergy reorganised the french catholic church cancelling the authority of the church to levy taxes et cetera this fueled much discontent in parts of france which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later while king louis xvi still enjoyed popularity among the population his disastrous flight to varennes june 1791 seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion his credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility
in august 1791 the emperor of austria and the king of prussia in the declaration of pillnitz threatened revolutionary france to intervene by force of arms to restore the french absolute monarchy in september 1791 the national constituent assembly forced king louis xvi to accept the french constitution of 1791 thus turning the french absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy in the newly established legislative assembly october 1791 enmity developed and deepened between a group later called the girondins who favored war with austria and prussia and a group later called montagnards or jacobins who opposed such a war a majority in the assembly in 1792 however saw a war with austria and prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government and thought that france would win a war against those gathered monarchies on 20 april 1792 therefore they declared war on austria

on 10 august 1792 an angry crowd threatened the palace of king louis xvi who took refuge in the legislative assembly
a prussian army invaded france later in august 1792
in early september parisians infuriated by the prussian army capturing verdun and counter-revolutionary uprisings in the west of france murdered between 1,000 and 1,500 prisoners by raiding the parisian prisons the assembly and the paris city council seemed unable to stop that bloodshed the national convention chosen in the first elections under male universal suffrage on 20 september 1792 succeeded the legislative assembly and on 21 september abolished the monarchy by proclaiming the french first republic
ex-king louis xvi was convicted of treason and guillotined in january 1793
france had declared war on great britain and the dutch republic in november 1792 and did the same on spain in march 1793 in the spring of 1793 austria and prussia invaded france in march france created a sister republic in the republic of mainz
also in march 1793 the civil war of the vendée against paris started evoked by both the civil constitution of the clergy of 1790 and the nationwide army conscription early 1793 elsewhere in france rebellion was brewing too
a factionalist feud in the national convention smoldering ever since october 1791 came to a climax with the group of the girondins on 2 june 1793 being forced to resign and leave the convention
the counter-revolution begun in march 1793 in the vendée by july had spread to brittany normandy bordeaux marseilles toulon and lyon paris convention government between october and december 1793 with brutal measures managed to subdue most internal uprisings at the cost of tens of thousands of lives some historians consider the civil war to have lasted until 1796 with a toll of possibly 450,000 lives
france in february 1794 abolished slavery in its american colonies but would reintroduce it later
political disagreements and enmity in the national convention between october 1793 and july 1794 reached unprecedented levels leading to dozens of convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined
meanwhile frances external wars in 1794 were going prosperous for example in belgium
in 1795 the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of catholic religion and fair distribution of food
until 1799 politicians apart from inventing a new parliamentary system the directory busied themselves with dissuading the people from catholicism and from royalism


 napoleon and 19th century 1799–1914 

napoleon bonaparte seized control of the republic in 1799 becoming first consul and later emperor of the french empire 1804–1814 1815 as a continuation of the wars sparked by the european monarchies against the french republic changing sets of european coalitions declared wars on napoleons empire his armies conquered most of continental europe with swift victories such as the battles of jena-auerstadt or austerlitz members of the bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms these victories led to the worldwide expansion of french revolutionary ideals and reforms such as the metric system the napoleonic code and the declaration of the rights of man after the catastrophic russian campaign and the ensuing uprising of european monarchies against his rule napoleon was defeated and the bourbon monarchy restored about a million frenchmen died during the napoleonic wars after his brief return from exile napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the battle of waterloo the monarchy was re-established 1815–1830 with new constitutional limitations
the discredited bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the july revolution of 1830 which established the constitutional july monarchy in that year french troops conquered algeria establishing the first colonial presence in africa since napoleons abortive invasion of egypt in 1798 according to historian ben kiernan the french conquest and pacification of algeria from 1830 until the early twentieth century slaughtered 825,000 algerian people french losses from 1831–51 were 92,329 dead in the hospital and only 3,336 killed in actionin 1848 general unrest led to the february revolution and the end of the july monarchy the abolition of slavery and male universal suffrage both briefly enacted during the french revolution were re-enacted in 1848 in 1852 the president of the french republic louis-napoléon bonaparte napoleon is nephew was proclaimed emperor of the second empire as napoleon iii he multiplied french interventions abroad especially in crimea in mexico and italy which resulted in the annexation of the duchy of savoy and the county of nice then part of the kingdom of sardinia napoleon iii was unseated following defeat in the franco-prussian war of 1870 and his regime was replaced by the third republic

france had colonial possessions in various forms since the beginning of the 17th century but in the 19th and 20th centuries its global overseas colonial empire extended greatly and became the second largest in the world behind the british empire including metropolitan france the total area of land under french sovereignty almost reached 13 million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s 8.6% of the worlds land known as the belle époque the turn of the century was a period characterised by optimism regional peace economic prosperity and technological scientific and cultural innovations in 1905 state secularism was officially established
the french conquest of morocco was one of the longest and toughest in the annals of european colonialism french historian daniel rivet puts the casualty rate among moroccans who resisted the french occupation at 100,000


 contemporary period 1914–present 

france was a member of the triple entente when world war i broke out a small part of northern france was occupied but france and its allies emerged victorious against the central powers at a tremendous human and material cost world war i left 1.4 million french soldiers dead 4% of its population between 27 and 30% of soldiers conscripted from 1912–1915 were killed the interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the popular front government annual leave eight-hour workdays women in government
in 1940 france was invaded and occupied by nazi germany and italy metropolitan france was divided into a german occupation zone in the north an italian occupation zone in the south-east and vichy france a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with germany in the south while free france the government-in-exile led by charles de gaulle was set up in london from 1942 to 1944 about 160,000 french citizens including around 75,000 jews were deported to death camps and concentration camps in germany and occupied poland in september 1943 corsica was the first french continental territory to liberate itself from the axis on 6 june 1944 the allies invaded normandy and in august they invaded provence over the following year the allies and the french resistance emerged victorious over the axis powers and french sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the provisional government of the french republic gprf this interim government established by de gaulle aimed to continue to wage war against germany and to purge collaborators from office it also made several important reforms suffrage extended to women creation of a social security system the gprf laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the fourth republic which saw spectacular economic growth les trente glorieuses france was one of the founding members of nato 1949

on 8 may 1945 while liberation was celebrated in france peaceful demonstrations in sétif in eastern algeria were violently repressed more than 40,000 algerian fell victim to the shooting and strafing from planes and armed cars at the end of the same month the french bombarded damascus killing hundreds the bombardment of haiphong on 23 november 1946 killed about 6,000 between march 1947 and september 1948 the electoral victory of the proponents of independence in madagascar was followed by a savage repression by the french army 18,000 mostly senegalese troops resulting in some 90,000 deaths some 200 peaceful civilians demonstrating for independence were killed by mostly senegalese french troops in casablanca morocco on april 7–8 1947 in cameroon a radical nationalist movement for independence the union des populations du cameroun upc was forced underground and engaged in guerrilla warfare against the french administration the ensuing repression of the french army and paramilitary forces gendarmerie took the form during 1958–1960 of a scorched-earth policy whereby entire villages of south-central and western cameroon in the bassa and bamiléké areas were burned to the ground resulting in between 60,000 and 100,000 deaths france attempted to regain control of french indochina but was defeated by the viet minh in 1954 at the climactic battle of dien bien phu estimates of the number of vietnamese military and civilian casualties during the war of independence from france range from 300,000 dead and 300,000 wounded to half a million dead and 1 million woundedonly months later france faced another anti-colonialist conflict in algeria torture and illegal executions were perpetrated by both sides and the debate over whether or not to keep control of algeria then home to over one million european settlers wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war in 1958 the weak and unstable fourth republic gave way to the fifth republic which included a strengthened presidency in the latter role charles de gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the algerian war despite its military victory france granted independence to algerians the war exacted a heavy human toll among the algerian population it resulted in some 500,000 deaths and 2,137,000 internally displaced algerians a vestige of the colonial empire are the french overseas departments and territories
in the context of the cold war de gaulle pursued a policy of national independence towards the western and eastern blocs to this end he withdrew from natos military integrated command he launched a nuclear development programme and made france the fourth nuclear power he restored cordial franco-german relations in order to create a european counterweight between the american and soviet spheres of influence however he opposed any development of a supranational europe favouring a europe of sovereign nations in the wake of the series of worldwide protests of 1968 the revolt of may 1968 had an enormous social impact in france it is considered to be the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal religion patriotism respect for authority shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal secularism individualism sexual revolution although the revolt was a political failure as the gaullist party emerged even stronger than before it announced a split between the french people and de gaulle who resigned shortly after
in the post-gaullist era france remained one of the most developed economies in the world but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt in the late 20th and early 21st centuries france has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational european union notably by signing the maastricht treaty which created the european union in 1992 establishing the eurozone in 1999 and signing the lisbon treaty in 2007 france has also gradually but fully reintegrated into nato and has since participated in most nato sponsored wars

since the 19th century france has received many immigrants these have been mostly male foreign workers from european catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed during the 1970s france faced economic crisis and allowed new immigrants mostly from the maghreb to permanently settle in france with their families and to acquire french citizenship it resulted in hundreds of thousands of muslims especially in the larger cities living in subsidised public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates simultaneously france renounced the assimilation of immigrants where they were expected to adhere to french traditional values and cultural norms they were encouraged to retain their distinctive cultures and traditions and required merely to integratesince the 1995 paris métro and rer bombings france has been sporadically targeted by islamist organisations notably the charlie hebdo attack in january 2015 which provoked the largest public rallies in french history gathering 4.4 million people the november 2015 paris attacks which resulted in 130 deaths the deadliest attack on french soil since world war ii and the deadliest in the european union since the madrid train bombings in 2004 and the 2016 nice attack which caused 87 deaths during bastille day celebrations

metropolitan france has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes large parts of the current territory of france were raised during several tectonic episodes like the hercynian uplift in the paleozoic era during which the armorican massif the massif central the morvan the vosges and ardennes ranges and the island of corsica were formed these massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the aquitaine basin in the southwest and the paris basin in the north the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of beauce and brie various routes of natural passage such as the rhône valley allow easy communications the alpine pyrenean and jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms at 4,810.45 metres 15,782 ft above sea level mont blanc located in the alps on the french and italian border is the highest point in western europe
although 60% of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks these risks remain moderate the coastlines offer contrasting landscapes mountain ranges along the french riviera coastal cliffs such as the côte dalbâtre and wide sandy plains in the languedoc corsica lies off the mediterranean coast france has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers seine the loire the garonne the rhône and their tributaries whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory the rhône divides the massif central from the alps and flows into the mediterranean sea at the camargue other water courses drain towards the meuse and rhine along the north-eastern borders france has 11 million square kilometres 4.2×106 sq mi of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction of which 97% are overseas


 climate 
most of the low-lying areas of metropolitan france are located in the oceanic climate zone cfb and cfc in the köppen classification corsica and a small part of the territory bordering the mediterranean basin lies in the csa and csb zones as the french metropolitan territory is relatively large the climate is not uniform giving rise to the following climate nuances

the west of france has strictly oceanic climate cfb – it extends from flanders to the basque country in a coastal strip several tens of kilometres wide narrower to the north and south but wider in brittany which is almost entirely in this climate zone
the climate of the southwest is also oceanic but warmer
the climate of the northwest is oceanic but cooler and windier
away from the coast the climate is oceanic throughout but its characteristics change somewhat the paris sedimentary basin and more so the basins protected by mountain chains show a stronger seasonal temperature variability and less rainfall during autumn and winter therefore most of the territory has a semi-oceanic climate and forms a transition zone between strictly oceanic climate near the coasts and other climate zones
the semi-continental climate dfa of the north and centre-east alsace plains of the saône the middle part of the rhône dauphiné auvergne and savoy
the mediterranean and the lower rhône valley experience a mediterranean climate csa and csb due to the effect of mountain chains isolating them from the rest of the country and the resulting mistral and tramontane winds
the mountain or alpine climates dfc and et are confined to the alps the pyrenees and the summits of the massif central the jura and the vosges
in the overseas regions there are three broad types of climate
a tropical climate am in most overseas regions including eastern french guiana high constant temperature throughout the year with a dry and a wet season
an equatorial climate af in western french guiana high constant temperature with even precipitation throughout the year
a subpolar climate et in saint pierre and miquelon and in most of the french southern and antarctic lands short mild summers and long very cold winters


 environment 

france was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry in 1971 although it is one of the most industrialised countries in the world france is ranked only 17th by carbon dioxide emissions behind less populous nations such as canada or australia this is because france decided to invest in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis which now accounts for 75% of its electricity production and results in less pollution according to the 2016 environmental performance index conducted by yale and columbia france was the tenth-most environmentally-conscious country in the world

like all european union state members france agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by the year 2020 compared to the united states plan to reduce emissions by 4% of 1990 levels as of  2009 french carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of chinas the country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 at 17 euros per tonne of carbon emitted which would have raised 4 billion euros of revenue annually however the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening french businesses

forests account for 28% of frances land area and are some of the most diverse in europe comprising more than 140 species of trees there are nine national parks and 46 natural parks in france with the government planning to convert 20% of its exclusive economic zone into a marine protected area by 2020 a regional nature park french parc naturel régional or pnr is a public establishment in france between local authorities and the french national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty in order to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area a pnr sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation sustainable economic development and protection of the natural environment based on each parks unique landscape and heritage the parks foster ecological research programmes and public education in the natural sciences as of  2014 there are 49 pnrs in france


 administrative divisions 

the french republic is divided into 18 regions located in europe and overseas five overseas collectivities one overseas territory one special collectivity – new caledonia and one uninhabited island directly under the authority of the minister of overseas france – clipperton

regions
since 2016 france is mainly divided into 18 administrative regions 13 regions in metropolitan france including the territorial collectivity of corsica and five located overseas the regions are further subdivided into 101 departments which are numbered mainly alphabetically this number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle number plates among the 101 departments of france five french guiana guadeloupe martinique mayotte and réunion are in overseas regions roms that are also simultaneously overseas departments doms enjoy exactly the same status as metropolitan departments and are an integral part of the european union
the 101 departments are subdivided into 335 arrondissements which are in turn subdivided into 2,054 cantons these cantons are then divided into 36,658 communes which are municipalities with an elected municipal council three communes—paris lyon and marseille—are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements
the regions departments and communes are all known as territorial collectivities meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions however this was not always the case until 1940 the arrondissements were territorial collectivities with an elected assembly but these were suspended by the vichy regime and definitely abolished by the fourth republic in 1946

overseas territories and collectivitiesin addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments the french republic has five overseas collectivities french polynesia saint barthélemy saint martin saint pierre and miquelon and wallis and futuna one sui generis collectivity new caledonia one overseas territory french southern and antarctic lands and one island possession in the pacific ocean clipperton island
overseas collectivities and territories form part of the french republic but do not form part of the european union or its fiscal area with the exception of st bartelemy which seceded from guadeloupe in 2007 the pacific collectivities coms of french polynesia wallis and futuna and new caledonia continue to use the cfp franc whose value is strictly linked to that of the euro in contrast the five overseas regions used the french franc and now use the euro


 politics 


 government 
the french republic is a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic with strong democratic traditions the constitution of the fifth republic was approved by referendum on 28 september 1958 it greatly strengthened the authority of the executive in relation to parliament the executive branch itself has two leaders the president of the republic currently emmanuel macron who is head of state and is elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a 5-year term formerly 7 years and the government led by the president-appointed prime minister

 law 

france uses a civil legal system that is law arises primarily from written statutes judges are not to make law but merely to interpret it though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the napoleonic code which was in turn largely based on the royal law codified under louis xiv in agreement with the principles of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society as guy canivet first president of the court of cassation wrote about the management of prisons freedom is the rule and its restriction is the exception any restriction of freedom must be provided for by law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality that is law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy

french law is divided into two principal areas private law and public law private law includes in particular civil law and criminal law public law includes in particular administrative law and constitutional law however in practical terms french law comprises three principal areas of law civil law criminal law and administrative law criminal laws can only address the future and not the past criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited while administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries it is completely separated in france and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court ordinary courts which handle criminal and civil litigation are headed by the court of cassation and administrative courts are headed by the council of state

freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen the 1905 french law on the separation of the churches and the state is the basis for laïcité state secularism the state does not formally recognize any religion except in alsace-moselle nonetheless it does recognize religious associations the parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995 and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004 in 2010 it banned the wearing of face-covering islamic veils in public human rights groups such as amnesty international and human rights watch described the law as discriminatory towards muslims however it is supported by most of the population

most french people are of celtic gauls origin with an admixture of italic romans and germanic franks groups different regions reflect this diverse heritage with notable breton elements in western france aquitanian in the southwest scandinavian in the northwest alemannic in the northeast and ligurian influence in the southeast large-scale immigration over the last century and a half has led to a more multicultural society in 2004 the institut montaigne estimated that within metropolitan france 51 million people were white 85% of the population 6 million were northwest african 10 2 million were black 3.3 and 1 million were asian 1.7a law originating from the 1789 revolution and reaffirmed in the 1958 french constitution makes it illegal for the french state to collect data on ethnicity and ancestry in 2008 the teo trajectories and origins poll conducted jointly by ined and the french national institute of statistics estimated that 5 million people were of italian ancestry the largest immigrant community followed by 3 million to 6 million people of northwest african ancestry 2.5 million people of sub-saharan african origin and 200,000 people of turkish ancestry there are over 500,000 ethnic armenians in france there are also sizeable minorities of other european ethnic groups namely spanish portuguese polish and greekfrance has a significant gypsy gitan population numbering between 20,000 and 400,000 many foreign romani people are expelled back to bulgaria and romania frequentlyit is currently estimated that 40% of the french population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration the country has received since the early 20th century between 1921 and 1935 alone about 1.1 million net immigrants came to france the next largest wave came in the 1960s when around 1.6 million pieds noirs returned to france following the independence of its northwest african possessions algeria and morocco they were joined by numerous former colonial subjects from north and west africa as well as numerous european immigrants from spain and portugal
france remains a major destination for immigrants accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually it is also western europes leading recipient of asylum seekers with an estimated 50,000 applications in 2005 a 15% decrease from 2004 the european union allows free movement between the member states although france established controls to curb eastern european migration and immigration remains a contentious political issue
in 2008 the insee estimated that the total number of foreign-born immigrants was around 5 million 8% of the population while their french-born descendants numbered 6.5 million or 11% of the population thus nearly a fifth of the countrys population were either first or second-generation immigrants of which more than 5 million were of european origin and 4 million of maghrebi ancestry in 2008 france granted citizenship to 137,000 persons mostly to people from morocco algeria and turkeyin 2014 the national institute of statistics insee for its acronym in french published a study which reported doubling of the number of spanish immigrants portuguese and italians in france between 2009 and 2012
according to the french institute this increase resulting from the financial crisis that hit several european countries in that period has pushed up the number of europeans installed in france
statistics on spanish immigrants in france show a growth of 107 percent between 2009 and 2012 ie in this period went from 5300 to 11,000 people
of the total of 229,000 foreigners who were in france in 2012 nearly 8% were portuguese 5% british 5% spanish 4% italians 4% germans 3% romanians and 3% belgians


 major cities

 language 

according to article 2 of the constitution the official language of france is french a romance language derived from latin since 1635 the académie française has been frances official authority on the french language although its recommendations carry no legal weight there are also regional languages spoken in france such as occitan breton catalan flemish dutch dialect alsatian german dialect basque and others see languages of france italian was the official language of corsica until may 9 1859the french government does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals but the use of french is required by law in commercial and workplace communications in addition to mandating the use of french in the territory of the republic the french government tries to promote french in the european union and globally through institutions such as la francophonie the perceived threat from anglicisation has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the french language in france besides french there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of france eight spoken in french metropolitan territory and 69 in the french overseas territories
from the 17th to the mid-20th century french served as the pre-eminent international language of diplomacy and international affairs as well as a lingua franca among the educated classes of europe the dominant position of french language in international affairs was overtaken by english since the emergence of the us as a major powerfor most of the time in which french served as an international lingua franca it was not the native language of most frenchmen a report in 1794 conducted by henri grégoire found that of the countrys 25 million people only three million spoke french natively the rest spoke one of the countrys many regional languages such as alsatian breton or occitan through the expansion of public education in which french was the sole language of instruction as well as other factors such as increased urbanisation and the rise of mass communication french gradually came to be adopted by virtually the entire population a process not completed until the 20th century
as a result of frances extensive colonial ambitions between the 17th and 20th centuries french was introduced to the americas africa polynesia south-east asia and the caribbean french is the second most studied foreign language in the world after english and is a lingua franca in some regions notably in africa the legacy of french as a living language outside europe is mixed it is nearly extinct in some former french colonies the levant south and southeast asia while creoles and pidgins based on french have emerged in the french departments in the west indies and the south pacific french polynesia on the other hand many former french colonies have adopted french as an official language and the total number of french speakers is increasing especially in africa

 religion 

france is a secular country and freedom of religion is a constitutional right french religious policy is based on the concept of laïcité a strict separation of church and state under which public life is kept completely secular
according to a survey held in 2016 by institut montaigne and institut français dopinion publique ifop 51.1% of the total population of france was christian as of that year at the same time 39.6% of the population had no religion atheism or agnosticism 5.6% were muslims 2.5% were followers of other faiths and the remaining 0.4% were undecided about their faith estimates of the number of muslims in france vary widely in 2003 the french ministry of the interior estimated the total number of people of muslim background to be between 5 and 6 million 8–10 the current jewish community in france as of  2016 about 0.8% of the population are religious jews is the largest in europe and the third-largest in the world after those in israel and the united states

catholicism has been the predominant religion in france for more than a millennium though it is not as actively practised today as it was among the 47,000 religious buildings in france 94% are roman catholic during the french revolution activists conducted a brutal campaign of de-christianisation ending the catholic church as the state religion in some cases clergy and churches were attacked with iconoclasm stripping the churches of statues and ornament after the back and forth of catholic royal and secular republican governments during the 19th century france established laïcité by passage of the 1905 law on the separation of the churches and the statesince 1905 the french government has followed the principle of laïcité in which it is prohibited from recognising any specific right to a religious community except for legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the local law in alsace-moselle it recognises religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine conversely religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policy-making certain groups such as scientology children of god the unification church or the order of the solar temple are considered cults sectes in french and therefore do not have the same status as recognised religions in france secte is considered a pejorative term in france

as of  2007 approximately 140,000 inhabitants 0.4 of france are living with hivaidseven if the french have the reputation of being one of the thinnest people in developed countries
france—like other rich countries—faces an increasing and recent epidemic of obesity due mostly to the replacement in french eating habits of traditional healthy french cuisine by junk food the french obesity rate is still far below that of the united states the obesity rate in france is the same as the united states had in the 1970s and is still the lowest of europe authorities now regard obesity as one of the main public health issues and fight it fiercely rates of childhood obesity are slowing in france while continuing to grow in other countries


 education 

in 1802 napoleon created the lycée nevertheless it is jules ferry who is considered to be the father of the french modern school which is free secular and compulsory until the age of 13 since 1882 school attendance in france is now compulsory until the age of 16
nowadays the schooling system in france is centralised and is composed of three stages primary education secondary education and higher education the programme for international student assessment coordinated by the oecd ranked frances education as about the oecd average in 2015 primary and secondary education are predominantly public run by the ministry of national education in france education is compulsory from six to sixteen years old and the public school is secular and free while training and remuneration of teachers and the curriculum are the responsibility of the state centrally the management of primary and secondary schools is overseen by local authorities primary education comprises two phases nursery school école maternelle and elementary school école élémentaire nursery school aims to stimulate the minds of very young children and promote their socialisation and development of a basic grasp of language and number around the age of six children transfer to elementary school whose primary objectives are learning about writing arithmetic and citizenship secondary education also consists of two phases the first is delivered through colleges collège and leads to the national certificate diplôme national du brevet the second is offered in high schools lycée and finishes in national exams leading to a baccalaureate baccalauréat available in professional technical or general flavours or certificate of professional competence certificat daptitude professionelle

 culture 

france has been a centre of western cultural development for centuries many french artists have been among the most renowned of their time and france is still recognised in the world for its rich cultural tradition
the successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation and the creation of the ministry of culture in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public the ministry of culture has been very active since its creation granting subsidies to artists promoting french culture in the world supporting festivals and cultural events protecting historical monuments the french government also succeeded in maintaining a cultural exception to defend audiovisual products made in the country
france receives the highest number of tourists per year largely thanks to the numerous cultural establishments and historical buildings implanted all over the territory it counts 1,200 museums welcoming more than 50 million people annually the most important cultural sites are run by the government for instance through the public agency centre des monuments nationaux which is responsible for approximately 85 national historical monuments
the 43,180 buildings protected as historical monuments include mainly residences many castles and religious buildings cathedrals basilicas churches but also statutes memorials and gardens the unesco inscribed 41 sites in france on the world heritage list


 art 

the origins of french art were very much influenced by flemish art and by italian art at the time of the renaissance jean fouquet the most famous medieval french painter is said to have been the first to travel to italy and experience the early renaissance at first hand the renaissance painting school of fontainebleau was directly inspired by italian painters such as primaticcio and rosso fiorentino who both worked in france two of the most famous french artists of the time of baroque era nicolas poussin and claude lorrain lived in italy

the 17th century was the period when french painting became prominent and individualised itself through classicism louis xivs prime minister jean-baptiste colbert founded in 1648 the royal academy of painting and sculpture to protect these artists and in 1666 he created the still-active french academy in rome to have direct relations with italian artists
french artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style the works of the court-endorsed artists antoine watteau françois boucher and jean-honoré fragonard being the most representative in the country the french revolution brought great changes as napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as jacques-louis david and the highly influential académie des beaux-arts defined the style known as academism at this time france had become a centre of artistic creation the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements at first romanticism with théodore géricault and eugène delacroix and realism with camille corot gustave courbet and jean-françois millet a style that eventually evolved into naturalism

in the second part of the 19th century frances influence over painting became even more important with the development of new styles of painting such as impressionism and symbolism the most famous impressionist painters of the period were camille pissarro édouard manet edgar degas claude monet and auguste renoir the second generation of impressionist-style painters paul cézanne paul gauguin toulouse-lautrec and georges seurat were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions as well as the fauvist artists henri matisse andré derain and maurice de vlaminckat the beginning of the 20th century cubism was developed by georges braque and the spanish painter pablo picasso living in paris other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near paris such as vincent van gogh marc chagall amedeo modigliani and wassily kandinsky
many museums in france are entirely or partly devoted to sculptures and painting works a huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state-owned musée du louvre such as mona lisa also known as la joconde while the louvre palace has been for a long time a museum the musée dorsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station gare dorsay in a major reorganisation of national art collections to gather french paintings from the second part of the 19th century mainly impressionism and fauvism movementsmodern works are presented in the musée national dart moderne which moved in 1976 to the centre georges pompidou these three state-owned museums welcome close to 17 million people a year other national museums hosting paintings include the grand palais 1.3 million visitors in 2008 but there are also many museums owned by cities the most visited being the musée dart moderne de la ville de paris 0.8 million entries in 2008 which hosts contemporary works outside paris all the large cities have a museum of fine arts with a section dedicated to european and french painting some of the finest collections are in lyon lille rouen dijon rennes and grenoble


 architecture 

during the middle ages many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers some french castles that survived are chinon château dangers the massive château de vincennes and the so-called cathar castles during this era france had been using romanesque architecture like most of western europe some of the greatest examples of romanesque churches in france are the saint sernin basilica in toulouse the largest romanesque church in europe and the remains of the cluniac abbey
the gothic architecture originally named opus francigenum meaning french work was born in île-de-france and was the first french style of architecture to be copied in all europe northern france is the home of some of the most important gothic cathedrals and basilicas the first of these being the saint denis basilica used as the royal necropolis other important french gothic cathedrals are notre-dame de chartres and notre-dame damiens the kings were crowned in another important gothic church notre-dame de reims aside from churches gothic architecture had been used for many religious palaces the most important one being the palais des papes in avignon
the final victory in the hundred years war marked an important stage in the evolution of french architecture it was the time of the french renaissance and several artists from italy were invited to the french court many residential palaces were built in the loire valley from 1450 with as a first reference the château de montsoreau such residential castles were the château de chambord the château de chenonceau or the château damboise

following the renaissance and the end of the middle ages baroque architecture replaced the traditional gothic style however in france baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one in the secular domain the palace of versailles has many baroque features jules hardouin mansart who designed the extensions to versailles was one of the most influential french architect of the baroque era he is famous for his dome at les invalides some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet french such as the place stanislas in nancy on the military architectural side vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in europe and became an influential military architect as a result imitations of his works can be found all over europe the americas russia and turkey

after the revolution the republicans favoured neoclassicism although neoclassicism was introduced in france prior to the revolution with such building as the parisian pantheon or the capitole de toulouse built during the first french empire the arc de triomphe and sainte marie-madeleine represent the best example of empire style architectureunder napoleon iii a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroque palais garnier were built the urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous for example haussmanns renovation of paris the architecture associated to this era is named second empire in english the term being taken from the second french empire at this time there was a strong gothic resurgence across europe and in france the associated architect was eugène viollet-le-duc in the late 19th century gustave eiffel designed many bridges such as garabit viaduct and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time although he is best remembered for the iconic eiffel tower
in the 20th century french-swiss architect le corbusier designed several buildings in france more recently french architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles the louvre pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building the most difficult buildings to integrate within french cities are skyscrapers as they are visible from afar for instance in paris since 1977 new buildings had to be under 37 meters 121 feet frances largest financial district is la defense where a significant number of skyscrapers are located other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges an example of the way this has been done is the millau viaduct some famous modern french architects include jean nouvel dominique perrault christian de portzamparc or paul andreu


 literature 

the earliest french literature dates from the middle ages when what is now known as modern france did not have a single uniform language there were several languages and dialects and writers used their own spelling and grammar some authors of french mediaeval texts are unknown such as tristan and iseult and lancelot-grail other authors are known for example chrétien de troyes and duke william ix of aquitaine who wrote in occitan
much medieval french poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the matter of france such as the song of roland and the various chansons de geste the roman de renart written in 1175 by perrout de saint cloude tells the story of the mediaeval character reynard the fox and is another example of early french writing an important 16th-century writer was françois rabelais whose novel gargantua and pantagruel has remained famous and appreciated until now michel de montaigne was the other major figure of the french literature during that century his most famous work essais created the literary genre of the essay french poetry during that century was embodied by pierre de ronsard and joachim du bellay both writers founded the la pléiade literary movement
during the 17th century madame de la fayette published anonymously la princesse de clèves a novel that is considered to be one of the very first psychological novels of all times jean de la fontaine is one of the most famous fabulists of that time as he wrote hundreds of fables some being far more famous than others such as the ant and the grasshopper generations of french pupils had to learn his fables that were seen as helping teaching wisdom and common sense to the young people some of his verses have entered the popular language to become proverbs such as à lœuvre on connaît lartisana workman is known by his chips

jean racine whose incredible mastery of the alexandrine and of the french language has been praised for centuries created plays such as phèdre or britannicus he is along with pierre corneille le cid and molière considered as one of the three great dramatists of the frances golden age molière who is deemed to be one of the greatest masters of comedy of the western literature wrote dozens of plays including le misanthrope lavare le malade imaginaire and le bourgeois gentilhomme his plays have been so popular around the world that french language is sometimes dubbed as the language of molière la langue de molière just like english is considered as the language of shakespeare
french literature and poetry flourished even more in the 18th and 19th centuries denis diderots best-known works are jacques the fatalist and rameaus nephew he is however best known for being the main redactor of the encyclopédie whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century in fields such as arts sciences languages philosophy and to present them to the people in order to fight ignorance and obscurantism during that same century charles perrault was a prolific writer of famous childrens fairy tales including puss in boots cinderella sleeping beauty and bluebeard at the start of the 19th century symbolist poetry was an important movement in french literature with poets such as charles baudelaire paul verlaine and stéphane mallarméthe 19th century saw the writings of many renowned french authors victor hugo is sometimes seen as the greatest french writer of all times for excelling in all literary genres the preface of his play cromwell is considered to be the manifesto of the romantic movement les contemplations and la légende des siècles are considered as poetic masterpieces hugos verse having been compared to that of shakespeare dante and homer his novel les misérables is widely seen as one of the greatest novel ever written and the hunchback of notre dame has remained immensely popular
other major authors of that century include alexandre dumas the three musketeers and the count of monte-cristo jules verne twenty thousand leagues under the sea émile zola les rougon-macquart honoré de balzac la comédie humaine guy de maupassant théophile gautier and stendhal the red and the black the charterhouse of parma whose works are among the most well known in france and the world the prix goncourt is a french literary prize first awarded in 1903 important writers of the 20th century include marcel proust louis-ferdinand céline albert camus and jean-paul sartre antoine de saint exupéry wrote little prince which has remained popular for decades with children and adults around the world as of  2014 french authors had more literature nobel prizes than those of any other nation the first nobel prize in literature was a french author while frances latest nobel prize in literature is patrick modiano who was awarded the prize in 2014 jean-paul sartre was also the first nominee in the committees history to refuse the prize in 1964


 philosophy 

medieval philosophy was dominated by scholasticism until the emergence of humanism in the renaissance modern philosophy began in france in the 17th century with the philosophy of rené descartes blaise pascal and nicolas malebranche descartes revitalised western philosophy which had been declined after the greek and roman eras his meditations on first philosophy changed the primary object of philosophical thought and raised some of the most fundamental problems for foreigners such as spinoza leibniz hume berkeley and kant

french philosophers produced some of the most important political works of the age of enlightenment in the spirit of the laws baron de montesquieu theorised the principle of separation of powers which has been implemented in all liberal democracies since it was first applied in the united states voltaire came to embody the enlightenment with his defence of civil liberties such as the right to a free trial and freedom of religion
19th-century french thought was targeted at responding to the social malaise following the french revolution rationalist philosophers such as victor cousin and auguste comte who called for a new social doctrine were opposed by reactionary thinkers such as joseph de maistre louis de bonald and félicité robert de lamennais who blamed the rationalist rejection of traditional order de maistre is considered together with the englishman edmund burke one of the founders of european conservatism while comte is regarded as the founder of positivism which émile durkheim reformulated as a basis for social research
in the 20th century partly as a reaction to the perceived excesses of positivism french spiritualism thrived with thinkers such as henri bergson and it influenced american pragmatism and whiteheads version of process philosophy meanwhile french epistemology became a prominent school of thought with jules henri poincaré gaston bachelard jean cavaillès and jules vuillemin influenced by german phenomenology and existentialism the philosophy of jean-paul sartre gained a strong influence after world war ii and late-20th-century-france became the cradle of postmodern philosophy with jean-françois lyotard jean baudrillard jacques derrida and michel foucault


 music 

france has a long and varied musical history it experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to louis xiv who employed a number of talented musicians and composers in the royal court the most renowned composers of this period include marc-antoine charpentier françois couperin michel-richard delalande jean-baptiste lully and marin marais all of them composers at the court after the death of the roi soleil french musical creation lost dynamism but in the next century the music of jean-philippe rameau reached some prestige and today he is still one of the most renowned french composers rameau became the dominant composer of french opera and the leading french composer for the harpsichord

french composers played an important role during the music of the 19th and early 20th century which is considered to be the romantic music era romantic music emphasised a surrender to nature a fascination with the past and the supernatural the exploration of unusual strange and surprising sounds and a focus on national identity this period was also a golden age for operas french composers from the romantic era included hector berlioz best known for his symphonie fantastique georges bizet best known for carmen which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas gabriel fauré best known for his pavane requiem and nocturnes charles gounod best known for his ave maria and his opera faust jacques offenbach best known for his 100 operettas of the 1850s–1870s and his uncompleted opera the tales of hoffmann édouard lalo best known for his symphonie espagnole for violin and orchestra and his cello concerto in d minor jules massenet best known for his operas of which he wrote more than thirty the most frequently staged are manon 1884 and werther 1892 and camille saint-saëns he has many frequently-performed works including the carnival of the animals danse macabre samson and delilah opera introduction and rondo capriccioso and his symphony no 3

later came precursors of modern classical music érik satie was a key member of the early-20th-century parisian avant-garde best known for his gymnopédies francis poulencs best known works are his piano suite trois mouvements perpétuels 1919 the ballet les biches 1923 the concert champêtre 1928 for harpsichord and orchestra the opera dialogues des carmélites 1957 and the gloria 1959 for soprano choir and orchestra maurice ravel and claude debussy are the most prominent figures associated with impressionist music debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed debussys music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality the two composers invented new musical forms and new sounds ravels piano compositions such as jeux deau miroirs le tombeau de couperin and gaspard de la nuit demand considerable virtuosity his mastery of orchestration is evident in the rapsodie espagnole daphnis et chloé his arrangement of modest mussorgskys pictures at an exhibition and his orchestral work boléro 1928 more recently the middle of the 20th century maurice ohana pierre schaeffer and pierre boulez contributed to the evolutions of contemporary classical music

french music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music at the middle of the 20th century although english-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country french pop music known as chanson française has also remained very popular among the most important french artists of the century are édith piaf georges brassens léo ferré charles aznavour and serge gainsbourg although there are very few rock bands in france compared to english-speaking countries bands such as noir désir mano negra niagara les rita mitsouko and more recently superbus phoenix and gojira or shaka ponk have reached worldwide popularity
other french artists with international careers have been popular in several countries for example female singers dalida mireille mathieu mylène farmer alizée and nolwenn leroy electronic music pioneers jean-michel jarre laurent garnier and bob sinclar and later martin solveig and david guetta in the 1990s and 2000s decade electronic duos daft punk justice and air also reached worldwide popularity and contributed to the reputation of modern electronic music in the worldamong current musical events and institutions in france many are dedicated to classical music and operas the most prestigious institutions are the state-owned paris national opera with its two sites palais garnier and opéra bastille the opéra national de lyon the théâtre du châtelet in paris the théâtre du capitole in toulouse and the grand théâtre de bordeaux as for music festivals there are several events organised the most popular being eurockéennes a word play which sounds in french as european solidays and rock en seine the fête de la musique imitated by many foreign cities was first launched by the french government in 1982 major music halls and venues in france include le zénith sites present in many cities and other places in paris paris olympia théâtre mogador élysée montmartre
