this is a comparison of orbital launch systems the following exposes the full list of conventional orbital launch systems for the short simple list of conventional launcher families see comparison of orbital launchers families for the list of predominantly solid-fuelled orbital launch systems see comparison of solid-fuelled orbital launch systems
spacecraft propulsion is any method used to accelerate spacecraft and artificial satellites a conventional solid rocket or a conventional solid-fuel rocket is a rocket with a motor that uses solid propellants fueloxidizer orbital launch systems are rockets and other systems capable of placing payloads into or beyond earth orbit all current spacecraft use conventional chemical rockets bipropellant or solid-fuel for launch though some have used air-breathing engines on their first stage

the following chart shows the number of launch systems developed in each country and broken down by operational status rocket variants are not distinguished ie the atlas v series is only counted once for all its configurations 401–431 501–551 552 and n22
