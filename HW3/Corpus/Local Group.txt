the local group is the galaxy group that includes the milky way the local group comprises more than 54 galaxies most of them dwarf galaxies its gravitational center is located somewhere between the milky way and the andromeda galaxy the local group has a diameter of 10 mly 3.1 mpc about 1023 meters and has a binary dumbbell
distribution the group itself is a part of the larger virgo supercluster which may be a part of the laniakea supercluster
the three largest members of the group in descending order are the andromeda galaxy the milky way and the significantly smaller triangulum galaxy the larger two of these spiral galaxies each have their own system of satellite galaxies

the andromeda galaxys satellite system consists of messier 32 m32 messier 110 m110 ngc 147 ngc 185 andromeda i and i and ii and iii and v and vi also known as pegasus dwarf spheroidal galaxy or pegasus dsph and vii also known as cassiopeia dwarf galaxy and viii and ix and x and xi and xix and xxi and and xxii plus several additional ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies
the milky ways satellite galaxies system comprises sagittarius dwarf galaxy large magellanic cloud small magellanic cloud canis major dwarf galaxy disputed considered by some not a galaxy ursa minor dwarf galaxy draco dwarf galaxy carina dwarf galaxy sextans dwarf galaxy sculptor dwarf galaxy fornax dwarf galaxy leo i a dwarf galaxy leo ii a dwarf galaxy and ursa major i dwarf galaxy and ursa major ii dwarf galaxy plus several additional ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies
the triangulum galaxy may or may not be a companion to the andromeda galaxy pisces dwarf galaxy is equidistant from the andromeda galaxy and the triangulum galaxy so it may be a satellite of either
the membership of ngc 3109 with its companions sextans a and the antlia dwarf galaxy is uncertain due to extreme distances from the center of the local group
the other members of the group are likely gravitationally secluded from these large subgroups ic 10 ic 1613 phoenix dwarf galaxy leo a tucana dwarf galaxy cetus dwarf galaxy pegasus dwarf irregular galaxy wolf–lundmark–melotte aquarius dwarf galaxy and sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy


 history 
the term the local group was introduced by edwin hubble in chapter vi of his 1936 book the realm of the nebulae there he described it as a typical small group of nebulae which is isolated in the general field and delineated by decreasing luminosity its members to be m31 milky way m33 large magellanic cloud small magellanic cloud m32 ngc 205 ngc 6822 ngc 185 ic 1613 and ngc 147 he also identified ic 10 as a possible part of local group
by 2003 the number of known local group members had increased from his initial 12 to 36
