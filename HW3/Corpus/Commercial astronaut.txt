a commercial astronaut is a person trained to command pilot or serve as a crew member of a privately funded spacecraft this is distinct from an otherwise non-government astronaut for example charlie walker who flies while representing a non-government corporation but with funding andor training coming from government sources


 criteria 
the definition of “astronaut” and the criteria for determining who has achieved human spaceflight vary the fai defines spaceflight as any flight over 100 kilometers 62 mi of altitude in the united states professional military and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of 80 kilometers 50 mi are eligible to be awarded astronaut wings until 2003 professional space travelers were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments whether by the military or by civilian space agencies however with the first sub-orbital flight of the privately funded scaled composites tier one in 2004 the commercial astronaut category was created
criteria for commercial astronaut status in other countries has yet to be made public


 faa commercial astronaut rating 
with the advent of private commercial space flight ventures in the us the faa has been faced with the task of developing a certification process for the pilots of commercial spacecraft the commercial space launch act of 1984 established the faas office of commercial space transportation and required companies to obtain a launch license for vehicles but at the time manned commercial flight - and the licensing of crewmembers - was not considered the commercial space launch amendments act has led to the issuance of draft guidelines by the faa in february 2005 for the administration of vehicle and crew certifications currently the faa has not issued formal regulatory guidance for the issuance of a commercial astronaut certificate but as an interim measure has established the practice of awarding commercial astronaut wings to commercial pilots who have demonstrated the requisite proficiency the content of 14 cfr part 460 implies that an instrument rating and second-class medical certificate issued within the 12 months prior to the proposed qualifying flight will be included as a minimum standard
the faa’s commercial astronaut wings program is designed to recognize flight crewmembers who further the faa’s mission to promote the safety of vehicles designed to carry humans astronaut wings are given to flight crew who have demonstrated a safe flight to and return from space on an faaast licensed mission to be eligible for faa astronaut wings nominees have to meet the following criteria and submit an application to the faa
must be an faa licensed launch
must meet the requirements for flight crew qualifications and training under title 14 of the code of federal regulations part 460 and
must demonstrate flight beyond 50 statute miles above the surface of the earth as flight crew on an faa licensed or permitted launch reentry vehicle


 astronaut wings 
the emblem for the first set of faa commercial astronaut wings issued in 2004 has in its center a green globe on a blue background with the three-prong astronaut symbol superimposed on top in yellow block text around the globe are the words commercial space transportation in all capital letters in a gold ring outside the blue are the words department of transportation federal aviation administration in black beginning with the wings awarded for flights in 2018 the design has been simplified to be the astronaut symbol surrounded by the words commercial space transportation all in gold on a black background
