asteroid 2011 qf99 is a minor planet from the outer solar system and the first known uranus trojan to be discovered it measures approximately 60 kilometers in diameter assuming an albedo of 0.05 it was first  observed 29 august 2011 during a deep survey of trans-neptunian objects conducted with the canada–france–hawaii telescope but its identification as uranian trojan was not announced until 2013.2011 qf99 temporarily orbits near uranuss l4 lagrangian point leading uranus it will continue to librate around l4 for at least 70,000 years and will remain a uranus co-orbital for up to three million years before becoming a centaur 2011 qf99 is thus a temporary uranus trojan—a centaur captured some time agouranus trojans are generally expected to be unstable and none of them are thought to be of primordial origin a simulation led to the conclusion that at any given time 0.4% of the centaurs in the scattered population within 34 au would be uranus co-orbitals of which 64% 0.256% of all centaurs would be in horseshoe orbits 10% 0.04 would be quasi-satellites and 26% 0.104 would be trojans evenly split between the l4 and l5 groups a second uranian trojan 2014 yx49 was announced in 2017
