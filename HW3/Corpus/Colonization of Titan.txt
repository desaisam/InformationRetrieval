saturn’s largest moon titan is one of several candidates for possible future colonization of the outer solar system
according to cassini data from 2008 titan has hundreds of times more liquid hydrocarbons than all the known oil and natural gas reserves on earth these hydrocarbons rain from the sky and collect in vast deposits that form lakes and dunes titan is just covered in carbon-bearing material—its a giant factory of organic chemicals said ralph lorenz who leads the study of titan based on radar data from cassini this vast carbon inventory is an important window into the geology and climate history of titan several hundred lakes and seas have been observed with several dozen estimated to contain more hydrocarbon liquid than earths oil and gas reserves the dark dunes that run along the equator contain a volume of organics several hundred times larger than earths coal reserves

radar images obtained on july 21 2006 appear to show lakes of liquid hydrocarbon such as methane and ethane in titans northern latitudes this is the first discovery of currently existing lakes beyond earth the lakes range in size from about a kilometer in width to one hundred kilometers across
on march 13 2007 jet propulsion laboratory announced that it found strong evidence of seas of methane and ethane in the northern hemisphere at least one of these is larger than any of the great lakes in north america


 suitability 
the american aerospace engineer and author robert zubrin identified saturn as the most important and valuable of the four gas giants in the solar system because of its relative proximity low radiation and excellent system of moons he also named titan as the most important moon on which to establish a base to develop the resources of the saturn system


 habitability 
robert zubrin has pointed out that titan possesses an abundance of all the elements necessary to support life saying in certain ways titan is the most hospitable extraterrestrial world within our solar system for human colonization the atmosphere contains plentiful nitrogen and methane and strong evidence indicates that liquid methane exists on the surface  evidence also indicates the presence of liquid water and ammonia under the surface which are delivered to the surface by volcanic activity water can be used to generate breathable oxygen and nitrogen is ideal to add buffer gas partial pressure to breathable air it forms about 78% of earths atmosphere nitrogen methane and ammonia can all be used to produce fertilizer for growing food


 in situ energy resources 
in situ energy resources on titan for use by future humans include chemical nuclear wind solar and hydropower electrical power could be produced using chemical power plants adding hydrogen to acetylene ie hydrogenation oxygen is not freely available or turbines in large methane seas such as kraken mare where the tidal pull of saturn causes up to a meter of tidal change each titan day 


 gravity 
titan has a surface gravity of 0.138 g slightly less than the moon managing long-term effects of low gravity on human health would therefore be a significant issue for long-term occupation of titan more so than on mars these effects are still an active field of study they can include symptoms such as loss of bone density loss of muscle density and a weakened immune system astronauts in earth orbit have remained in microgravity for up to a year or more at a time effective countermeasures for the negative effects of low gravity are well-established particularly an aggressive regime of daily physical exercise or weighted clothing the variation in the negative effects of low gravity as a function of different levels of low gravity are not known since all research in this area is restricted to humans in zero gravity the same goes for the potential effects of low gravity on fetal and pediatric development it has been hypothesized that children born and raised in low gravity such as on titan would not be well adapted for life under the higher gravity of earth


 flight 
the very high ratio of atmospheric density to surface gravity also greatly reduces the wingspan needed for an aircraft to maintain lift so much so that a human would be able to strap on wings and easily fly through titans atmosphere while wearing a sort of spacesuit that could be manufactured with todays technology another theoretically possible means to become airborne on titan would be to use a hot air balloon-like vehicle filled with an earth-like atmosphere at earth-like temperatures because oxygen is only slightly denser than nitrogen the atmosphere in a habitat on titan would be about one third as dense as the surrounding atmosphere although such a vehicle would need a skin able to keep the extreme cold out in spite of the light weight required due to titans extremely low temperatures heating of any flight-bound vehicle becomes a key obstacle
