the gemini astronauts were pilots who flew in project gemini nasas second human spaceflight program between projects mercury and apollo  carrying two astronauts at a time a senior command pilot and a junior pilot the gemini spacecraft was used for ten crewed missions  sixteen astronauts flew on these missions with four flying twicegemini was the second phase in the united states space programs larger goal of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth before the end of the 1960s as proposed by president john f kennedy  as an intermediary step gemini afforded its astronauts the opportunity to gain critical spaceflight experience performing tasks required in the later apollo program which fulfilled this objective  such tasks included rendezvous or station-keeping with other craft docking habitation in space over the course of several days and flying spacecraft with more than one crew member  importantly most individuals who flew as gemini astronauts returned to space as key personnel in the apollo program bringing with them their first-hand experience of the operations carried out during gemini  among the gemini astronauts six later walked on the moon another five flew to the moon without landing and two participated in low earth orbit apollo missions  gus grissom and ed white were killed in the apollo 1 disaster and former mercury astronaut gordon cooper did not perform any further spaceflights
astronaut participation in project gemini was also a strong predictor for future achievement during the apollo program

every apollo mission commander including gus grissom and with the exception of alan shepard was a gemini veteran
all three crew members of apollo 11 the first lunar landing-neil armstrong michael collins and buzz aldrin-were gemini veterans
all three of the men who flew to the moon twice-jim lovell john young and gene cernan-were gemini veterans
with the exception of elliot see every member of nasas second astronaut group—the class of nine men selected following the mercury seven—flew as a gemini astronaut
