 name and etymology 
the description of the country by the word argentina has been found on a venetian map in 1536in english the name argentina comes from the spanish language however the naming itself is not spanish but italian argentina masculine argentino means in italian made of silver silver coloured probably borrowed from the old french adjective argentine made of silver  silver coloured already mentioned in the 12th century the french word argentine is the feminine form of argentin and derives from argent silver with the suffix -in same construction as old french acerin made of steel from acier steel  -in or sapin made of fir wood from of sap fir  -in the italian naming argentina for the country implies terra argentina land of silver or costa argentina coast of silver in italian the adjective or the proper noun is often used in an autonomous way as a substantive and replaces it and it is said largentina
the name argentina was probably first given by the venetian and genoese navigators such as giovanni caboto in spanish and portuguese the words for silver are respectively plata and prata and made of silver is said plateado and prateado argentina was first associated with the silver mountains legend widespread among the first european explorers of the la plata basinthe first written use of the name in spanish can be traced to la argentina a 1602 poem by martín del barco centenera describing the region
although argentina was already in common usage by the 18th century the country was formally named viceroyalty of the río de la plata by the spanish empire and united provinces of the río de la plata after independence
the 1826 constitution included the first use of the name argentine republic in legal documents
the name argentine confederation was also commonly used and was formalized in the argentine constitution of 1853
in 1860 a presidential decree settled the countrys name as argentine republic and that years constitutional amendment ruled all the names since 1810 as legally validin the english language the country was traditionally called the argentine mimicking the typical spanish usage la argentina and perhaps resulting from a mistaken shortening of the fuller name argentine republic the argentine fell out of fashion during the mid-to-late 20th century and now the country is simply referred to as argentina
in the spanish language argentina is feminine la república argentina taking the feminine article la as the initial syllable of argentina is unstressed


 history 


 pre-columbian era 

the earliest traces of human life in the area now known as argentina are dated from the paleolithic period with further traces in the mesolithic and neolithic
until the period of european colonization argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a wide number of diverse cultures with different social organizations which can be divided into three main groups the first group are basic hunters and food gatherers without development of pottery such as the selknam and yaghan in the extreme south the second group are advanced hunters and food gatherers which include the puelche querandí and serranos in the center-east and the tehuelche in the south—all of them conquered by the mapuche spreading from chile—and the kom and wichi in the north the last group are farmers with pottery like the charrúa minuane and guaraní in the northeast with slash and burn semisedentary existence the advanced diaguita sedentary trading culture in the northwest which was conquered by the inca empire around 1480 the toconoté and hênîa and kâmîare in the countrys center and the huarpe in the center-west a culture that raised llama cattle and was strongly influenced by the incas


 colonial era 

europeans first arrived in the region with the 1502 voyage of amerigo vespucci the spanish navigators juan díaz de solís and sebastian cabot visited the territory that is now argentina in 1516 and 1526 respectively in 1536 pedro de mendoza founded the small settlement of buenos aires which was abandoned in 1541further colonization efforts came from paraguay—establishing the governorate of the río de la plata—peru and chilefrancisco de aguirre founded santiago del estero in 1553 londres was founded in 1558 mendoza in 1561 san juan in 1562 san miguel de tucumán in 1565 juan de garay founded santa fe in 1573 and the same year jerónimo luis de cabrera set up córdoba garay went further south to re-found buenos aires in 1580 san luis was established in 1596the spanish empire subordinated the economic potential of the argentine territory to the immediate wealth of the silver and gold mines in bolivia and peru and as such it became part of the viceroyalty of peru until the creation of the viceroyalty of the río de la plata in 1776 with buenos aires as its capitalbuenos aires repelled two ill-fated british invasions in 1806 and 1807 the ideas of the age of enlightenment and the example of the first atlantic revolutions generated criticism of the absolutist monarchy that ruled the country as in the rest of spanish america the overthrow of ferdinand vii during the peninsular war created great concern


 independence and civil wars 

beginning a process from which argentina was to emerge as successor state to the viceroyalty the 1810 may revolution replaced the viceroy baltasar hidalgo de cisneros with the first junta a new government in buenos aires composed by locals
in the first clashes of the independence war the junta crushed a royalist counter-revolution in córdoba but failed to overcome those of the banda oriental upper peru and paraguay which later became independent statesrevolutionaries split into two antagonist groups the centralists and the federalists—a move that would define argentinas first decades of independence the assembly of the year xiii appointed gervasio antonio de posadas as argentinas first supreme directoron 9 july 1816 the congress of tucumán formalized the declaration of independence which is now celebrated as independence day a national holiday one year later general martín miguel de güemes stopped royalists on the north and general josé de san martín took an army across the andes and secured the independence of chile then he led the fight to the spanish stronghold of lima and proclaimed the independence of peru in 1819 buenos aires enacted a centralist constitution that was soon abrogated by federaliststhe 1820 battle of cepeda fought between the centralists and the federalists resulted in the end of the supreme director rule in 1826 buenos aires enacted another centralist constitution with bernardino rivadavia being appointed as the first president of the country however the interior provinces soon rose against him forced his resignation and discarded the constitution centralists and federalists resumed the civil war the latter prevailed and formed the argentine confederation in 1831 led by juan manuel de rosas during his regime he faced a french blockade 1838–1840 the war of the confederation 1836–1839 and a combined anglo-french blockade 1845–1850 but remained undefeated and prevented further loss of national territory his trade restriction policies however angered the interior provinces and in 1852 justo josé de urquiza another powerful caudillo beat him out of power as new president of the confederation urquiza enacted the liberal and federal 1853 constitution buenos aires seceded but was forced back into the confederation after being defeated in the 1859 battle of cepeda


 rise of the modern nation 

overpowering urquiza in the 1861 battle of pavón bartolomé mitre secured buenos aires predominance and was elected as the first president of the reunified country he was followed by domingo faustino sarmiento and nicolás avellaneda these three presidencies set up the bases of the modern argentine statestarting with julio argentino roca in 1880 ten consecutive federal governments emphasized liberal economic policies the massive wave of european immigration they promoted—second only to the united states—led to a near-reinvention of argentine society and economy that by 1908 had placed the country as the seventh wealthiest developed nation in the world
driven by this immigration wave and decreasing mortality the argentine population grew fivefold and the economy 15-fold from 1870 to 1910 argentinas wheat exports went from 100,000 to 2,500,000 t 110,000 to 2,760,000 short tons per year while frozen beef exports increased from 25,000 to 365,000 t 28,000 to 402,000 short tons per year placing argentina as one of the worlds top five exporters its railway mileage rose from 503 to 31,104 km 313 to 19,327 mi fostered by a new public compulsory free and secular education system literacy skyrocketed from 22% to 65 a level higher than most latin american nations would reach even fifty years later furthermore real gdp grew so fast that despite the huge immigration influx per capita income between 1862 and 1920 went from 67% of developed country levels to 100 in 1865 argentina was already one of the top 25 nations by per capita income by 1908 it had surpassed denmark canada and the netherlands to reach 7th place—behind switzerland new zealand australia the united states the united kingdom and belgium argentinas per capita income was 70% higher than italys 90% higher than spains 180% higher than japans and 400% higher than brazils despite these unique achievements the country was slow to meet its original goals of industrialization after steep development of capital-intensive local industries in the 1920s a significant part of the manufacture sector remained labor-intensive in the 1930s

between 1878 and 1884 the so-called conquest of the desert and chaco occurred with the purpose of giving by means of the constant confrontations between natives and criollos in the border and the appropriation of the indigenous territories tripling the argentine territory the first conquest consisted of a series of military incursions into the pampa and patagonian territories dominated by the indigenous peoples distributing them among the members of the rural society financiers of the expeditions the conquest of chaco lasted up to fines of the century since its full ownership of the national economic system only took place when the mere extraction of wood and tannin was replaced by the production of cotton the argentine government considered indigenous people as inferior beings without the same rights as criollos and europeansin 1912 president roque sáenz peña enacted universal and secret male suffrage which allowed hipólito yrigoyen leader of the radical civic union or ucr to win the 1916 election he enacted social and economic reforms and extended assistance to small farms and businesses argentina stayed neutral during world war i the second administration of yrigoyen faced an economic crisis precipitated by the great depression


 infamous decade 

in 1930 yrigoyen was ousted from power by the military led by josé félix uriburu although argentina remained among the fifteen richest countries until mid-century this coup détat marks the start of the steady economic and social decline that pushed the country back into underdevelopment

uriburu ruled for two years then agustín pedro justo was elected in a fraudulent election and signed a controversial treaty with the united kingdom argentina stayed neutral during world war ii a decision that had full british support but was rejected by the united states after the attack on pearl harbor a new military coup toppled the government and argentina declared war on the axis powers on march 27 1945 a month before the end of world war ii in europe the minister of welfare juan domingo perón was fired and jailed because of his high popularity among workers his liberation was forced by a massive popular demonstration and he went on to win the 1946 election


 peronist years 

perón created a political movement known as peronism he nationalized strategic industries and services improved wages and working conditions paid the full external debt and achieved nearly full employment the economy however began to decline in 1950 because of over-expenditure his highly popular wife eva perón played a central political role she pushed congress to enact womens suffrage in 1947 and developed an unprecedented social assistance to the most vulnerable sectors of society however her declining health did not allow her to run for the vice-presidency in 1951 and she died of cancer the following year perón was reelected in 1951 surpassing even his 1946 performance in 1955 the navy bombed the plaza de mayo in an ill-fated attempt to kill the president a few months later during the self-called liberating revolution coup he resigned and went into exile in spainthe new head of state pedro eugenio aramburu proscribed peronism and banned all of its manifestations nevertheless peronists kept an organized underground arturo frondizi from the ucr won the following elections he encouraged investment to achieve energetic and industrial self-sufficiency reversed a chronic trade deficit and lifted peronism proscription yet his efforts to stay on good terms with peronists and the military earned him the rejection of both and a new coup forced him out but senate chief josé maría guido reacted swiftly and applied the anti-power vacuum legislation becoming president instead elections were repealed and peronism proscribed again arturo illia was elected in 1963 and led to an overall increase in prosperity however his attempts to legalize peronism resulted in his overthrow in 1966 by the juan carlos onganía-led coup détat called the argentine revolution creating a new military government that sought to rule indefinitely


 military dictatorship the dirty war and defeat in the falklands war 

the dirty war spanish guerra sucia was part of operation condor which included participation of the right-wing dictatorships of the southern cone the dirty war involved state terrorism in argentina and elsewhere in the southern cone against political dissidents with military and security forces employing urban and rural violence against left-wing guerrillas political dissidents and anyone believed to be associated with socialism or somehow contrary to the neoliberal economic policies of the regime victims of the violence in argentina alone included an estimated 15,000 to 30,000 left-wing activists and militants including trade unionists students journalists marxists peronist guerrillas and alleged sympathizers most were victims of state terrorism the guerrillas whose number of victims are nearly 500-540 between military and police officials and up to 230 civilians argentina received technical support and military aid from the united states government during the johnson nixon ford carter and reagan administrations

declassified documents of the chilean secret police cite an official estimate by the batallón de inteligencia 601 of 22,000 killed or disappeared between 1975 and mid-1978 during this period in which it was later revealed 8,625 disappeared in the form of pen poder ejecutivo nacional anglicized as national executive power detainees who were held in clandestine detention camps throughout argentina before eventually being freed under diplomatic pressure the number of people believed to have been killed or disappeared depending on the source range from 9,089 to 30,000 in the period from 1976 to 1983 when the military was forced from power following argentinas defeat in the falklands war the national commission on the disappearance of persons estimates that around 13,000 were disappearedafter democratic government was restored congress passed legislation to provide compensation to victims families some 11,000 argentines have applied to the relevant authorities and received up to us200,000 each as monetary compensation for the murder of loved ones during the military dictatorshipthe exact chronology of the repression is still debated however as in some senses the long political war started in 1969 trade unionists were targeted for assassination by the peronist and marxist paramilitaries as early as 1969 and individual cases of state-sponsored terrorism against peronism and the left can be traced back to the bombing of plaza de mayo in 1955 the trelew massacre of 1972 the actions of the argentine anticommunist alliance since 1973 and isabel martínez de peróns annihilation decrees against left-wing guerrillas during operativo independencia translates to operation of independence in 1975 have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the dirty war
onganía shut down congress banned all political parties and dismantled student and worker unions in 1969 popular discontent led to two massive protests the cordobazo and the rosariazo the terrorist guerrilla organization montoneros kidnapped and executed aramburu the newly chosen head of government alejandro agustín lanusse seeking to ease the growing political pressure let héctor josé cámpora be the peronist candidate instead of perón cámpora won the march 1973 election issued a pardon for condemned guerrilla members and then secured peróns return from his exile in spainon the day perón returned to argentina the clash between peronist internal factions—right-wing union leaders and left-wing youth from montoneros—resulted in the ezeiza massacre cámpora resigned overwhelmed by political violence and perón won the september 1973 election with his third wife isabel as vice-president he expelled montoneros from the party and they became once again a clandestine organization josé lópez rega organized the argentine anticommunist alliance aaa to fight against them and the peoples revolutionary army erp

the proceso shut down congress removed the judges of the supreme court banned political parties and unions and resorted to the forced disappearance of suspected guerrilla members and of anyone believed to be associated with the left-wing by the end of 1976 montoneros had lost near 2,000 members by 1977 the erp was completely defeated a severely weakened montoneros launched a counterattack in 1979 which was quickly annihilated ending the guerrilla threat nevertheless the junta stayed in power
in 1982 the then head of state general leopoldo galtieri authorised the invasion of the british territories of south georgia and on 2 april of the falkland islands this led to the falklands war with the united kingdom and an argentinian surrender on 14 june rioting on the streets of buenos aires followed the defeat and the military leadership responsible for the humiliation stood down reynaldo bignone replaced galtieri and began to organize the transition to democratic rule
