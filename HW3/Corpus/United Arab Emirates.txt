following decades of maritime conflict the coastal emirates became known as the trucial states with the signing of a perpetual treaty of maritime peace with the british in 1819 ratified in 1853 and again in 1892 which established the trucial states as a british protectorate this arrangement ended with independence and the establishment of the united arab emirates on 2 december 1971 immediately following the british withdrawal from its treaty obligations six emirates joined the uae in 1971 the seventh ras al khaimah joined the federation on 10 february 1972islam is the official religion and arabic is the official language of the uae the uaes oil reserves are the seventh-largest in the world while its natural gas reserves are the worlds seventeenth-largest sheikh zayed ruler of abu dhabi and the first president of the uae oversaw the development of the emirates and steered oil revenues into healthcare education and infrastructure the uaes economy is the most diversified in the gulf cooperation council while its most populous city of dubai is an important global city and an international aviation and maritime trade hub nevertheless the country is much less reliant on oil and gas than in previous years and is economically focusing on tourism and business the uae government does not levy income tax although there is a system of  corporate tax in place and value added tax was established  in 2018 at 5the uaes rising international profile has led to it being recognised as a regional and middle power it is a member of the united nations the arab league the organisation of islamic cooperation opec the non-aligned movement and the gulf cooperation council


 history 


 antiquity 

the land of the emirates has been occupied for thousands of years stone tools recovered from jebel faya in the emirate of sharjah reveal a settlement of people from africa some 127,000 years ago and a stone tool used for butchering animals discovered at jebel barakah on the arabian coast suggests an even older habitation from 130,000 years ago there is no proof of contact with the outside world at that stage although in time lively trading links developed with civilisations in mesopotamia iran and the harappan culture of the indus valley this contact persisted and became wide-ranging probably motivated by the trade in copper from the hajar mountains which commenced around 3,000 bce sumerian sources talk of the uae as home to the makkan or magan peoplethere are six major periods of human settlement with distinctive behaviours in the pre-islamic uae the hafit period from 3,200-2,600 bce the umm al nar culture spanned from 2,600-2,000 bce the wadi suq people dominated from 2,000–1,300 bce from 1,200 bc to the advent of islam in eastern arabia through three distinctive iron ages iron age 1 1,200–1,000 bc iron age 2 1,000–600 bc and iron age 3 600–300 bc and the mleiha period 300 bc onward the area was variously occupied by archaemenid and other forces and saw the construction of fortified settlements and extensive husbandry thanks to the development of the falaj irrigation system
in ancient times al hasa todays eastern province of saudi arabia was part of al bahreyn and adjoined greater oman todays uae and oman from the second century ad there was a movement of tribes from al bahreyn towards the lower gulf together with a migration among the azdite qahtani or yamani and qudaah tribal groups from south-west arabia towards central oman


 islam 
the spread of islam to the north eastern tip of the arabian peninsula is thought to have followed directly from a letter sent by the islamic prophet muhammad to the rulers of oman in 630 ad nine years after the hijrah this led to a group of rulers travelling to medina converting to islam and subsequently driving a successful uprising against the unpopular sasanids who dominated the northern coasts at the time following the death of muhammad the new islamic communities south of the persian gulf threatened to disintegrate with insurrections against the muslim leaders the caliph abu bakr sent an army from the capital medina which completed its reconquest of the territory the ridda wars with the battle of dibba in which 10,000 lives are thought to have been lost this assured the integrity of the caliphate and the unification of the arabian peninsula under the newly emerging rashidun caliphate
in 637 julfar in the area of todays ras al khaimah was an important port that was used as a staging post for the islamic invasion of the sasanian empire the area of the al ainburaimi oasis was known as tuam and was an important trading post for camel routes between the coast and the arabian interiorthe earliest christian site in the uae was first discovered in the 1990s an extensive monastic complex on what is now known as sir bani yas island and which dates back to the 7th century thought to be nestorian and built in 600 ad the church appears to have been abandoned peacefully in 750 ad it forms a rare physical link to a legacy of christianity which is thought to have spread across the peninsula from 50 to 350 ad following trade routes certainly by the 5th century oman had a bishop named john – the last bishop of oman being etienne in 676 ad


 ottoman and portuguese era 

the harsh desert environment led to the emergence of the versatile tribesman nomadic groups who subsisted due to a variety of economic activities including animal husbandry agriculture and hunting the seasonal movements of these groups led to not only frequent clashes between groups but also the establishment of seasonal and semi-seasonal settlements and centres these formed tribal groupings whose names are still carried by modern emiratis including the bani yas and al bu falah of abu dhabi al ain liwa and the west coast the dhawahir awamir al ali and manasir of the interior the sharqiyin of the east coast and the qawasim to the northwith the expansion of european colonialism portuguese english and dutch forces appeared in the persian gulf region by the 18th century the bani yas confederation was the dominant force in most of the area now known as abu dhabi while the northern al qawasim al qasimi dominated maritime commerce the portuguese maintained an influence over the coastal settlements building forts in the wake of the bloody 16th-century conquests of coastal communities by albuquerque and the portuguese commanders who followed him – particularly on the east coast at muscat sohar and khor fakkanthe southern coast of the persian gulf was known to the british as the pirate coast as boats of the al qawasim federation harassed british-flagged shipping from the 17th century into the 19th the charge of piracy is disputed by modern emirati historians including the current ruler of sharjah sheikh sultan al qasimi in his 1986 book the myth of arab piracy in the gulfbritish expeditions to protect the indian trade led to campaigns against ras al khaimah and other harbours along the coast including the persian gulf campaign of 1809 and the more successful campaign of 1819 the following year britain and a number of local rulers signed a maritime truce giving rise to the term trucial states which came to define the status of the coastal emirates a further treaty was signed in 1843 and in 1853 the perpetual treaty of maritime truce was agreed to this was added the exclusive agreements signed in 1892 which made the trucial states a british protectorateunder the 1892 treaty the trucial sheikhs agreed not to dispose of any territory except to the british and not to enter into relationships with any foreign government other than the british without their consent in return the british promised to protect the trucial coast from all aggression by sea and to help in case of land attack the exclusive agreement was signed by the rulers of abu dhabi dubai sharjah ajman ras al khaimah and umm al quwain between 6 and 8 march 1892 it was subsequently ratified by the viceroy of india and the british government in london british maritime policing meant that pearling fleets could operate in relative security however the british prohibition of the slave trade meant an important source of income was lost to some sheikhs and merchantsin 1869 the qubaisat tribe settled at khawr al udayd and tried to enlist the support of the ottomans whose flag was occasionally seen flying there khawr al udayd was claimed by abu dhabi at that time a claim supported by the british in 1906 the british political resident percy cox confirmed in writing to the ruler of abu dhabi zayed bin khalifa al nahyan zayed the great that khawr al udayd belonged to his sheikhdom


 british era and discovery of oil 
during the 19th and early 20th centuries the pearling industry thrived providing both income and employment to the people of the persian gulf the first world war had a severe impact on the industry but it was the economic depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s coupled with the invention of the cultured pearl that wiped out the trade the remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the second world war when the newly independent government of india imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the arab states of the persian gulf the decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the trucial states

in 1922 the british government secured undertakings from the rulers of the trucial states not to sign concessions with foreign companies without their consent aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil following finds in persia from 1908 and mesopotamia from 1927 a british-led oil company the iraq petroleum company ipc showed an interest in the region the anglo-persian oil company apoc later to become british petroleum or bp had a 23.75% share in ipc from 1935 onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers with apoc signing the first one on behalf of petroleum concessions ltd pcl an associate company of ipc apoc was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the red line agreement which required it to operate through ipc a number of options between pcl and the trucial rulers were signed providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade however the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as iran bahrain kuwait qatar and saudi arabia remained elusive the first bore holes in abu dhabi were drilled by ipcs operating company petroleum development trucial coast ltd pdtc at ras sadr in 1950 with a 13,000-foot-deep 4,000-metre bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry at the tremendous cost at the time of £1 million

the british set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates the seven sheikhs of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office in 1952 they formed the trucial states council and appointed adi bitar dubais sheikh rashids legal advisor as secretary general and legal advisor to the council the council was terminated once the united arab emirates was formed the tribal nature of society and the lack of definition of borders between emirates frequently led to disputes settled either through mediation or more rarely force the trucial oman scouts was a small military force used by the british to keep the peace
in 1953 a subsidiary of bp darcy exploration ltd obtained an offshore concession from the ruler of abu dhabi bp joined with compagnie française des pétroles later total to form operating companies abu dhabi marine areas ltd adma and dubai marine areas ltd duma a number of undersea oil surveys were carried out including one led by the famous marine explorer jacques cousteau in 1958 a floating platform rig was towed from hamburg germany and positioned over the umm shaif pearl bed in abu dhabi waters where drilling began in march it struck oil in the upper thamama a rock formation that would provide many valuable oil finds this was the first commercial discovery of the trucial coast leading to the first exports of oil in 1962 adma made further offshore discoveries at zakum and elsewhere and other companies made commercial finds such as the fateh oilfield off dubai and the mubarak field off sharjah shared with iranmeanwhile onshore exploration was hindered by territorial disputes in 1955 the united kingdom represented abu dhabi and oman in their dispute with saudi arabia over the buraimi oasis a 1974 agreement between abu dhabi and saudi arabia seemed to have settled the abu dhabi-saudi border dispute but this has not been ratified the uaes border with oman was ratified in 2008pdtc continued its onshore exploration away from the disputed area drilling five more bore holes that were also dry however on 27 october 1960 the company discovered oil in commercial quantities at the murban no 3 well on the coast near tarif in 1962 pdtc became the abu dhabi petroleum company as oil revenues increased the ruler of abu dhabi zayed bin sultan al nahyan undertook a massive construction program building schools housing hospitals and roads when dubais oil exports commenced in 1969 sheikh rashid bin saeed al maktoum the ruler of dubai was able to invest the revenues from the limited reserves found to spark the diversification drive that would create the modern global city of dubai


 independence 

by 1966 it had become clear the british government could no longer afford to administer and protect what is now the united arab emirates british mps debated the preparedness of the royal navy to defend the sheikhdoms secretary of state for defence denis healey reported that the british armed forces were seriously overstretched and in some respects dangerously under-equipped to defend the sheikhdoms on 24 january 1968 british prime minister harold wilson announced the governments decision reaffirmed in march 1971 by prime minister edward heath to end the treaty relationships with the seven trucial sheikhdoms that had been together with bahrain and qatar under british protection days after the announcement the ruler of abu dhabi sheikh zayed bin sultan al nahyan fearing vulnerability tried to persuade the british to honour the protection treaties by offering to pay the full costs of keeping the british armed forces in the emirates the british labour government rejected the offer after labour mp goronwy roberts informed sheikh zayed of the news of british withdrawal the nine persian gulf sheikhdoms attempted to form a union of arab emirates but by mid-1971 they were still unable to agree on terms of union even though the british treaty relationship was to expire in december of that yearfears of vulnerability were realized the day before independence an iranian destroyer group broke formation from an exercise in the lower gulf sailing to the tunb islands the islands were taken by force civilians and arab defenders alike allowed to flee a british warship stood idle during the course of the invasion a destroyer group approached the island abu musa as well but there sheikh khalid bin mohammed al qasimi  had already negotiated with the iranian shah and the island was quickly leased to iran for 3 million a year meanwhile saudi arabia laid claim to swathes of abu dhabioriginally intended to be part of the proposed federation of arab emirates bahrain became independent in august and qatar in september 1971 when the british-trucial sheikhdoms treaty expired on 1 december 1971 they became fully independent on 2 december 1971 at the dubai guesthouse now known as union house six of the emirates agreed to enter into a union called the united arab emirates  ras al-khaimah joined later on 10 january 1972 in february 1972 the federal national council fnc was created it was a 40-member consultative body appointed by the seven rulers the uae joined the arab league on 6 december 1971 and the united nations on 9 december it was a founding member of the gulf cooperation council in may 1981 with abu dhabi hosting the first gcc summit uae forces joined the allies against iraq after the invasion of kuwait in 1990

 geography 

the united arab emirates is situated in middle east bordering the gulf of oman and the persian gulf between oman and saudi arabia it is in a strategic location slightly south of the strait of hormuz a vital transit point for world crude oilthe uae lies between 22°30 and 26°10 north latitude and between 51° and 56°25′ east longitude it shares a 530-kilometre 330 mi border with saudi arabia on the west south and southeast and a 450-kilometre 280 mi border with oman on the southeast and northeast the land border with qatar in the khawr al udayd area is about nineteen kilometres 12 miles in the northwest however it is a source of ongoing dispute following britains military departure from the uae in 1971 and its establishment as a new state the uae laid claim to islands resulting in disputes with iran that remain unresolved the uae also disputes claim on other islands against the neighboring state of qatar the largest emirate abu dhabi accounts for 87% of the uaes total area 67,340 square kilometres 26,000 sq mi the smallest emirate ajman encompasses only 259 km2 100 sq misee figure
the uae coast stretches for more than 650 km 404 mi along the southern shore of the persian gulf most of the coast consists of salt pans that extend far inland the largest natural harbor is at dubai although other ports have been dredged at abu dhabi sharjah and elsewhere numerous islands are found in the persian gulf and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both iran and qatar the smaller islands as well as many coral reefs and shifting sandbars are a menace to navigation strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore the uae also has a stretch of the al bāţinah coast of the gulf of oman although the musandam peninsula the very tip of arabia by the strait of hormuz is an exclave of oman separated by the uae
south and west of abu dhabi vast rolling sand dunes merge into the rub al-khali empty quarter of saudi arabia the desert area of abu dhabi includes two important oases with adequate underground water for permanent settlements and cultivation the extensive liwa oasis is in the south near the undefined border with saudi arabia about 100 km 62 mi to the northeast of liwa is the al-buraimi oasis which extends on both sides of the abu dhabi-oman border lake zakher is a human-made lake near the border with oman
prior to withdrawing from the area in 1971 britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation in general the rulers of the emirates accepted the british intervention but in the case of boundary disputes between abu dhabi and dubai and also between dubai and sharjah conflicting claims were not resolved until after the uae became independent the most complicated borders were in the al-hajar al-gharbi mountains where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves


 flora and fauna 

the oases grow date palms acacia and eucalyptus trees in the desert the flora is very sparse and consists of grasses and thorn bushes the indigenous fauna had come close to extinction because of intensive hunting which has led to a conservation program on bani yas island initiated by sheikh zayed bin sultan al nahyan in the 1970s resulting in the survival of for example arabian oryx arabian camel and leopards coastal fish and mammals consist mainly of mackerel perch and tuna as well as sharks and whales


 climate 
the climate of the uae is subtropical-arid with hot summers and warm winters the climate is categorized as desert climate the hottest months are july and august when average maximum temperatures reach above 45 °c 113 °f on the coastal plain in the al hajar mountains temperatures are considerably lower a result of increased elevation average minimum temperatures in january and february are between 10 and 14 °c 50 and 57 °f during the late summer months a humid southeastern wind known as sharqi ie easterner makes the coastal region especially unpleasant the average annual rainfall in the coastal area is less than 120 mm 4.7 in but in some mountainous areas annual rainfall often reaches 350 mm 13.8 in rain in the coastal region falls in short torrential bursts during the summer months sometimes resulting in floods in ordinarily dry wadi beds the region is prone to occasional violent dust storms which can severely reduce visibility
on 28 december 2004 there was snow recorded in the uae for the very first time in the jebel jais mountain cluster in ras al-khaimah a few years later there were more sightings of snow and hail the jebel jais mountain cluster has experienced snow only twice since records began
