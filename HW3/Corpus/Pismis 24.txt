ngc 6357 is a diffuse nebula near ngc 6334 in the constellation scorpius  the nebula contains many proto-stars shielded by dark disks of gas and young stars wrapped in expanding cocoons or expanding gases surrounding these small stars it is also known as the lobster nebulathis nebula was also given the name war and peace nebula by the midcourse space experiment scientists because of its appearance they said that in infrared images the bright western part resembles a dove while the eastern part looks like a skullit is located about 5500 light years away from earth


 associated open clusters 


 pismis 24 

this nebula includes the open cluster pismis 24 which is home to several massive stars one of the brightest stars in the cluster pismis 24-1 was thought possibly to be the most massive on record approaching 300 solar masses until it was discovered to be a multiple system of at least three stars component stars would still remain near 100 solar masses each making them among the more massive stars on record


 g353.20.7 
the young stellar cluster g353.20.7 lies east of pismis 24 and was revealed by a chandra x-ray image showing approximately 800 stars


 g353.10.6 
the young stellar cluster g353.10.6 lies southeast of pismis 24 and also contains approximately 800 stars detected by x-ray the region includes several o-type stars including bdsb2003 10


 massive stars 
ngc 6357 is one of the most prominent sites of massive-star formation our neighborhood of the milky way a variety of early o-type stars reside in this nebula blowing the bubbles around the stars clusters that can be seen in the molecular cloud
