 history 
the modern dlr was created in 1997 but was the culmination of over half a dozen space aerospace and research institutes from across the 20th century
the oldest predecessor organization of dlr was established by ludwig prandtl in göttingen in 1907 this modellversuchsanstalt der motorluftschiff-studiengesellschaft mlstg german for institute for testing of aerodynamic models of the powered airship society later became the aerodynamische versuchsanstalt aerodynamics laboratory or aerodynamic experimental station in the 1940s the dvl an ava sister organization funded konrad zuses work on the z3 and z4 computers another german aviation technology research facility the 1935-founded top-secret luftfahrtforschungsanstalt at völkenrode which conducted research — much of it for military aviation to suit the luftwaffes needs — in parallel to the then-existing forerunners of the dlr of today would not be discovered by the allies until after the wars end
in 1947 the arbeitsgemeinschaft weltraumfahrt consortium on space flight was formed leading to the gesellschaft für weltraumforschung gfw  society for space research being formed in 1948in 1954 the research institute of jet propulsion physics fps was established at the stuttgart airportwhat was later called the dlr was formed in 1969 as the deutsche forschungs- und versuchsanstalt für luft- und raumfahrt dfvlr  german test and research institute for aviation and space flight through the merger of several institutions these were the aerodynamische versuchsanstalt ava the deutsche versuchsanstalt für luftfahrt dvl german laboratory for aviation the deutsche forschungsanstalt für luftfahrt dfl german research institute for aviation and in 1972 the gesellschaft für weltraumforschung gfw society for space research
in 1989 the dfvlr was renamed deutsche forschungsanstalt für luft- und raumfahrt dlr  german research institute for aviation and space flight  also in 1989 the deutsche agentur für raumfahrtangelegenheiten dara  german agency for space flight affairs was createdfollowing the merger with the deutsche agentur für raumfahrtangelegenheiten dara german for german agency for space flight affairs on 1 october 1997 the name was changed to deutsches zentrum für luft- und raumfahrt dlr literally german center for aviation and space flight the shorter translation german aerospace center is used in english-language publications
other german space organizations include the institut für raumfahrtsysteme irs institute for space systems founded in 1970 this should not be confused with dlrs institut für raumfahrtsysteme located in bremen also significant contributions are made to the european space organization


 research 

dlr’s mission comprises the exploration of the earth and the solar system as well as research aimed at protecting the environment and developing environmentally compatible technologies and at promoting mobility communication and security dlr’s research portfolio which covers the four focus areas aeronautics space transportation and energy ranges from basic research to innovative applications dlr operates large-scale research centres both for the benefit of its own projects and as a service for its clients and partners from the worlds of business and science
the objective of dlr’s aeronautics research is to strengthen the competitive advantage of the national and european aeronautical industry and aviation sector and to meet political and social demands – for instance with regard to climate-friendly aviation german space research activities range from experiments under conditions of weightlessness to the exploration of other planets and environmental monitoring from space in addition to these activities dlr performs tasks of public authority pertaining to the planning and implementation of the german space programme in its capacity as the official space agency of the federal republic of germany dlr’s project management agency german projektträger im dlr has also been entrusted with tasks of public authority pertaining to the administration of subsidies in the field of energy research dlr is working on highly efficient low-co2 power generation technologies based on gas turbines and fuel cells on solar thermal power generation and on the efficient use of heat including cogeneration based on fossil and renewable energy sources the topics covered by dlr’s transportation research are maintaining mobility protecting the environment and saving resources and improving transportation safety
in addition to the already existing projects mars express global navigation satellite system galileo and shuttle radar topography mission the institute of space systems german institut für raumfahrtsysteme was founded in bremen on 26 january 2007 in the future 80 scientists and engineers will be doing research into topics such as space mission concepts satellite development and propulsion technology


 planetary research 


 mars express 

the high resolution stereo camera hrsc is the most important german contribution to the european space agency’s mars express mission it is the first digital stereo camera that also generates multispectral data and that has a very high resolution lens the camera records images of the martian surface which formed the basis for a large number of scientific studies with the hrsc which was developed at the german aerospace center’s institute of planetary research german institut für planetenforschung it is possible to analyse details no larger than 10 to 30 meters in three dimensions


 rosetta and philae 

the comet orbiter rosetta is controlled from the european space operations centre esoc in darmstadt germany the dlr has provided the structure thermal subsystem flywheel the active descent system procured by dlr but made in switzerland rolis downward-looking camera sesame acoustic sounding and seismic instrument for philae the orbiters landing unit it has also managed the project and did the level product assurance the university of münster built mupus it was designed and built in space research centre of polish academy of sciences  and the braunschweig university of technology the romap instrument the max planck institute for solar system research made the payload engineering eject mechanism landing gear anchoring harpoon central computer cosac apxs and other subsystems

the framing cameras provided by the max planck institute for solar system research and the dlr are the main imaging instruments of dawn a multi-destination space probe to the protoplanets 4 vesta and 1 ceres launched in 2007 the cameras offer resolutions of 17 mpixel for vesta and 66 mpixel for ceres because the framing cameras are vital for both science and navigation the payload has two identical and physically separate cameras fc1  fc2 for redundancy each with its own optics electronics and structure


 manned spaceflight 


 columbus 

dlr operates the columbus control center in oberpfaffenhofen germany it is responsible for the coordination of scientific activities as well as for systems operations and life support on board the orbiting columbus laboratory
in february 2008 the columbus laboratory europe’s core contribution to the international space station iss was brought into space by the space shuttle and docked to the iss the cylindrical module which has a diameter of 4.5 metres 14 ft 9 in contains state-of-the-art scientific equipment it is planned to enable researchers on earth to conduct thousands of experiments in biology materials science fluid physics and many other fields under conditions of weightlessness in space


 spacelab shuttle mir soyuz 
germany has near ten astronauts and participates in esa manned space programs including flights of german astronauts aboard us space shuttles and russian spacecraft besides missions under esa and flights on soyuz and mir two space shuttle missions with the european built spacelab were fully funded and organizationally and scientifically controlled by germany like a separate few by esa and one by japan with german astronauts on board as hosts and not guests the first west german mission deutschland 1 spacelab-d1 dlr-1 nasa designation sts-61-a took place in 1985 
the second similar mission deutschland 2 spacelab-d2 dlr-2 nasa designation sts-55 was first planned for 1988 but then due to the space shuttle challenger disaster was delayed until 1993 when it became the first german manned space mission after german reunification


 earth-bound research and aeronautics 


 remote sensing of the earth 
in remote sensing of the earth satellites provide comprehensive and continually updated information on system earth this remote sensing data is used to investigate the earth’s atmosphere land and ocean surfaces and ice sheets practical applications of this technology include environmental monitoring and disaster relief
following the indian ocean tsunami of 26 december 2004 for instance up-to-date maps could be compiled very quickly using earth observation satellites these maps could then be used for orientation during relief missions dlr conducts these research activities at the german remote sensing data center dfd german deutsches fernerkundungsdatenzentrum a dlr institute based in oberpfaffenhofen nowadays satellite data is also important for climate research it is used to measure temperatures co2 levels particulate matter levels rainforest deforestation and the radiation conditions of the earth’s surface land oceans polar ice


 terrasar-x 
the new german earth observation satellite terrasar-x was launched in june 2007 the objective of this five-year mission is to provide radar remote sensing data to scientific and commercial users the satellite’s design is based on the technology and expertise developed in the x-sar and srtm sar missions synthetic aperture radar the sensor has a number of different modes of operation with a maximum resolution of one meter and is capable of generating elevation profiles
terrasar-x is the first satellite that was jointly paid for by government and industry dlr contributed about 80 percent of the total expenses with the remainder being covered by eads astrium the satellites core component is a radar sensor operating in the x band and capable of recording the earth’s surface using a range of different modes of operation capturing an area of 10 to 100 kilometers in size with  a resolution of 1 to 16 meters


 astronomical surveys 
the uppsala-dlr trojan survey udts was a search for asteroids near jupiter in the 1990s in collaboration with the swedish uppsala astronomical observatory when it concluded there was another survey the uao-dlr asteroid survey this time with a focus on near earth asteroids and both surveys discovered numerous objects


 suborbital spaceplane 
studying a suborbital spaceplane dlr conducted falke prototype for hermes spaceplane program participates in non-realized sanger ii project and since 2005 work under the concept making fast intercontinental passenger transport possible the spaceliner is a reusable vehicle lifting-off vertically and landing like a glider


 research aircraft 

dlr operates europe’s largest fleet of research aircraft the aircraft are used both as research objects and as research tools dlr’s research aircraft provide platforms for all kinds of research missions scientists and engineers can use them for practical application-oriented purposes earth observation atmospheric research or testing new aircraft components dlr is for instance investigating wing flutter and possible ways of eliminating it which would also help to reduce aircraft noise so-called flying simulators can be used to simulate the flight performance of aircraft that have not been built yet this method was for instance used to test the airbus a380 in the early stages of its development the vfw 614 attas was used to test several systemsthe high-altitude research aircraft halo high altitude and long range research aircraft will be used for atmospheric research and earth observation from 2009 with a cruising altitude of more than 15 kilometers and a range of over 8,000 kilometers halo will provide for the first time the capability to gather data on a continental scale at all latitudes from the tropics to the poles and at altitudes as high as the lower stratosphere
the airbus a320-232 d-atra the latest and largest addition to the fleet has been in use by the german aerospace center since late 2008 atra advanced technology research aircraft is a modern and flexible flight test platform which sets a new benchmark for flying test beds in european aerospace research – and not just because of its size
dlr and nasa jointly operate the flying infrared telescope sofia stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy a boeing 747sp with a modified fuselage enabling it to carry a reflecting telescope developed in germany is used as an airborne research platform the aircraft is operated by the dryden flight research center at site 9 usaf plant 42 in palmdale california observation flights will be flown 3 or 4 nights a week for up to eight hours at a time and at an altitude of 12 to 14 kilometers sofia has been designed to remain operational for a period of 20 years it is the successor to the kuiper airborne observatory kao which was deployed from 1974 to 1995


 emissions research 

dlr conducts research into co2 and noise emissions caused by air transport in order to ensure that increasing traffic volumes do not lead to an increase in the noise pollution caused by air transport dlr is investigating options for noise reduction the low-noise approach and departure procedures research project german lärmoptimierte an- und abflugverfahren for instance forms part of the national research project quiet traffic german leiser verkehr the objective of this project is to find flight procedures that can reduce the amount of noise generated during takeoff and landing one approach is to analyse noise propagation at ground level during takeoff using a large number of microphones researchers are also trying to reduce the noise at source focusing for instance on airframe and engine noise they hope to minimise noise generated in the engines using so-called antinoise
the german aerospace centers research work on co2 emissions caused by air transport focuses for instance on model calculations concerning the effects of converting the global aircraft fleet to hydrogen propulsion the growth rates of aviation are above average this raises the question if co2 emission-free hydrogen propulsion could perhaps limit the effects of growing air traffic volumes on the environment and the climate


 hydrogen as an energy carrier 
the hydrosol and hydrosol-2 is one of the energy research projects in which dlr scientists are engaged for the first time scientists have achieved thermal water splitting using solar energy generating hydrogen and oxygen without co2 emissions for this achievement the dlr team and several other research groups received the descartes prize a research award created by the european commission  the fp6 hydrosol ii pilot reactor around 100 kw for solar thermochemical hydrogen production at the plataforma solar de almería in spain started in november 2005 and is in operation since 2008


 traffic congestion 

during the 2006 fifa world cup football championship dlr implemented the soccer project aimed at preventing traffic congestion in this transportation research project traffic data was obtained from the air in berlin stuttgart and cologne and used as input for traffic forecasting a sensor system combining a conventional and a thermographic camera was used to obtain the data a zeppelin an aeroplane and a helicopter served as flying research platforms an image analysis software package generated aerial photos showing the current traffic parameters as well as traffic forecasts in this way traffic control centres could be provided with almost-real-time traffic information and road users could be diverted whenever necessary


 solar tower power plant 

in 2007 the first commercially operated solar tower power plant the ps10 solar power tower was commissioned it has a capacity of eleven megawatt and it is located near sevilla in sanlúcar la mayor spain dlr is prominently involved in developing the technology for this type of power plant in solar tower power plants sun-tracking mirrors heliostats redirect the solar radiation onto a central heat exchanger receiver on top of a tower this generates high-temperature process heat which can then be used in gas or steam turbine power plants to generate electrical power for the public electricity grid in the future solar thermal tower plant technology could also be used to generate solar fuels such as hydrogen without co2 emissions
