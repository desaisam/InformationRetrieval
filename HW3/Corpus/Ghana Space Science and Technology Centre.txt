the ghana space science and technology centre gsstc was opened officially on 2 may 2012 as ghana’s first space science space exploration astronomy and technology space agency gsstc and ghana space agency ghsa aims to become an arena of excellence in space science space exploration and space technology through teaching learning private spaceflight and space research commercialisation the centre and space agency will also allow scientists and astronauts to conduct research into natural resource management weather forecasting agriculture and national security


 history 
the ghana space science and technology institute gssti was first established as a centre under the school of nuclear and allied sciences snas in january 2011 and launched in may 2012 it was later upgraded to an institute in august 2013 to exploit space science and technology for socio-economic development of the country


 operations 
the gsstc space agencys first flagship project is the ghana radio astronomy project which will see the abandoned vodafone earth satellite station at kuntunse near accra turned into a radio astronomy telescope in 2012 work was conducted by ghanaian experts of the gsstc and south african experts of the south african national space agency to replace worn out partsthe gsstc is working with the china national space administration to engage with astronauts students and young professionals about collaboration with the centre and space agency and it has already embarked on outreach programmes to schools and has run tours to scientific sites


 technicity 
between the years of 2012 and 2024 ghana is reportedly seeking usd5-10 billion in finance and funding support to develop the centre’s infrastructure and human capacity it has approached a global consortium of multinational institutions - including the china development bank and the bank hsbc – as well as requesting technical advice from the china national space administration and nasa for space science exploration and institutions in japan japan aerospace exploration agency and india indian space research organisationthe agency is planning to complete its first satellite by 2020 in 2015 the government allocated 10 million to research nuclear and space science technology the goal of the funding is to increase outreach and work towards earth imaging satellites so they do not have to purchase imagery from other countries as of 2016 there are 20 employees working at the institute a major driver of earth monitoring satellites is to curtail the increase in illegal mining which has a negative effect on the environment
