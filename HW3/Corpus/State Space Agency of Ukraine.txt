the state space agency of ukraine ssau ukrainian державне космічне агентство україни derzhavne kosmichne ahentstvo ukrayiny дкау dkau is the ukrainian government agency responsible for space policy and programs along with the ukrainian defense industry and the antonov aeronautical scientific-technical complex it is a major state complex of the national defense industry of ukraine the state space agency of ukraine does not specialize in manned astronautical programs it is the second of two direct soviet space program descendants the agency does not have its own spaceport and is often dependent on the resources of the russian federal space agency the primary inheritor of the soviet space program
until december 9 2010 the agency was known as національне космічне агентство україни нкау the national space agency of ukraine  nsauuntil 2014 launches were conducted at kazakhstans baikonur and russias plesetsk cosmodromes after the crimean crisis launches were conducted on sea launchs floating platform which was soon mothballed nsau has ground control and tracking facilities in kiev and a control center in dunaivtsi khmelnytskyi oblast other facilities in yevpatoria crimea were abandoned after the annexation
ukrainian spacecraft include a few kinds for domestic and foreign use and international cooperation ukraine has supplied russia with military satellites and their launch vehicles a unique relationship in the world


 main tasks 
development of state policy concepts in the sphere of research and peaceful uses of space as well as in the interests of national security
organization and development of space activities in ukraine and under its jurisdiction abroad
contributing to state national security and defense capability
organization and development of ukraine’s cooperation with other states and international space organizationsnsau is a civil body in charge of co-ordinating the efforts of government installations research and industrial companies mostly state-owned several space-related institutes and industries are directly subordinated to nsau however it is not a united and centralized system immediately participating in all stages and details of space programs like nasa in the united states a special space force in the military of ukraine is also absent
the agency oversees launch vehicle and satellite programs co-operative programs with the russian aviation and space agency the european space agency nasa and commercial ventures international participation includes sea launch and the galileo positioning system


 space program 

space activities in ukraine have been pursued over a 10-year span in strict accordance with national space programs each of them was intended to address the relevant current issues to preserve and further develop the space potential of ukraine
the first program 1993–1997 was called upon to keep up the research and industrial space-related potentiality for the benefit of the national economy and state security as well as to be able to break into the international market of space services the second program 1998–2002 was aimed at creating an internal market of space services conquering the international space markets by presenting in-house products and services including launch complexes and spacecraft space-acquired data space system components and integrating ukraine into the worldwide space community
the national space program of ukraine for 2003-2007 nspu which was adopted by the verkhovna rada of ukraine the parliament of ukraine on october 24 2002 outlines the main goals assignments priorities and methods of maintaining space activity in ukraine
the ukrainian cabinet of ministers announced its plans on 13 april 2007 to allocate 312 million euros to the national space program for 2007-2011
specific programs

scientific space research
remote sensing of the earth
satellite telecommunication systems
development of ground-based infrastructure for navigation and special information system
space activities in the interests of national security and defense
space complexes
development of base elements and advanced space technologies
development of research test and production base of the space sectorgoals of the program

to develop a national system for earth observation from outer space to meet the national demands in the social economic sphere and for security and defense purposes
to introduce satellite systems and communication facilities into the telecommunication infrastructure of the state
to obtain new fundamental knowledge on near-earth outer space the solar system deep space biological and physical processes and the microgravity condition
to create and develop techniques for space access with a view toward realizing national and international projects and to enable the home-made rocket to be employed on the worldwide market of space transportation services
to elaborate the advanced space facilities
to ensure the innovative development of the space sector in terms of improving its research experimental and production basis


 history 

the agency is a minor descendant of the soviet space program that was passed mostly to the russian federal space agency the agency took over all the former soviet defense industrial complex that was located on the territory of ukraine the space industry of ukraine started in 1937 when a group of scientists led by heorhiy proskura launched a large stratospheric rocket near kharkiv
in 1954 the soviet government transformed the car producer yuzhmash dnipropetrovsk into a rocket company since that time the city of dnipropetrovsk has been known in the anglophone world as the soviet rocket city
ukraine officially became the tenth space power on august 31 1995 with the launch of sich-1 using a tsyklon-3as of april 2009 the ukrainian national space agency is planning to launch a ukrainian communications satellite by september 2011 and a sich-2 before the end of 2011

 launch capabilities 

during 1991-2007 a total of 97 launches of ukrainian lv were conducted including but not limited to launches on the sea launch mobile launch pad in 2006 ukrainian launch vehicles accounted for 12% of all launches into space in the world

ukrainian companies yuzhnoye design office and yuzhmash have engineered and produced seven types of launch vehicles adding strapon boosters to launch vehicles may expand the family of mayak which is the latest launch vehicle developed

 svityaz project 

the svityaz oril and sura aerospace rocket complexes asrc is intended for launching of various spacecraft sc into circular elliptic and high-altitude circular including the geostationary gso orbits svityaz asc represents a unique system that allows launch of spacecraft without utilization of complicated ground infrastructure the svityaz is launched directly from a modified version of an-225 mriya a ukrainian airplane and airplane carrier that is currently the largest one in the world modified mriya that will be used to carry svityaz has been designated a code of an-225-100
the aircraft is equipped with special devices to secure the lv above the fuselage the operators and onboard equipment are located in the pressure-tight cabins the svityaz lv is being created on the basis of units aggregates and systems of zenit lv it consists of three stages of non-toxic propellants — liquid oxygen and kerosene the launch vehicle is injected into the geostationary orbit using a solid-propellant apogee stage


 sea launch project 
see more detailed article at sea launchsea launch is joint venture space transportation company partially owned by companies in ukraine  which handle operations for the national space agency  sea launch offers a mobile sea platform used for spacecraft launches of commercial payloads on specialized ukrainian zenit 3sl rockets the main advantage of the floating cosmodrome is its placement directly on the equator it allows taking the greatest advantage of earths rotation to deliver payloads into orbit at low expense
within the framework of the project the space rocket complex was developed which consists of four components

marine segment

spacecraft segment and
facilitiessea launch mothballed its ships and put operations on long-term hiatus in 2014


 satellite programs 
ukraine produced the sich and okean earth observation satellites as well as a few other types of satellites and the coronas solar observatory in cooperation with russia

sich-1 1995-2001
okean since 1999
