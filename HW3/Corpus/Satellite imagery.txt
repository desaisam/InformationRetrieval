satellite imagery also earth observation imagery or spaceborne photography are images of earth or other planets collected by imaging satellites operated by governments and businesses around the world satellite imaging companies sell images by licensing them to governments and businesses such as apple maps and google maps


 history 

the first images from space were taken on sub-orbital flights the us-launched v-2 flight on october 24 1946 took one image every 1.5 seconds with an apogee of 65 miles 105 km these photos were from five times higher than the previous record the 13.7 miles 22 km by the explorer ii balloon mission in 1935 the first satellite orbital photographs of earth were made on august 14 1959 by the us explorer 6 the first satellite photographs of the moon might have been made on october 6 1959 by the soviet satellite luna 3 on a mission to photograph the far side of the moon the blue marble photograph was taken from space in 1972 and has become very popular in the media and among the public also in 1972 the united states started the landsat program the largest program for acquisition of imagery of earth from space landsat data continuity mission the most recent landsat satellite was launched on 11 february 2013 in 1977 the first real time satellite imagery was acquired by the united statess kh-11 satellite system

all satellite images produced by nasa are published by nasa earth observatory and are freely available to the public several other countries have satellite imaging programs and a collaborative european effort launched the ers and envisat satellites carrying various sensors there are also private companies that provide commercial satellite imagery in the early 21st century satellite imagery became widely available when affordable easy to use software with access to satellite imagery databases was offered by several companies and organizations


 uses 

satellite images have many applications in meteorology oceanography fishing agriculture biodiversity conservation forestry landscape geology cartography regional planning education intelligence and warfare images can be in visible colors and in other spectra there are also elevation maps usually made by radar images interpretation and analysis of satellite imagery is conducted using specialized remote sensing software


 data characteristics 
there are four types of resolution when discussing satellite imagery in remote sensing  spatial spectral temporal and radiometric  campbell 2002 defines these as follows

spatial resolution is defined as the pixel size of an image representing the size of the surface area ie m2 being measured on the ground determined by the sensors instantaneous field of view ifov
spectral resolution is defined by the wavelength interval size discrete segment of the electromagnetic spectrum and number of intervals that the sensor is measuring
temporal resolution is defined by the amount of time eg days that passes between imagery collection periods for a given surface location
radiometric resolution is defined as the ability of an imaging system to record many levels of brightness contrast for example and to the effective bit-depth of the sensor number of grayscale levels and is typically expressed as 8-bit 0-255 11-bit 0-2047 12-bit 0-4095 or 16-bit 0-65,535
geometric resolution refers to the satellite sensors ability to effectively image a portion of the earths surface in a single pixel and is typically expressed in terms of ground sample distance or gsd gsd is a term containing the overall optical and systemic noise sources and is useful for comparing how well one sensor can see an object on the ground within a single pixel for example the gsd of landsat is ≈30m which means the smallest unit that maps to a single pixel within an image is ≈30m x 30m the latest commercial satellite geoeye 1 has a gsd of 0.41 m this compares to a 0.3 m resolution obtained by some early military film based reconnaissance satellite such as coronathe resolution of satellite images varies depending on the instrument used and the altitude of the satellites orbit for example the landsat archive offers repeated imagery at 30 meter resolution for the planet but most of it has not been processed from the raw data landsat 7 has an average return period of 16 days for many smaller areas images with resolution as high as 41 cm can be availablesatellite imagery is sometimes supplemented with aerial photography which has higher resolution but is more expensive per square meter satellite imagery can be combined with vector or raster data in a gis provided that the imagery has been spatially rectified so that it will properly align with other data sets


 imaging satellites 


 public domain 
satellite imaging of the earth surface is of sufficient public utility that many countries maintain satellite imaging programs the united states has led the way in making these data freely available for scientific use some of the more popular programs are listed below recently followed by the european unions sentinel constellation


 landsat 
landsat is the oldest continuous earth observing satellite imaging program optical landsat imagery has been collected at 30 m resolution since the early 1980s beginning with landsat 5 thermal infrared imagery was also collected at coarser spatial resolution than the optical data the landsat 7 and landsat 8 satellites are currently in orbit landsat 9 is planned

the 3 spot satellites in orbit spot 2 4 and 5 provide images with a large choice of resolutions – from 2.5 m to 1 km spot image also distributes multiresolution data from other optical satellites in particular from formosat-2 taiwan and kompsat-2 south korea and from radar satellites terrasar-x ers envisat radarsat spot image is also the exclusive distributor of data from the high resolution pleiades satellites with a resolution of 0.50 meter or about 20 inches the launches occurred in 2011 and 2012 respectively the company also offers infrastructures for receiving and processing as well as added value options


 blackbridge 
blackbridge previously known as rapideye operates a constellation of five satellites launched in august 2008 the rapideye constellation contains identical multispectral  sensors which are equally calibrated therefore an image from one satellite will be equivalent to an image from any of the other four allowing for a large amount of imagery to be collected 4 million km² per day and daily revisit to an area each travel on the same orbital plane at 630 km and deliver images in 5 meter pixel size rapideye satellite imagery is especially suited for agricultural environmental cartographic and disaster management applications the company not only offers their imagery but consults their customers to create services and solutions based on analysis of this imagery 


 imagesat international 
earth resource observation satellites better known as “eros” satellites are lightweight low earth orbiting high-resolution satellites designed for fast maneuvering between imaging targets in the commercial high-resolution satellite market eros is the smallest very high resolution satellite it is very agile and thus enables very high performances the satellites are deployed in a circular sun-synchronous near polar orbit at an altitude of 510 km - 40 km
eros satellites imagery applications are primarily for intelligence homeland security and national development purposes but also employed in a wide range of civilian applications including mapping border control infrastructure planning agricultural monitoring environmental monitoring disaster response training and simulations etc
eros a – a high resolution satellite with 1.9-1.2m resolution panchromatic was launched on december 5 2000
eros b - the second generation of very high resolution satellites with 70 cm resolution panchromatic was launched on april 25 2006


 imagery analysis using artificial intelligence 
advancements in artificial intelligence have made autonomous large scale analysis of imagery possible ai has been taught to process satellite imagery with a small degree of error studies have used ai to differentiate between different forest types and ai can tell the difference between certain soil and vegetation types researchers are using ai to monitor satellite imagery for vineyard and grape health as well as having ai estimate wheat harvest size projects like spaceknow uses ai to conduct case studies in near real-time of deforestation due to wildfires in california and manufacturing activity in chinaas the technology advances clearer imagery and faster neural networks has allowed for the study of above ground biomass agb this abg index can describe the size and density of vegetation which scientists use to estimate carbon output and footprints in certain areas scientists are eager to apply this data to the study of global warming and climate change researchers are developing ai that can monitor refugee movements in war-torn countries monitor deforestation in the amazon rain-forest and show algae blooms in places like the gulf of mexico and the red sea upcoming studies of contaminated surface water and chemical runoff from fracking are also being planned


 disadvantages 
because the total area of the land on earth is so large and because resolution is relatively high satellite databases are huge and image processing creating useful images from the raw data is time-consuming depending on the sensor used weather conditions can affect image quality for example it is difficult to obtain images for areas of frequent cloud cover such as mountain-tops  for such reasons publicly available satellite image datasets are typically processed for visual or scientific commercial use by third parties
commercial satellite companies do not place their imagery into the public domain and do not sell their imagery instead one must be licensed to use their imagery thus the ability to legally make derivative products from commercial satellite imagery is minimized
privacy concerns have been brought up by some who wish not to have their property shown from above google maps responds to such concerns in their faq with the following statement we understand your privacy concerns the images that google maps displays are no different from what can be seen by anyone who flies over or drives by a specific geographic location
