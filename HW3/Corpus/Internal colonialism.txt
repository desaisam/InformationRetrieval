internal colonialism is the uneven effects of economic development on a regional basis otherwise known as uneven development as a result of the exploitation of minority groups within a wider society and leading to political and economic inequalities between regions within a state this is held to be similar to the relationship between metropole and colony in colonialism proper the phenomenon creates a distinct separation of the dominant core from the periphery in an empirerobert blauner is regarded as the developer of the internal colonialism theory the term was coined to highlight the blurred lines between geographically close locations that are clearly different in terms of culture some other factors that separate the core from the periphery are language religion physical appearance types and levels of technology and sexual behaviour the cultural and integrative nature of internal colonialism is understood as a project of modernity and has been explored by robert peckham in relation to the formation of a national modern greek culture during the nineteenth century when greece gained independence from the ottoman empirethe main difference between neocolonialism and internal colonialism is the source of exploitation in the former the control comes from outside the nation-state while in the latter it comes from within 


 origin of the concept 
the first known use of the concept of internal colonialism was by marquard 1957 regarding south africa however the concept became popularized following the publication of an article on mexico by gonzález casanova 1965 gonzalez casanova was both critiqued by and influenced andre gunder frank who further theorised internal colonialism as a form of uneven development sergio salvi a poet essayist and historian of minority languages used the term internal colonies in the cultural sense in le nazioni proibite guida a dieci colonie interne delleuropa occidentale the forbidden nations guide to ten internal colonies of western europe 1973 among which he included catalonia scotland brittany and occitania other pivotal works on the subject were published during the mid-1970s by harold wolpe and michael hechter adolf hitler mentions the concept of internal colonization in his book mein kampf of 1925 chapter 4 as a wrong way of tackling the problems that come with the increase of population of a nation he states that the limitation to a definite small area of soil inherent in internal colonization leads to an exceedingly unfavorable politicomilitary situation in the nation in question


 examples

 afghanistan 
afghanistan is an example of internal colonialism affecting state-building as m nazif sharani argues the incessantly centralizing state policies and practices of internal colonialism generally aided and abetted by old colonialist powers produced a cumulatively negative impact on state-building efforts in afghanistan the international security scholar dipali mukhopadhya considers the presence of warlordism in the afghan periphery to be a concern for the development of the political economy with the 2007 world bank report highlighting weak institutional links between provincial offices and relationships with the central government poorly defined


 algeria 
one of the exceptions of internal colonialism as the subsistence of blurred lines between the core and periphery is french algeria there were clearly distinct features separating the core from the periphery the core was christian french-speaking light-skinned and comparatively prosperous the other side was muslim arabic berber-speaking and significantly poorer the grey section of french algeria was the large jewish population which did not belong in either the core or periphery in terms of common cultural factors

 philippines 

in the philippines non-manilans have often expressed that the affairs of the country—whether political economic but most importantly cultural including linguistic—are imposed from the manilan core on the peripheral rest of the country due to tagalist nationalism this has been articulated in a cebuano saying which goes walay dahong mahulog sa atong nasod nga dili mananghid sa malakanyang translated as not a leaf may fall in our country without malacañangs permission it is also ominous that certain personalities have called for the political isolation overthrow and outright assassination of those who are opposed to the current core–periphery relationship


 sri lanka

international dimensions of the ethnic conflict in sri lanka prof john p neelsen tuebingen university germany 20th european conference on modern south asian studies 8–11 july 2008 a shortcoming in international law as to internal colonialism and the right to self-determination renders the current types of international intervention not just inadequate to contribute to a negotiated solution of ethnic conflicts but tends to inflame them

proceedings of the conference on tamils in new zealand july 1996 - wellington new zealand

fourth world colonialism indigenous minorities and tamil separatism in sri lanka bryan pfaffenberger virginia university bulletin of concerned asian scholars vol 16 1984
despite the withdrawal of colonial power from third world countries forms of oppression that might well be termed colonial still persist in many of them — the oppression wrought by nationalist third world governments whose regimes fail to respect the rights of indigenous minorities for ethnic and regional minorities in many third world countries the arrogance and injustice of these governments matches — and often exceeds — those of the departed european colonial regime the island nation sri lanka presents a case in point little public investment appears to reach the tamil lands…
