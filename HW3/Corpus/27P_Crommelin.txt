comet crommelin also known as comet pons-coggia-winnecke-forbes is a periodic comet with an orbital period of almost 28 years it fits the classical definition of a halley-type comet with 20 years  period  200 years it is named after the british astronomer andrew c d crommelin who calculated its orbit in 1930 it is one of only four comets not named after their discoverers the other three being comets halley encke and lexell
the first observation was by jean-louis pons marseille france on february 23 1818 he followed the comet until february 27 but was prevented further by bad weather johann franz encke attempted to calculate the orbit but was left with very large errors
in 1872 john r hind produced a rough orbital calculation and observed it was close to that of comet biela based on these observations edmund weiss later speculated it may have been part of bielas comet
the next observation was on november 10 1873 by jérôme e coggia marseille france and again on november 11 by friedrich a t winnecke strasbourg france but it was lost by november 16 weiss and hind took up the calculations and tried to match it again with the 1818 appearance
a third discovery was by alexander f i forbes cape town south africa on november 19 1928 and confirmed by harry e wood union observatory south africa on november 21 it was crommelin who eventually established the orbit and finally linked the 1818 pons and 1873 coggia-winnecke comets to it also see lost comet
on its latest return 27pcrommelin was recovered on may 12 2011 at apparent magnitude 18.7 and peaked at magnitude 10.7 at perihelion on august 3
