pioneer 6 7 8 and 9 were space probes in the pioneer program they were a series of solar-orbiting spin-stabilized solar-cell and battery-powered satellites designed to obtain measurements on a continuing basis of interplanetary phenomena from widely separated points in space they were also known as pioneer a b c and d the fifth pioneer e was lost in a launch accident


 purpose 
pioneers 6 7 8 and 9 were created to make the first detailed comprehensive measurements of the solar wind solar magnetic field and cosmic rays they were designed to measure large scale magnetic phenomena and particles and fields in interplanetary space data from the vehicles has been used to better understand stellar processes and the structure and flow of the solar wind the vehicles also acted as the worlds first space-based solar weather network providing practical data on solar storms which impact communications and power on earth
the experiments studied the positive ions cations and electrons in the solar wind the interplanetary electron density radio propagation experiment solar and galactic cosmic rays and the interplanetary magnetic fieldthe spacecraft were important collectors heliophysics and space weather data in conjunction with other spacecraft these for the first time enabled spaceborne observations to be combined with terrestrial observations on the ground and from sounding balloons pioneer 9 in early august 1972 recorded significant observations of one of the most potent solar storms ever recorded and the most hazardous to human spaceflight during the space age


 vehicle description 
each craft was identical with an on-orbit dry mass of 146 kg they were spin-stabilized 0.94 m diameter × 0.81 m tall cylinders with a 1.8 m long magnetometer boom and solar panels mounted around the body
the main antenna was a high-gain directional antenna the spacecraft were spin-stabilized at about 60 rpm and the spin axis was perpendicular to the ecliptic plane and pointed toward the south ecliptic poleinstruments


 communications 
by ground command one of five bit rates one of four data formats and one of four operating modes could be selected the five bit rates were 512 256 64 16 and 8 bits three of the four data formats contained primarily scientific data and consisted of 32 seven-bit words per frame one scientific data format was for use at the two highest bit rates another was for use at the three lowest bit rates the third contained data from only the radio propagation experiment the fourth data format contained mainly engineering datathe four operating modes were real time telemetry store duty cycle store and memory readout in the real-time mode data were sampled and transmitted directly without storage as specified by the data format and bit rate selected in the telemetry store mode data were stored and transmitted simultaneously in the format and at the bit rate selected in the duty-cycle store mode a single frame of scientific data was collected and stored at a rate of 512 bits the time interval between the collection and storage of successive frames could be varied by ground command between 2 and 17 min to provide partial data coverage for periods up to 19 hours as limited by the bit storage capacity in the memory readout mode data was read out at whatever bit rate was appropriate to the satellite distance from earth


 time line and current status 
as stated by jpl the pioneer 6–9 program has been touted as one of the least expensive of all nasa spacecraft programs in terms of scientific results per dollar spent although the spacecraft have not been regularly tracked for science data return in recent years a successful telemetry contact with pioneer 6 was made on december 8 2000 to celebrate 35 years of continuous operation since launch its original design life expectancy was only 6 months
although nasa described pioneer 6 as extant as of  26 march 2007 there has been no contact since december 8 2000 at this time pioneer 6 had operated for 12,758 days making it the oldest operating space probe until it was surpassed by voyager 2 on august 13 2012 it is also believed that contact is still possible with pioneer 7 and 8 only pioneer 9 is definitely not working


 pioneer 6 
december 16 1965
launched at 073100 utc from cape canaveral to a circular solar orbit with a mean distance of 0.8 au
december 1995
the prime traveling-wave tube twt failed some time after december 1995
july 1996
spacecraft commanded to the backup twt
october 6 1997
tracked with the 70 meter deep space station 43 in australia
the mit and arc plasma analyzers as well as the cosmic ray detector from university of chicago were turned on and working
december 8 2000
successful telemetry contact for about two hours


 pioneer 7 
august 17 1966
launched from cape canaveral into solar orbit with a mean distance of 1.1 au
march 20 1986  
flew within 12.3 million kilometers of halleys comet and monitored the interaction between the cometary hydrogen tail and the solar wind it discovered he plasma produced by charge exchange of solar wind he with neutral cometary materialmarch 31 1995
tracked successfully the spacecraft and one of the science instruments were still functioning


 pioneer 8 
december 13 1967
launched at 140800 utc from cape canaveral into solar orbit with a mean distance of 1.1 au from the sun
august 22 1996
the spacecraft commanded to switch to the backup twt downlink signal was re-acquired one of the science instruments again functioning


 pioneer 9 
november 8 1968
launched at 094600 utc from cape canaveral into solar orbit with a mean distance of 0.8 au
1983 final contact
1987 contact was attempted but failed


 pioneer e 
august 27 1969
launched at 215900 utc from cape canaveral the launch vehicle was destroyed by range safety after hydraulics in the first stage failed
