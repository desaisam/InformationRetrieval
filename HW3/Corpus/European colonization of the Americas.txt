the european colonization of the americas describes the history of the settlement and establishment of control of the continents of the americas by most of the naval powers of western europe

systematic european colonization began in 1492 when a spanish expedition headed by the italian explorer christopher columbus sailed west to find a new trade route to the far east but inadvertently landed in what came to be known to europeans as the new world he ran aground on the northern part of hispaniola on 5 december 1492 which the taino people had inhabited since the 9th century the site became the first permanent european settlement in the americas western european conquest large-scale exploration and colonization soon followed columbuss first two voyages 1492–93 reached the bahamas and various caribbean islands including hispaniola puerto rico and cuba in 1497 italian explorer john cabot on behalf of england landed on the north american coast and a year later columbuss third voyage reached the south american coast as the sponsor of christopher columbuss voyages spain was the first european power to settle and colonize the largest areas from north america and the caribbean to the southern tip of south america
the spaniards began building their american empire in the caribbean using islands such as cuba puerto rico and hispaniola as bases the north and south american mainland fell to the conquistadors with an estimated 8,000,000 deaths of indigenous populations which has been argued to be the first large-scale act of genocide in the modern era florida fell to juan ponce de león after 1513 from 1519 to 1521 hernán cortés waged a campaign against the aztec empire ruled by moctezuma ii the aztec capital tenochtitlan became mexico city the chief city of what the spanish were now calling new spain more than 240,000 aztecs died during the siege of tenochtitlan of these 100,000 died in combat between 500 and 1,000 of the spaniards engaged in the conquest died later the areas that are today california arizona new mexico colorado texas missouri louisiana and alabama were taken over by other conquistadors such as hernando de soto francisco vázquez de coronado and álvar núñez cabeza de vaca farther to the south francisco pizarro conquered the inca empire during the 1530s the de soto expedition was the first major encounter of europeans with north american indians in the eastern half of the united states the expedition journeyed from florida through present-day georgia and the carolinas then west across the mississippi and into texas de soto fought his biggest battle at the walled town of mabila in present-day alabama on october 18 1540 spanish losses were 22 killed and 148 wounded the spaniards claimed that 2,500 indians died if true mabila was the bloodiest battle ever fought between red men and white in the present-day united states the centuries of continuous conflicts between the north american indians and the anglo-americans were secondary to the devastation wrought on the densely populated meso-american andean and caribbean heartlandsother powers such as france also founded colonies in the americas in eastern north america a number of caribbean islands and small coastal parts of south america portugal colonized brazil tried colonizing the eastern coasts of present-day canada and settled for extended periods northwest on the east bank of the river plate the age of exploration was the beginning of territorial expansion for several european countries europe had been preoccupied with internal wars and was slowly recovering from the loss of population caused by the black death thus the rapid rate at which it grew in wealth and power was unforeseeable in the early 15th centuryeventually most of the western hemisphere came under the control of western european governments leading to changes to its landscape population and plant and animal life in the 19th century over 50 million people left western europe for the americas the post-1492 era is known as the period of the columbian exchange a dramatically widespread exchange of animals plants culture human populations including slaves ideas and communicable disease between the american and afro-eurasian hemispheres following columbuss voyages to the americas
henry f dobyns estimates that immediately before european colonization of the americas there were between 90 and 112 million people in the americas a larger population than europe at the same time 


 norse trans-oceanic contact 

norse journeys to greenland and canada are supported by historical and archaeological evidence a norse colony in greenland was established in the late 10th century and lasted until the mid 15th century with court and parliament assemblies þing taking place at brattahlíð and a bishop located at garðar the remains of a norse settlement at lanse aux meadows in newfoundland canada were discovered in 1960 and were dated to around the year 1000 carbon dating estimate 990–1050 ce lanse aux meadows is the only site widely accepted as evidence of pre-columbian trans-oceanic contact it was named a world heritage site by unesco in 1978 it is also notable for its possible connection with the attempted colony of vinland established by leif erikson around the same period or more broadly with the norse colonization of the americas


 early conquests claims and colonies 

early explorations and conquests were made by the spanish and the portuguese immediately following their own final reconquest of iberia in 1492 in the 1494 treaty of tordesillas ratified by the pope these two kingdoms divided the entire non-european world into two areas of exploration and colonization with a north to south boundary that cut through the atlantic ocean and the eastern part of present-day brazil based on this treaty and on early claims by spanish explorer vasco núñez de balboa discoverer of the pacific ocean in 1513 the spanish conquered large territories in north central and south america

spanish conquistador hernán cortés took over the aztec kingdom and francisco pizarro conquered the inca empire as a result by the mid-16th century the spanish crown had gained control of much of western south america and southern north america in addition to its earlier caribbean territories over this same timeframe portugal claimed lands in north america canada and colonized much of eastern south america naming it santa cruz and brazil

other european nations soon disputed the terms of the treaty of tordesillas england and france attempted to plant colonies in the americas in the 16th century but these failed england and france succeeded in establishing permanent colonies in the following century along with the dutch republic some of these were on caribbean islands which had often already been conquered by the spanish or depopulated by disease while others were in eastern north america which had not been colonized by spain north of florida
early european possessions in north america included spanish florida spanish new mexico the english colonies of virginia with its north atlantic offshoot bermuda and new england the french colonies of acadia and canada the swedish colony of new sweden and the dutch new netherland in the 18th century denmark–norway revived its former colonies in greenland while the russian empire gained a foothold in alaska denmark-norway would later make several claims in the caribbean starting in the 1600s
as more nations gained an interest in the colonization of the americas competition for territory became increasingly fierce colonists often faced the threat of attacks from neighboring colonies as well as from indigenous tribes and pirates


 early state-sponsored colonists 

the first phase of well-financed european activity in the americas began with the atlantic ocean crossings of christopher columbus 1492–1504 sponsored by spain whose original attempt was to find a new route to india and china known as the indies he was followed by other explorers such as john cabot who was sponsored by england and reached newfoundland pedro álvares cabral reached brazil and claimed it for portugal
amerigo vespucci working for portugal in voyages from 1497 to 1513 established that columbus had reached a new set of continents cartographers still use a latinized version of his first name america for the two continents other explorers included giovanni da verrazzano sponsored by france in 1524 the portuguese joão vaz corte-real in newfoundland joão fernandes lavrador gaspar and miguel corte-real and joão álvares fagundes in newfoundland greenland labrador and nova scotia from 1498 to 1502 and in 1520 jacques cartier 1491–1557 henry hudson 1560s–1611 and samuel de champlain 1567–1635 who explored the region of canada he reestablished as new france
in 1513 vasco núñez de balboa crossed the isthmus of panama and led the first european expedition to see the pacific ocean from the west coast of the new world in an action with enduring historical import balboa claimed the pacific ocean and all the lands adjoining it for the spanish crown it was 1517 before another expedition from cuba visited central america landing on the coast of yucatán in search of slaves

these explorations were followed notably in the case of spain by a phase of conquest the spaniards having just finished the reconquista of spain from muslim rule were the first to colonize the americas applying the same model of governing their european holdings to their territories of the new world
ten years after columbuss discovery the administration of hispaniola was given to nicolás de ovando of the order of alcántara founded during the reconquista as in the iberian peninsula the inhabitants of hispaniola were given new landmasters while religious orders handled the local administration progressively the encomienda system which granted tribute access to indigenous labor and taxation to european settlers was set in place
a relatively common misconception is that a small number of conquistadores conquered vast territories aided only by disease epidemics and their powerful caballeros in fact recent archaeological excavations have suggested a vast spanish-indian alliance numbering in the hundreds of thousands hernán cortés eventually conquered mexico with the help of tlaxcala in 1519–1521 while the conquest of the incas was supported by some 40,000 incan renegades led by francisco pizarro in between 1532 and 1535
over the 1st century and a half after columbuss voyages the native population of the americas plummeted by an estimated 80% from around 50 million in 1492 to eight million in 1650 mostly by outbreaks of old world diseases
in 1532 charles v holy roman emperor sent a vice-king to mexico antonio de mendoza in order to prevent cortes independentist drives who definitively returned to spain in 1540 two years later charles v signed the new laws which replaced the laws of burgos of 1512 prohibiting slavery and the repartimientos but also claiming as his own all the american lands and all of the indigenous people as his own subjects

when pope alexander vi issued the inter caetera bull in may 1493 granting the new lands to the kingdom of spain he requested in exchange an evangelization of the people thus during columbuss second voyage benedictine monks accompanied him along with twelve other priests as slavery was prohibited between christians and could only be imposed in non-christian prisoners of war or on men already sold as slaves the debate on christianization was particularly acute during the 16th century in 1537 the papal bull sublimis deus definitively recognized that native americans possessed souls thus prohibiting their enslavement without putting an end to the debate some claimed that a native who had rebelled and then been captured could be enslaved nonetheless
later the valladolid debate between the dominican priest bartolomé de las casas and another dominican philosopher juan ginés de sepúlveda was held with the former arguing that native americans were beings doted with souls as all other human beings while the latter argued to the contrary and justified their enslavement
the process of christianization was at first violent when the first franciscans arrived in mexico in 1524 they burned the places dedicated to pagan cult alienating much of the local population in the 1530s they began to adapt christian practices to local customs including the building of new churches on the sites of ancient places of worship leading to a mix of old world christianity with local religions the spanish roman catholic church needing the natives labor and cooperation evangelized in quechua nahuatl guaraní and other native american languages contributing to the expansion of these indigenous languages and equipping some of them with writing systems one of the first primitive schools for native americans was founded by fray pedro de gante in 1523
to reward their troops the conquistadores often allotted indian towns to their troops and officers black african slaves were introduced to substitute for native american labor in some locations—including the west indies where the indigenous population was nearing extinction on many islands
during this time the portuguese gradually switched from an initial plan of establishing trading posts to extensive colonization of what is now brazil they imported millions of slaves to run their plantations the portuguese and spanish royal governments expected to rule these settlements and collect at least 20% of all treasure found the quinto real collected by the casa de contratación in addition to collecting all the taxes they could by the late 16th century american silver accounted for one-fifth of spains total budget in the 16th century perhaps 240,000 europeans entered american ports


 the search for riches 

inspired by the spanish riches from colonies founded upon the conquest of the aztecs incas and other large native american populations in the 16th century the first englishmen to settle permanently in america hoped for some of the same rich discoveries when they established their first permanent settlement in jamestown virginia in 1607 they were sponsored by common stock companies such as the chartered virginia company financed by wealthy englishmen who exaggerated the economic potential of this new land the main purpose of this colony was the hope of finding goldit took strong leaders like john smith to convince the colonists of jamestown that searching for gold was not taking care of their immediate needs for food and shelter and the biblical principle that he who will not work shall not eat see 2 thessalonians 3 the lack of food security leading to extremely high mortality rate was quite distressing and cause for despair among the colonists to support the colony numerous supply missions were organized tobacco later became a cash crop with the work of john rolfe and others for export and the sustaining economic driver of virginia and the neighboring colony of maryland
from the beginning of virginias settlements in 1587 until the 1680s the main source of labor and a large portion of the immigrants were indentured servants looking for new life in the overseas colonies during the 17th century indentured servants constituted three-quarters of all european immigrants to the chesapeake region most of the indentured servants were teenagers from england with poor economic prospects at home their fathers signed the papers that gave them free passage to america and an unpaid job until they became of age they were given food clothing housing and taught farming or household skills american landowners were in need of laborers and were willing to pay for a laborer’s passage to america if they served them for several years by selling passage for five to seven years worth of work they could then start on their own in america many of the migrants from england died in the first few yearseconomic advantage also prompted the darien scheme an ill-fated venture by the kingdom of scotland to settle the isthmus of panama in the late 1690s the darien scheme aimed to control trade through that part of the world and thereby promote scotland into a world trading power however it was doomed by poor planning short provisions weak leadership lack of demand for trade goods and devastating disease the failure of the darien scheme was one of the factors that led the kingdom of scotland into the act of union 1707 with the kingdom of england creating the united kingdom of great britain and giving scotland commercial access to english now british coloniesin the french colonial regions the focus of economy was on sugar plantations in caribbean in canada the fur trade with the natives was important about 16,000 french men and women became colonizers the great majority became subsistence farmers along the st lawrence river with a favorable disease environment and plenty of land and food their numbers grew exponentially to 65,000 by 1760 their colony was taken over by britain in 1760 but social religious legal cultural and economic changes were few in a society that clung tightly to its recently formed traditions


 religious immigration 

roman catholics were the first major religious group to immigrate to the new world as settlers in the colonies of portugal and spain and later france belonged to that faith english and dutch colonies on the other hand tended to be more religiously diverse settlers to these colonies included anglicans dutch calvinists english puritans and other nonconformists english catholics scottish presbyterians french huguenots german and swedish lutherans as well as jews quakers mennonites amish and moraviansmany groups of colonists went to the americas searching for the right to practice their religion without persecution the protestant reformation of the 16th century broke the unity of western christendom and led to the formation of numerous new religious sects which often faced persecution by governmental authorities in england many people came to question the organization of the church of england by the end of the 16th century one of the primary manifestations of this was the puritan movement which sought to purify the existing church of england of its offensive residual catholic rites
waves of repression led to the migration of about 20,000 puritans to new england between 1629 and 1642 where they founded multiple colonies later in the century the new pennsylvania colony was given to william penn in settlement of a debt the king owed his father its government was established by william penn in about 1682 to become primarily a refuge for persecuted english quakers but others were welcomed baptists german and swiss protestants and anabaptists also flocked to pennsylvania the lure of cheap land religious freedom and the right to improve themselves with their own hand was very attractive


 forced immigration and enslavement 

slavery was a common practice in the americas prior to the arrival of europeans as different american indian groups captured and held other tribes members as slaves many of these captives were forced to undergo human sacrifice in amerindian civilizations such as the aztecs in response to some enslavement of natives in the caribbean during the early years the spanish crown passed a series of laws prohibiting slavery as early as 1512 a new stricter set of laws was passed in 1542 called the new laws of the indies for the good treatment and preservation of indians or simply new laws these were created to prevent the exploitation of the indigenous peoples by the encomenderos or landowners by strictly limiting their power and dominion this helped curb indian slavery considerably though not completely later with the arrival of other european colonial powers in the new world the enslavement of native populations increased as these empires lacked legislation against slavery until decades later the population of indigenous peoples declined mostly from european diseases but also from forced exploitation and atrocities later native workers were replaced by africans imported through a large commercial slave trade
by the 18th century the overwhelming number of black slaves was such that amerindian slavery was less commonly used africans who were taken aboard slave ships to the americas were primarily obtained from their african homelands by coastal tribes who captured and sold them europeans traded for slaves with the slave capturers of the local native african tribes in exchange for rum guns gunpowder and other manufactures


 slavery 

the total slave trade to islands in the caribbean brazil mexico and to the united states is estimated to have involved 12 million africans the vast majority of these slaves went to sugar colonies in the caribbean and to brazil where life expectancy was short and the numbers had to be continually replenished at most about 600,000 african slaves were imported into the united states or 5% of the 12 million slaves brought across from africa life expectancy was much higher in the united states because of better food less disease lighter work loads and better medical care so the numbers grew rapidly by excesses of births over deaths reaching 4 million by the 1860 census slaves were a valuable commodity both for work and for sale in slave markets and so the policy of actively encouraging or forcing slaves to breed developed especially after the ending of the atlantic slave trade from 1770 until 1860 the rate of growth of north american slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in europe and was nearly twice as rapid as that of englandslaves imported to the thirteen coloniesunited states by time period

 disease and indigenous population loss 

the european lifestyle included a long history of sharing close quarters with domesticated animals such as cows pigs sheep goats horses dogs and various domesticated fowl from which many diseases originally stemmed thus in contrast to the indigenous people europeans had developed a richer endowment of antibodies the large-scale contact with europeans after 1492 introduced eurasian germs to the indigenous people of the americas
epidemics of smallpox 1518 1521 1525 1558 1589 typhus 1546 influenza 1558 diphtheria 1614 and measles 1618 swept the americas subsequent to european contact killing between 10 million and 100 million people up to 95% of the indigenous population of the americas the cultural and political instability attending these losses appears to have been of substantial aid in the efforts of various colonists in new england and massachusetts to acquire control over the great wealth in land and resources of which indigenous societies had customarily made usesuch diseases yielded human mortality of an unquestionably enormous gravity and scale – and this has profoundly confused efforts to determine its full extent with any true precision estimates of the pre-columbian population of the americas vary tremendously
others have argued that significant variations in population size over pre-columbian history are reason to view higher-end estimates with caution such estimates may reflect historical population maxima while indigenous populations may have been at a level somewhat below these maxima or in a moment of decline in the period just prior to contact with europeans indigenous populations hit their ultimate lows in most areas of the americas in the early 20th century in a number of cases growth has returnedaccording to scientists from university college london the colonization of the americas by europeans killed so much of the indigenous population that it resulted in climate change and global cooling


 impact of colonial land ownership on long-term development 
geographic differences between the colonies played a large determinant in the types of political and economic systems that later developed in their paper on institutions and long-run growth economists daron acemoglu simon johnson and james a robinson argue that certain natural endowments gave rise to distinct colonial policies promoting either smallholder or coerced labor production densely settled populations for example were more easily exploitable and profitable as slave labor in these regions landowning elites were economically incentivized to develop forced labor arrangements such as the peru mita system or argentinian latifundias without regard for democratic norms french and british colonial leaders conversely were incentivized to develop capitalist markets property rights and democratic institutions in response to natural environments that supported smallholder production over forced labor
james mahoney a professor at northwestern university proposes that colonial policy choices made at critical junctures regarding land ownership in coffee-rich central america fostered enduring path dependent institutions coffee economies in guatemala and el salvador for example were centralized around large plantations that operated under coercive labor systems by the 19th century their political structures were largely authoritarian and militarized in colombia and costa rica conversely liberal reforms were enacted at critical junctures to expand commercial agriculture and they ultimately raised the bargaining power of the middle class both nations eventually developed more democratic and egalitarian institutions than their highly concentrated landowning counterparts
