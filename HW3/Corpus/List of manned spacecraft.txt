 comparison 


 current crewed spacecraft 


 soyuz 1967–present

 spaceshiptwo 2018-present 
united states 8 person air-launched suborbital space plane operated by virgin galactic aimed at the space tourism market on 31 october 2014 during a test flight vss enterprise the first spaceshiptwo craft broke up in flight and crashed in the mojave desert one pilot was killed the second spaceshiptwo spacecraft vss unity was unveiled on 19 february 2016 on 13 december 2018 spaceshiptwo flew to an alttude of 82.7 km which is recognised as space by the faa nasa and the usaf although not the fai this was the first time an american spacecraft had sent astronauts to space since the final shuttle flight in 2011
vss unity flew to space again on 22 february 2019 to an apogee of 89.9 km 55.97 miles onboard was astronaut dave mackay michael masucci and beth moses this again met the united states definition of space though not the fais despite this because it is a us spaceflight launched from the united states to its definition of space it is indeed a spaceflight
