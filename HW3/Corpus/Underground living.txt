underground living refers to living below the grounds surface whether in naturally occurring caves or in built structures underground dwellings are an alternative to above-ground dwellings for some home seekers including those who are looking to minimize impact on the environment factories and office buildings can benefit from underground facilities for many of the same reasons as underground dwellings such as noise abatement energy use and security
some advantages of underground houses include resistance to severe weather quiet living space an unobtrusive presence in the surrounding landscape and a nearly constant interior temperature due to the natural insulating properties of the surrounding earth one appeal is the energy efficiency and environmental friendliness of underground dwellings however underground living does have certain disadvantages such as the potential for flooding which in some cases may require special pumping systems to be installed
it is the preferred mode of housing to communities in such extreme environments as italys sassi di matera australias coober pedy berber caves as those in matmâta tunisia and even amundsen–scott south pole station
often underground living structures are not entirely underground typically they can be exposed on one side when built into a hill this exposure can significantly improve interior lighting although at the expense of greater exposure to the elements


 history 
there is only written documentation of scythian and german subterranean dwellings remnants have been found in switzerland mecklenburg and southern bavaria they had a round shape with a kettle-like widening at the bottom from eleven to fifteen metres in diameter and from two to four metres in depth


 construction methods 
in parts of rural australia subterranean houses are built in a manner similar to prairie dog holes there is a chimney placed higher than ground-level and a lower ground-level entrance this orientation causes a continuous breeze throughout the house reducing or eliminating the need for air conditioning


 structures 
there are various ways to develop structures for underground living

caves natural have been used for millennia as shelter
caves constructeddugouts are a common structure for underground living  although the tunnelling techniques required to make them have been well developed by the mining industry they can be considerably more costly and dangerous to make than some of the alternatives  on the plus side they can be quite deep  some examples would be the sassi di matera in italy declared by unesco a world heritage site and the town of coober pedy in australia built underground to avoid the blistering heat of the outback one of the traditional house types in china is the yaodong a cave house also see the nok and mamproug cave dwellings in togo africa
earth berm structures are essentially traditional homes that have then been buried typically leaving at least one wall exposed for lighting and ventilation  however because they are to be buried the structures must be made of materials capable of surviving the increased weight and moisture of being underground
rammed earth structures are not truly underground in the sense of being below grade or buried beneath a berm instead they are structures made of tightly packed earth similar to concrete but without the binding properties of cement these structures share many properties with traditional adobe construction
culvert structures are a very simple approach  large precast concrete pipes and boxes a few metres across are assembled into the desired arrangement of rooms and hallways onsite either atop the existing ground or below grade in excavated trenches then buried  this approach can also be referred to as cut and cover
urban underground living is so common that few even think of it as underground  many shopping malls are partially or totally underground in the sense that they are below grade  though not as exotic as the other underground structures those working in such urban underground structures are in fact living underground
shaft structures for example taisei corporation proposed to build alice city in tokyo japan the project would incorporate a very wide and deep shaft within which would be built levels for habitation all looking in toward a hollow core topped with a huge skylight
tunnels including storm drains are used by homeless people as shelter in large cities


 in fiction 
underground living has been a feature of fiction such as the hobbit holes of the shire as described in the stories of j r r tolkien and the underground city by jules verne some films are almost entirely set underground such as thx 1138 the fallout series also has underground shelters called vaults
the majority of the short science-fiction story the machine stops by british author em forster is set in an imagined underground city
