nemesis is a hypothetical red dwarf or brown dwarf originally postulated in 1984  to be orbiting the sun at a distance of about 95,000 au 1.5 light-years somewhat beyond the oort cloud to explain a perceived cycle of mass extinctions in the geological record which seem to occur more often at intervals of 26 million years as of  2012 more than 1800 brown dwarfs have been identified there are actually fewer brown dwarfs in our cosmic neighborhood than previously thought rather than one star for every brown dwarf there may be as many as six stars for every brown dwarf the majority of solar-type stars are single the previous idea stated half or perhaps most stellar systems were binary trinary or multiple-star systems associated with clusters of stars rather than the single-star systems that tend to be seen most often in a 2017 paper sarah sadavoy and steven stahler argued that the sun was likely part of a binary system at the time of its formation leading them to suggest there probably was a nemesis a long time ago” such a star would have separated from this binary system over four billion years ago meaning it could not be responsible for the more recent perceived cycle of mass extinctions douglas vakoch told business insider adding that if the sun really was part of a binary star system in its early days its early twin deserves a benign name like companion rather than the threatening nemesismore recent theories suggest that other forces like close passage of other stars or the angular effect of the galactic gravity plane working against the outer solar orbital plane may be the cause of orbital perturbations of some outer solar system objects in 2011 coryn bailer-jones analyzed craters on the surface of the earth and reached the conclusion that the earlier findings of simple periodic patterns implying periodic comet showers dislodged by a hypothetical nemesis star were statistical artifacts and found that the crater record shows no evidence for nemesis however in 2010 al melott and rk bambach found evidence in the fossil record confirming the extinction event periodicity originally claimed by raup  sepkoski in 1984 but at a higher confidence level and over a time period nearly twice as long the infrared astronomical satellite iras failed to discover nemesis in the 1980s the 2mass astronomical survey which ran from 1997 to 2001 failed to detect an additional star or brown dwarf in the solar systemusing newer and more powerful infrared telescope technology which is able to detect brown dwarfs as cool as 150 kelvins out to a distance of 10 light-years from the sun the wide-field infrared survey explorer wise survey has not detected nemesis in 2011 david morrison a senior scientist at nasa known for his work in risk assessment of near earth objects has written that there is no confidence in the existence of an object like nemesis since it should have been detected in infrared sky surveys


 claimed periodicity of mass extinctions 
in 1984 paleontologists david raup and jack sepkoski published a paper claiming that they had identified a statistical periodicity in extinction rates over the last 250 million years using various forms of time series analysis they focused on the extinction intensity of fossil families of marine vertebrates invertebrates and protozoans identifying 12 extinction events over the time period in question the average time interval between extinction events was determined as 26 million years at the time two of the identified extinction events cretaceous–paleogene and eocene–oligocene could be shown to coincide with large impact events although raup and sepkoski could not identify the cause of their supposed periodicity they suggested a possible non-terrestrial connection the challenge to propose a mechanism was quickly addressed by several teams of astronomersin 2010 melott  bambach re-examined the fossil data including the now-improved dating and using a second independent database in addition to that raup  sepkoski had used they found evidence for a signal showing an excess extinction rate with a 27-million-year periodicity now going back 500 million years and at a much higher statistical significance than in the older work they also determined that this periodicity is inconsistent with the nemesis hypothesis the change from 26 to 27 million years is expected based on a 3% stretch in the geological timescale since the 1980s


 development of the nemesis hypotheses 
two teams of astronomers daniel p whitmire and albert a jackson iv and marc davis piet hut and richard a muller independently published similar hypotheses to explain raup and sepkoskis extinction periodicity in the same issue of the journal nature this hypothesis proposes that the sun may have an undetected companion star in a highly elliptical orbit that periodically disturbs comets in the oort cloud causing a large increase of the number of comets visiting the inner solar system with a consequential increase of impact events on earth this became known as the nemesis or death star hypothesis
if it does exist the exact nature of nemesis is uncertain muller suggests that the most likely object is a red dwarf with an apparent magnitude between 7 and 12 while daniel p whitmire and albert a jackson argue for a brown dwarf if a red dwarf it would exist in star catalogs but it would only be confirmed by measuring its parallax due to orbiting the sun it would have a low proper motion and would escape detection by older proper motion surveys that have found stars like the 9th-magnitude barnards star the proper motion of barnards star was detected in 1916 muller expects nemesis to be discovered by the time parallax surveys reach the 10th magnitudemuller referring to the date of a recent extinction at 11 million years before the present day posits that nemesis has a semi-major axis of about 1.5 light-years 95,000 au and suggests it is located supported by yarris 1987 near hydra based on a hypothetical orbit derived from original aphelions of a number of atypical long-period comets that describe an orbital arc meeting the specifications of mullers hypothesis richard mullers most recent paper relevant to the nemesis theory was published in 2002 in 2002 muller speculated that nemesis was perturbed 400 million years ago by a passing star from a circular orbit into an orbit with an eccentricity of 0.7


 orbit of sedna 

the trans-neptunian object sedna has an extra-long and unusual elliptical orbit around the sun ranging between 76 and 937 au sednas orbit is estimated to last between 10.5 and 12 thousand years its discoverer michael brown of caltech noted in a discover magazine article that sednas location seemed to defy reasoning sedna shouldnt be there brown said theres no way to put sedna where it is it never comes close enough to be affected by the sun but it never goes far enough away from the sun to be affected by other stars brown therefore postulated that a massive unseen object may be responsible for sednas anomalous orbit this line of inquiry eventually led to the hypothesis of planet nine
brown has stated that it is more likely that one or more non-companion stars passing near the sun billions of years ago could have pulled sedna out into its current orbit in 2004 kenyon forwarded this explanation after analysis of sednas orbital data and computer modeling of possible ancient non-companion star passes


 past current and pending searches for nemesis 
searches for nemesis in the infrared are important because cooler stars comparatively shine more brightly in infrared light the university of californias leuschner observatory failed to discover nemesis by 1986  the infrared astronomical satellite iras failed to discover nemesis in the 1980s the 2mass astronomical survey which ran from 1997 to 2001 failed to detect a star or brown dwarf in the solar system if nemesis exists it may be detected by pan-starrs or the planned lsst astronomical surveys
in particular if nemesis is a red dwarf or a brown dwarf the wise mission an infrared sky survey that covered most of our solar neighborhood in movement-verifying parallax measurements was expected to be able to find it wise can detect 150-kelvin brown dwarfs out to 10 light-years but the closer a brown dwarf is the easier it is to detect preliminary results of the wise survey were released on april 14 2011 on march 14 2012 the entire catalog of the wise mission was released in 2014 wise data ruled out a saturn or larger-sized body in the oort cloud out to ten thousand aucalculations in the 1980s suggested that a nemesis object would have an irregular orbit due to  perturbations from the galaxy and passing stars the melott  bambach work shows an extremely regular signal inconsistent with the expected irregularities in such an orbit thus while supporting the extinction periodicity it appears to be inconsistent with the nemesis hypothesis though of course not inconsistent with other kinds of substellar objects according to a 2011 nasa news release recent scientific analysis no longer supports the idea that extinctions on earth happen at regular repeating intervals and thus the nemesis hypothesis is no longer needed
