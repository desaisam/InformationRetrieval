118401 linear provisional designation 1999 re70 is an asteroid and main-belt comet 176plinear that was discovered by the lincoln near-earth asteroid research linear 1-metre telescopes in socorro new mexico on september 7 1999 118401 linear was discovered to be cometary on november 26 2005 by henry h hsieh and david c jewitt as part of the hawaii trails project using the gemini north 8-m telescope on mauna kea and was confirmed by the university of hawaiis 2.2-m 88-in telescope on december 24–27 2005 and gemini on december 29 2005 observations using the spitzer space telescope have resulted in an estimate of 4.0±0.4 km for the diameter of 118401 linearthe main-belt comets are unique in that they have flat within the plane of the planets orbits approximately circular small eccentricity asteroid-like orbits and not the elongated often tilted orbits characteristic of all other comets because 118401 linear can generate a coma produced by vapour boiled off the comet it must be an icy asteroid when a typical comet approaches the sun its ice heats up and sublimates changes directly from ice to gas venting gas and dust into space creating a tail and giving the object a fuzzy appearance far from the sun sublimation stops and the remaining ice stays frozen until the comets next pass close to the sun in contrast objects in the asteroid belt have essentially circular orbits and are expected to be mostly baked dry of ice by their confinement to the inner solar system see extinct comet
it is suggested that these main-belt asteroid-comets are evidence of a recent impact exposing an icy interior to solar radiation a good question is how long will current main-belt comets keep generating a coma it is estimated short-period comets remain active for about 10,000 years before having most of their ice sublimated away and going dormant
seven other objects are classified as both periodic comets and numbered asteroids 2060 chiron 95pchiron 4015 wilson–harrington 107pwilson–harrington 7968 elst–pizarro 133pelst–pizarro 60558 echeclus 174pecheclus 323137 2003 bm80 282p2003 bm80 300163 2006 vw139 288p2006 vw139 and 457175 2008 go98 362p2008 go98 as a dual-status object astrometric observations of 118401 linear should be reported under the minor planet designation118401 linear last came to perihelion on 2017 march 12
