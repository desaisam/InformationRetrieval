uncontacted peoples also referred to as isolated people or lost tribes are communities who live or have lived either by choice people living in voluntary isolation or by circumstance without significant or first contact with greater civilization few people have remained totally uncontacted by modern civilization
indigenous rights activists call for such groups to be left alone stating that contact will interfere with their right to self-determination in addition isolated tribes may lack immunity to common diseases which can kill a large percentage of their people after contactin 2013 it was estimated that there were more than 100 uncontacted tribes around the world mostly in the densely forested areas of south america and new guinea the sentinelese andaman islands india are the most secluded tribe in the world knowledge of the existence of these groups comes mostly from infrequent and sometimes violent encounters with neighbouring tribes and from aerial footage
uncontacted tribes are a source of fascination in contacted society and the idea of tour operators offering extreme adventure tours to specifically search out uncontacted people has become controversial


 asia 


 india 
the sentinelese people of north sentinel island which lies near south andaman island in the bay of bengal reject contact attempts to contact them have usually been rebuffed sometimes with lethal force their language is markedly different from other languages on the andamans which suggests that they have remained uncontacted for thousands of years they have been called by experts the most isolated people in the world and they are likely to remain so during the 2001 census of india a joint expedition  conducted during 23–24 february 2001 identified at least a few dozen individuals but it was not exhaustive helicopter surveys after the 2004 indian ocean tsunami confirmed the sentinelese survived and there have been a few limited interactions with them since the local andaman and nicobar administration has adopted an eyes-on and hands-off policy to ensure that no poachers enter the island a protocol of circumnavigation of north sentinel island has been made and notified in consultation with the indian governmentanother andamanese tribe the jarawas live on the main islands largely isolated from other peoples they are thought to number a few hundred people


 philippines 
in 1971 it was announced that an uncontacted tribe the tasaday people had been discovered living a stone age lifestyle on the philippine island of mindanao the tasaday a group of 27 people comprising six families were reported to have had no contact with outsiders for 1000 years however subsequent investigations in the 1980s raised questions as to whether their status as an uncontacted people was an exaggeration or even an elaborate hoax some anthropologists believe that the tasaday had been isolated for no more than 150 years not 1000 years as originally claimed


 oceania 


 australia 

in 1984 a group of pintupi people who were living a traditional hunter-gatherer life were tracked down in the gibson desert in western australia for the first time they encountered people from western society they are believed to have been the last uncontacted tribe in australia


 new guinea 
large areas of new guinea are unexplored by scientists and anthropologists due to extensive forestation and mountainous terrain
the indonesian provinces of papua and west papua on the island of new guinea are home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups  isolated tribes have been reported also in the eastern indonesian islands
the uncontacted tribes are located in the regions of gusawi lengguru kokiri derewo teriku foja manu waruta and brazza-digulin 1971 the bbc made a documentary a blank on the map hosted by david attenborough in which the first contact was made with the biami people of new guinea a bbc four documentary in 2006 documented a controversial american tour operator who specialised in escorted tours to discover uncontacted people in west papua


 north america 
it is believed that the last group of uncontacted native peoples in north america were the lacandón people contacted in the early part of the 20th century both ishis yahi family and the lacandón maya were aware of european colonisation and the civilization that had developed from it but purposefully avoided any direct contact preferring to interact only with other native peoples


 united states 
ishi a member of the  yahi tribe is believed to have been the last native american in the us to have lived most of his life completely outside the culture of the united states in 1911 aged around 50 he emerged from the wild near oroville california leaving his ancestral homeland in the foothills near lassen peak


 mexico 
the last group of people to make contact within the environs of mexico were the lacandon people thought to be a formerly urban maya population that had retreated into the lacandon jungle of the yucatán peninsula to flee spanish colonisation the lacandon who call themselves hachwinik have been completely secluded from society since the 17th century initial contact was established in 1924 though it would be a number of decades before they fully emerged major deforestation in 1993 caused the population of the lacandon people to drop significantly as of 1996 they numbered around 500 people


 south america 


 bolivia

 colombia 
due to ongoing conflict colombia is a country that offers little protection for isolated groups carabayo-aroje is the one such group living in the parque nacional del rio pure it is not known whether any yari another tribe believed to be uncontacted survives now nukaak maku were contacted in 2003 and 65% of the tribal members died of disease around two or three dozen nukaak still remain isolated


 ecuador 
it is not known whether any tagaeri survive now in yasuni national park in the 1990s when a member of the tagaeri was contacted by a lone huaorani hunter he told him that the tagaeri numbered only a handful of members and are in danger of being wiped out by their hostile neighbours – the taromenane since then there have been no more peaceful contacts the tagaeri hunter also mentioned another group the oñamenane who numbered five or six individuals and one other tribe – the huiñatare in 2003 about 30 taromenane were massacred by the huaorani in retaliation for the killing of a huaorani hunter in the same year 14 tagaeri were killed by loggers in april 2006 a logger was speared to death by the taromenane in 2005 another one was also killed by the same tribe whose body was later found embedded with 30 spears and his face unrecognisable in the same month a further 30 taromenane and 10 loggers were killed in conflicts according to leader iki ima omene of huaorani in january 2007 the president of ecuador declared the southern part of yasuni a forbidden zone 7,580 square kilometers in order to protect the uncontacted people at the same time conaie reported that there were a total of 150–300 taromenane divided into two sub-tribes and 20–30 tagaeri surviving uncontacted there the oñamenane and huiñatare are extinct 

the uncontacted bands or nuclear families belonging to the taromenane and tagaeiri tribes were located in and around the tributaries of the rumiyaku tiputini and curaray rivers esp along the tivacuno yasuni nashiño cononaco cononaco chico tiwino and cuchiyaku rivulets the major bands identified in 2013 were
cuchiyaku band
located in the south-western side of the forbidden zone along the rio curaray this particular band has been almost exterminated by frequent conflict with the babeiri group of the christianised huaorani indigenous organisations have accused the oil companies of bribing the baeiri in order to exterminate the uncontacted indians in a major massacre in 2003 more than 15 uncontacted indians were massacred with shotguns and hunting rifles
tivacuno band of yasuní
the band is located entirely inside the forbidden zone which was set up for their protection the ethnic identity is believed to be tagaeiri led by an elder known as nankamo this group speaks the huaorani language clashes between the uncontacted indians and the christianised ones have not been reported for the past many years
chico cononaco band
located along the tiwino road this group have been heavily decimated due to armed conflicts it is believed that this band is composed of taromenane men and tagaeiri womenthe conflicts occurring in this region are not new phenomena the conflict started as early as the 1970s when oil companies recruited kichwa indians for their drilling and exploration work to maintain the law and order the ecuadorian government asked the sil missionaries to resettle the huaorani to regions away from the oil blocks in return the missionaries were supported by the oil companies who provided them with helicopters and other articles most of the huaorani relocated 90% by 1975 but the remaining free bands soon took over the vacant lands a part of the territory which was formerly occupied by the extinct sápara tribe was also conquered
on 24 march 2013 more than 20 uncontacted taromenane indians were killed by contactedsettled indians who were armed with shotguns and carbines in retaliation for a previous murder human rightsreligious activists miguel ángel cabodevilla and milagros aguirre authored a book called a tragedy hidden away detailing the massacre but the ecuadorian supreme court banned its distribution reversing the ban after two days due to public outcry the book was later released on the internet


 french guiana 
as of 2013 it is considered unlikely that there remains any uncontacted ethnic groups in french guiana


 guyana 
as of 2013 probably no uncontacted ethnic groups exist in guyana


 paraguay 
there remain perhaps as many as 300 totobiegosode who have not been contacted they belong to the ayoreo ethnicity which numbers around 2,000 in the 1990s the main group attempting to contact them was new tribes mission in 1979 and 1986 the new tribes mission was accused of assisting in the forcible contact of nomadic ayoreo indians whose unsuccessful attempts to remain in the forest led to several native deaths others died soon after being brought out of the forest the incident forced some ayoreo to flee to bolivia ranchers who illegally encroach on their lands are a threat to these people in 2004 a group of 17 ayoreo-totobiegosode previously uncontacted made contact with the outside world and decided to settle down five men seven women and five children according to survival international it was not known whether there were any more isolated ayoreo left in the jungle in the first week of september 2007 another uncontacted band of ayoreo-totobiegosode were spotted by loggers in the western chaco ayoreo are believed to be the last uncontacted indians south of the amazon basin in 2008 a paraguayan ruling blocked a brazilian company from clearing totobiegosode to make room for cattle ranches although the forest is still being cleared illegally


 peru 
there are five reserves in the peruvian amazon meant to protect the lands and rights of isolated peoples most of the reserves are entered by illegal loggers and petroleum companies with legal concessions to work in those lands although their activities jeopardise the lives of the isolated populationsafter brazil 67 uncontacted groups confirmed and new guinea papua new guinea and iriyan jaya peru has one of the largest number of uncontacted tribes in the world 15 some of the groups in peru are in danger of extermination by loggers and oil development as of 2006 the locations where uncontacted groups are confirmed to be living are as follows

divided into at least 3 different bands one band lives in rio purus basin in south ucayali while two more were reported from the rio las piedras basin esp rio tahuamanu and the rio los amigos region a fourth band whose existence is not confirmed is reported from alto rio yurua north of rio purus each band is believed to be divided into small nomadic subdivisions the mashco-piro are the remnants of a much larger tribe which was destroyed during the rubber boom in the 1960s two of the bands were attacked using dynamite and other explosives by workers from the international petroleum company attacks after 1999 have been due mainly to the increasing prices of mahogany in 2002 a reserve was set up for some of the mashco-piro bands as of 2013 all the bands seem to be surviving between 2005 and 2013 miguel piovesan an italian christian missionary campaigned for a road from puerto esperanza to inapari which would cut through the mascho-piro reserve as a result of piovesans campaign which got good support from the non-indigenous poor population of the region whom the road was intended to help the government declared its intention to construct such a road advocate groups worry that this may push the tribe towards extinction
kugapakori and nahua bands of matsigenka
although most of the matsigenka are contacted some are still uncontacted the contacted matsigenka were forcibly resettled by the summer institute of linguistics in the 1950s the uncontacted bands are reported from alto rio paquiria in rio urubamba basin as of 2013 the attacks against the uncontacted bands has slowed down after government created tribal reserves

most of the uncontacted bands of ashaninka are located along the foothills of cordillera vilcabamba esp in rio ene basin population was estimated at 90 families in 2010 during the 1980 and 1990s hundreds of uncontacted ashaninka are believed to have died in the conflicts between government troops and left-wing guerillas as of 2013 the attacks against the indians has slowed down and their villages are located inside the otishi national park and the ashaninka communal reserve
isolados do rio yavari e rio tapiche mayoruna 
evidence suggests that this group speaks some of the panoan languages there are two distinct tribes with the one in the north related to the matses or northern mayoruna while the southern one related to isconahua or remo  southern mayoruna in 1964 the peruvian air force attacked some of the villages with napalm killing a large number of indians the tribes frequently criss-cross the brazil-peru border in 2010 the marubo living on the brazilian side of the border claimed that more and more mayoruna from peru are crossing over to brazil in order to escape from loggers and missionaries violent clashes has occurred recently between the contacted marubo and the uncontacted mayoruna missionaries from the summer institute of linguistics sil are currently attempting to contact the uncontacted bands
