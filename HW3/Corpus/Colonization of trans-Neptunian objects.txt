freeman dyson has proposed that trans-neptunian objects rather than planets are the major potential habitat of life in space several hundred billion to trillion comet-like ice-rich bodies exist outside the orbit of neptune in the kuiper belt and inner and outer oort cloud these may contain all the ingredients for life water ice ammonia and carbon-rich compounds including significant amounts of deuterium and helium-3 since dysons proposal the number of trans-neptunian objects known has increased greatly
colonists could live in the dwarf planets icy crust or mantle using fusion or geothermal heat and mining the soft-ice or liquid inner ocean for volatiles and minerals given the light gravity and resulting lower pressure in the ice mantle or inner ocean colonizing the rocky cores outer surface might give colonists the largest number of mineral and volatile resources as well as insulating them from cold surface habitats or domes are another possibility as background radiation levels are likely to be lowcolonists of such bodies could also build rotating habitats or live in dug-out spaces and light them with fusion reactors for thousands to millions of years before moving on dyson and carl sagan envisioned that humanity could migrate to neighbouring star systems which have similar clouds by using natural objects as slow interstellar vessels with substantial natural resources and that such interstellar colonies could also serve as way-stations for faster smaller interstellar ships alternatively richard terra has proposed using the materials from the oort-cloud objects to build vast starlight collecting arrays to power habitats thus making an oort-cloud community essentially independent of its central star and fusion fuel supplies
