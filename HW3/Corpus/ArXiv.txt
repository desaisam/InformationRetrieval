arxiv pronounced archive—the x represents the greek letter chi χ is a repository of electronic preprints known as e-prints approved for posting after moderation but not full peer review it consists of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics physics astronomy electrical engineering computer science quantitative biology statistics mathematical finance and economics which can be accessed online  in many fields of mathematics and physics almost all scientific papers are self-archived on the arxiv repository begun on august 14 1991 arxivorg passed the half-million-article milestone on october 3 2008 and had hit a million by the end of 2014  by october 2016 the submission rate had grown to more than 10,000 per month


 history 

arxiv was made possible by the low-bandwidth tex file format which allowed scientific papers to be easily transmitted over the internet and rendered client-side around 1990 joanne cohn began emailing physics preprints to colleagues as tex files but the number of papers being sent soon filled mailboxes to capacity paul ginsparg recognized the need for central storage and in august 1991 he created a central repository mailbox stored at the los alamos national laboratory which could be accessed from any computer additional modes of access were soon added ftp in 1991 gopher in 1992 and the world wide web in 1993 the term e-print was quickly adopted to describe the articles
it began as a physics archive called the lanl preprint archive but soon expanded to include astronomy mathematics computer science quantitative biology and most recently statistics its original domain name was xxxlanlgov due to lanls lack of interest in the rapidly expanding technology in 2001 ginsparg changed institutions to cornell university and changed the name of the repository to arxivorg it is now hosted principally by cornell with eight mirrors around the worldits existence was one of the precipitating factors that led to the current movement in scientific publishing known as open access mathematicians and scientists regularly upload their papers to arxivorg for worldwide access and sometimes for reviews before they are published in peer-reviewed journals ginsparg was awarded a macarthur fellowship in 2002 for his establishment of arxiv
the annual budget for arxiv is approximately 826,000 for 2013 to 2017 funded jointly by cornell university library the simons foundation in both gift and challenge grant forms and annual fee income from member institutions  this model arose in 2010 when cornell sought to broaden the financial funding of the project by asking institutions to make annual voluntary contributions based on the amount of download usage by each institution each member institution pledges a five-year funding commitment to support arxiv based on institutional usage ranking the annual fees are set in four tiers from 1,000 to 4,400 cornells goal is to raise at least 504,000 per year through membership fees generated by approximately 220 institutionsin september 2011 cornell university library took overall administrative and financial responsibility for arxivs operation and development  ginsparg was quoted in the chronicle of higher education as saying it was supposed to be a three-hour tour not a life sentence  however ginsparg remains on the arxiv scientific advisory board and on the arxiv physics advisory committee


 moderation process and endorsement 
although arxiv is not peer reviewed a collection of moderators for each area review the submissions they may recategorize any that are deemed off-topic or reject submissions that are not scientific papers or sometimes for undisclosed reasons the lists of moderators for many sections of arxiv are publicly available but moderators for most of the physics sections remain unlisted
additionally an endorsement system was introduced in 2004 as part of an effort to ensure content is relevant and of interest to current research in the specified disciplines  under the system for categories that use it an author must be endorsed by an established arxiv author before being allowed to submit papers to those categories endorsers are not asked to review the paper for errors but to check whether the paper is appropriate for the intended subject area new authors from recognized academic institutions generally receive automatic endorsement which in practice means that they do not need to deal with the endorsement system at all  however the endorsement system has attracted criticism for allegedly restricting scientific inquirya majority of the e-prints are also submitted to journals for publication but some work including some very influential papers remain purely as e-prints and are never published in a peer-reviewed journal  a well-known example of the latter is an outline of a proof of thurstons geometrization conjecture including the poincaré conjecture as a particular case uploaded by grigori perelman in november 2002 perelman appears content to forgo the traditional peer-reviewed journal process stating if anybody is interested in my way of solving the problem its all there on the arxiv – let them go and read about it despite this non-traditional method of publication other mathematicians recognized this work by offering the fields medal and clay mathematics millennium prizes to perelman both of which he refused


 submission formats 
papers can be submitted in any of several formats including latex and pdf printed from a word processor other than tex or latex the submission is rejected by the arxiv software if generating the final pdf file fails if any image file is too large or if the total size of the submission is too large  arxiv now allows one to store and modify an incomplete submission and only finalize the submission when ready the time stamp on the article is set when the submission is finalized


 access 
the standard access route is through the arxivorg website or one of several mirrors several other interfaces and access routes have also been created by other un-associated organisations these include the university of california daviss front a web portal that offers additional search functions and a more self-explanatory interface for arxivorg and is referred to by some mathematicians as the front a similar function used to be offered by eprintweborg launched in september 2006 by the institute of physics and was switched off on june 30 2014 carnegie mellon provides tablearxiv a search engine for tables extracted from arxiv publications  google scholar and microsoft academic can also be used to search for items in arxiv a full text and author search engine for arxiv is provided by scientillion finally researchers can select sub-fields and receive daily e-mailings or rss feeds of all submissions in them


 copyright status of files 
files on arxiv can have a number of different copyright statuses
some are public domain in which case they will have a statement saying so
some are available under either the creative commons 3.0 attribution-sharealike license or the creative commons 3.0 attribution-noncommercial-sharealike license
some are copyright to the publisher but the author has the right to distribute them and has given arxiv a non-exclusive irrevocable license to distribute them
most are copyright to the author and arxiv has only a non-exclusive irrevocable license to distribute them


 controversy 
while arxiv does contain some dubious e-prints such as those claiming to refute famous theorems or proving famous conjectures such as fermats last theorem using only high-school mathematics they are surprisingly rare  arxiv generally re-classifies these works eg in general mathematics rather than deleting them however some authors have voiced concern over the lack of transparency
in the arxiv screening process
