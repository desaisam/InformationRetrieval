early muslim explorers and missionaries arrived in bengal late in the first millennium ce the islamic conquest of bengal began with the 1204 invasion by bakhtiar khilji after annexing bengal to the delhi sultanate khilji waged a military campaign in tibet bengal was ruled by the delhi sultanate for a century by governors from the mamluk balban and tughluq dynasties during the 14th century an independent bengal sultanate was established by rebel governors the sultanates ruling houses included the ilyas shahi jalaluddin muhammad shah hussain shahi suri and karrani dynasties and the era saw the introduction of a distinct mosque architecture and the tangka currency the arakan region was brought under bengali hegemony the bengal sultanate was visited by explorers ibn battuta admiral zheng he and niccolo de conti during the late 16th century the baro-bhuyan a confederation of muslim and hindu aristocrats ruled eastern bengal its leader was the mansad-e-ala a title held by isa khan and his son musa khan the khan dynasty are considered local heroes for resisting north indian invasions with their river navies

 colonial period 

after the 1757 battle of plassey bengal was the first region of the indian subcontinent conquered by the british east india company the company formed the presidency of fort william which administered the region until 1858 a notable aspect of company rule was the permanent settlement which established the feudal zamindari system a number of famines including the great bengal famine of 1770 occurred under company rule several rebellions broke out during the early 19th century including one led by titumir but british rule displaced the muslim ruling class a conservative islamic cleric haji shariatullah sought to overthrow the british by propagating islamic revivalism several towns in bangladesh participated in the indian mutiny and pledged allegiance to the last mughal emperor bahadur shah zafar who was later exiled to neighbouring burma

the challenge posed to company rule by the failed indian mutiny led to the creation of the british indian empire as a crown colony and the first railway was built in 1862 syed ahmed khan and ram mohan roy promoted modern and liberal education on the subcontinent inspiring the aligarh movement and the bengal renaissance during the late 19th century novelists social reformers and feminists emerged from muslim bengali society electricity and municipal water systems were introduced in the 1890s cinemas opened in many towns during the early 20th century east bengals plantation economy was important to the british empire particularly its jute and tea the british established tax-free river ports such as the port of narayanganj and large seaports like the port of chittagong
social tensions also increased under british rule particularly between wealthy hindus and the muslim-majority population the permanent settlement made millions of muslim peasants tenants of hindu estates and resentment of the hindu landed gentry grew supported by the muslim aristocracy the british government created the province of eastern bengal and assam in 1905 the new province received increased investment in education transport and industry however the first partition of bengal created an uproar in calcutta and the indian national congress in response to growing hindu nationalism the all india muslim league was formed in dhaka during the 1906 all india muhammadan educational conference the british government reorganized the provinces in 1912 reuniting east and west bengal and making assam a second province

 geography 

the geography of bangladesh is divided between three regions most of the country is dominated by the fertile ganges-brahmaputra delta the northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the madhupur and the barind plateaus the northeast and southeast are home to evergreen hill ranges the ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the ganges local name padma or pôdda brahmaputra jamuna or jomuna and meghna rivers and their respective tributaries the ganges unites with the jamuna main channel of the brahmaputra and later joins the meghna finally flowing into the bay of bengal bangladesh has 57 trans-boundary rivers making the resolution of water issues politically complicated in most cases as the country is a lower riparian state to indiabangladesh is predominantly rich fertile flat land most parts of it is less than 12 m 39.4 ft above sea level and it is estimated that about 10% of its land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1 m 3.28 ft 17% of the country is covered by forests and 12% is covered by hill systems the countrys haor wetlands are of significance to global environmental science
in southeastern bangladesh experiments have been done since the 1960s to build with nature construction of cross dams has induced a natural accretion of silt creating new land with dutch funding the bangladeshi government began promoting the development of this new land in the late 1970s the effort has become a multi-agency endeavor building roads culverts embankments cyclone shelters toilets and ponds as well as distributing land to settlers it was expected that by fall 2010 the program would have allotted some 27,000 acres 10,927 ha to 21,000 families
with an elevation of 1,064 m 3,491 ft the highest peak of bangladesh is keokradong near the border with myanmar


 administrative geography 

bangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions each named after their respective divisional headquarters barisal chittagong dhaka khulna mymensingh rajshahi rangpur and sylhet
divisions are subdivided into districts zila there are 64 districts in bangladesh each further subdivided into upazila subdistricts or thana the area within each police station except for those in metropolitan areas is divided into several unions with each union consisting of multiple villages in the metropolitan areas police stations are divided into wards which are further divided into mahallas
there are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels and the administration is composed only of government officials direct elections are held in each union or ward for a chairperson and a number of members in 1997 a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats out of 12 in every union for female candidates


 climate 

straddling the tropic of cancer bangladeshs climate is tropical with a mild winter from october to march and a hot humid summer from march to june the country has never recorded an air temperature below 0 °c 32 °f with a record low of 1.1 °c 34.0 °f in the north west city of dinajpur on 3 february 1905 a warm and humid monsoon season lasts from june to october and supplies most of the countrys rainfall
natural calamities such as floods tropical cyclones tornadoes and tidal bores occur almost every year combined with the effects of deforestation soil degradation and erosion the cyclones of 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating the latter killing some 140,000 peoplein september 1998 bangladesh saw the most severe flooding in modern world history as the brahmaputra the ganges and meghna spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses 9,700 km 6,000 mi of road and 2,700 km 1,700 mi of embankment 1,000 people were killed and 30 million more were made homeless 135,000 cattle were killed 50 km2 19 sq mi of land were destroyed and 11,000 km 6,800 mi of roads were damaged or destroyed effectively two-thirds of the country was underwater
the severity of the flooding was attributed to unusually high monsoon rains the shedding of equally unusually large amounts of melt water from the himalayas and the widespread cutting down of trees that would have intercepted rain water for firewood or animal husbandrybangladesh is now widely recognised to be one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change natural hazards that come from increased rainfall rising sea levels and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as climate changes each seriously affecting agriculture water and food security human health and shelter  it is estimated that by 2050 a 3 feet rise in sea levels will inundate some 20 percent of the land and displace more than 30 million peoplethere is evidence that earthquakes pose a threat to the country and that plate tectonics have caused rivers to shift course suddenly and dramatically it has been shown that rainy-season flooding in bangladesh on the worlds largest river delta can push the underlying crust down by as much as 6 centimetres and possibly perturb faultsbangladeshi water is frequently contaminated with arsenic because of the high arsenic content of the soil—up to 77 million people are exposed to toxic arsenic from drinking water
