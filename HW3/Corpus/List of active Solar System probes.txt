this is a list of active space probes which have escaped earth orbit it includes lunar space probes but does not include space probes orbiting at the sun–earth lagrangian points for these see list of objects at lagrangian points a craft is deemed active if it is still able to transmit usable data to earth whether or not it can receive commands
the craft are further grouped by mission status – en route mission in progress or mission complete – based on their primary mission  for example though voyager 1 is still contactable en route to the heliopause it is listed as mission complete because its primary task of studying jupiter and saturn has been accomplished once a probe has reached its first primary target it is no longer listed as en route whether or not further travel is involved
