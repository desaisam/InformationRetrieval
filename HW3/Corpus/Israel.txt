 history 


 prehistory 

the oldest evidence of early humans in the territory of modern israel dating to 1.5 million years ago was found in ubeidiya near the sea of galilee other notable paleolithic sites include the caves tabun qesem and manot the oldest fossils of anatomically modern humans found outside africa are the skhul and qafzeh hominins who lived in the area that is now northern israel 120,000 years ago around 10th millennium bce the natufian culture existed in the area


 antiquity 

the early history of the territory is unclear modern archaeology has largely discarded the historicity of the narrative in the torah concerning the patriarchs the exodus and the conquest of canaan described in the book of joshua and instead views the narrative as constituting the israelites national myth during the late bronze age 1550–1200 bce large parts of canaan formed vassal states paying tribute to the new kingdom of egypt whose administrative headquarters lay in gaza ancestors of the israelites are thought to have included ancient semitic-speaking peoples native to this area the israelites and their culture according to the modern archaeological account did not overtake the region by force but instead branched out of these canaanite peoples and their cultures through the development of a distinct monolatristic—and later monotheistic—religion centered on yahweh the archaeological evidence indicates a society of village-like centres but with more limited resources and a small population villages had populations of up to 300 or 400 which lived by farming and herding and were largely self-sufficient economic interchange was prevalent writing was known and available for recording even in small sites

while it is unclear if there was ever a united monarchy there is well accepted archeological evidence referring to israel in the merneptah stele which dates to about 1200 bce and the canaanites are archaeologically attested in the middle bronze age 2100–1550 bce there is debate about the earliest existence of the kingdoms of israel and judah and their extent and power but historians agree that a kingdom of israel existed by ca 900 bce and that a kingdom of judah existed by ca 700 bce the kingdom of israel was destroyed around 720 bce when it was conquered by the neo-assyrian empirein 586 bce king nebuchadnezzar ii of babylon conquered judah according to the hebrew bible he destroyed solomons temple and exiled the jews to babylon the defeat was also recorded in the babylonian chronicles the babylonian exile ended around 538 bce under the rule of the persian cyrus the great after he captured babylon the second temple was constructed around 520 bce as part of the persian empire the former kingdom of judah became the province of judah yehud medinata with different borders covering a smaller territory the population of the province was greatly reduced from that of the kingdom archaeological surveys showing a population of around 30,000 people in the 5th to 4th centuries bce


 classical period 

with successive persian rule the autonomous province yehud medinata was gradually developing back into urban society largely dominated by judeans the greek conquests largely skipped the region without any resistance or interest incorporated into the ptolemaic and finally the seleucid empires the southern levant was heavily hellenized building the tensions between judeans and greeks the conflict erupted in 167 bce with the maccabean revolt which succeeded in establishing an independent hasmonean kingdom in judah which later expanded over much of modern israel as the seleucids gradually lost control in the region
the roman empire invaded the region in 63 bce first taking control of syria and then intervening in the hasmonean civil war the struggle between pro-roman and pro-parthian factions in judea eventually led to the installation of herod the great and consolidation of the herodian kingdom as a vassal judean state of rome with the decline of the herodian dynasty judea transformed into a roman province became the site of a violent struggle of jews against greco-romans culminating in the jewish–roman wars ending in wide-scale destruction expulsions and genocide jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled after the failure of the bar kokhba revolt against the roman empire in 132 cenevertheless there was a continuous small jewish presence and galilee became its religious center the mishnah and part of the talmud central jewish texts were composed during the 2nd to 4th centuries ce in tiberias and jerusalem the region came to be populated predominantly by greco-romans on the coast and samaritans in the hill-country christianity was gradually evolving over roman paganism when the area stood under byzantine rule through the 5th and 6th centuries the dramatic events of the repeated samaritan revolts reshaped the land with massive destruction to byzantine christian and samaritan societies and a resulting decrease of the population after the persian conquest and the installation of a short-lived jewish commonwealth in 614 ce the byzantine empire reconquered the country in 628


 middle ages and modern history 

in 634–641 ce the region including jerusalem was conquered by the arabs who had recently adopted islam control of the region transferred between the rashidun caliphs umayyads abbasids fatimids seljuks crusaders and ayyubids throughout the next three centuriesduring the siege of jerusalem by the first crusade in 1099 the jewish inhabitants of the city fought side-by-side with the fatimid garrison and the muslim population who tried in vain to defend the city against the crusaders when the city fell around 60,000 people were massacred including 6,000 jews seeking refuge in a synagogue at this time a full thousand years after the fall of the jewish state there were jewish communities all over the country fifty of them are known and include jerusalem tiberias ramleh ashkelon caesarea and gaza according to albert of aachen the jewish residents of haifa were the main fighting force of the city and mixed with saracen fatimid troops they fought bravely for close to a month until forced into retreat by the crusader fleet and land armyin 1165 maimonides visited jerusalem and prayed on the temple mount in the great holy house in 1141 the spanish-jewish poet yehuda halevi issued a call for jews to migrate to the land of israel a journey he undertook himself in 1187 sultan saladin founder of the ayyubid dynasty defeated the crusaders in the battle of hattin and subsequently captured jerusalem and almost all of palestine in time saladin issued a proclamation inviting jews to return and settle in jerusalem and according to judah al-harizi they did from the day the arabs took jerusalem the israelites inhabited it al-harizi compared saladins decree allowing jews to re-establish themselves in jerusalem to the one issued by the persian king cyrus the great over 1,600 years earlier

in 1211 the jewish community in the country was strengthened by the arrival of a group headed by over 300 rabbis from france and england among them rabbi samson ben abraham of sens nachmanides ramban the 13th-century spanish rabbi and recognised leader of jewry greatly praised the land of israel and viewed its settlement as a positive commandment incumbent on all jews he wrote if the gentiles wish to make peace we shall make peace and leave them on clear terms but as for the land we shall not leave it in their hands nor in the hands of any nation not in any generationin 1260 control passed to the mamluk sultans of egypt the country was located between the two centres of mamluk power cairo and damascus and only saw some development along the postal road connecting the two cities jerusalem although left without the protection of any city walls since 1219 also saw a flurry of new construction projects centred around the al-aqsa mosque compound on the temple mount in 1266 the mamluk sultan baybars converted the cave of the patriarchs in hebron into an exclusive islamic sanctuary and banned christians and jews from entering who previously had been able to enter it for a fee the ban remained in place until israel took control of the building in 1967

in 1470 isaac b meir latif arrived from italy and counted 150 jewish families in jerusalem
thanks to joseph saragossi who had arrived in the closing years of the 15th century safed and its environs had developed into the largest concentration of jews in palestine with the help of the sephardic immigration from spain the jewish population had increased to 10,000 by the early 16th centuryin 1516 the region was conquered by the ottoman empire it remained under turkish rule until the end of the first world war when britain defeated the ottoman forces and set up a military administration across the former ottoman syria in 1660 a druze revolt led to the destruction of safed and tiberias in late 18th century local arab sheikh zahir al-umar created a de facto independent emirate in the galilee ottoman attempts to subdue the sheikh failed but after zahirs death the ottomans regained control of the area in 1799 governor jazzar pasha successfully repelled an assault on acre by troops of napoleon prompting the french to abandon the syrian campaign in 1834 a revolt by palestinian arab peasants broke out against egyptian conscription and taxation policies under muhammad ali although the revolt was suppressed muhammad alis army retreated and ottoman rule was restored with british support in 1840 shortly after the tanzimat reforms were implemented across the ottoman empire in 1920 after the allies conquered the levant during world war i the territory was divided between britain and france under the mandate system and the british-administered area which included modern day israel was named mandatory palestine


 zionism and british mandate 

since the existence of the earliest jewish diaspora many jews have aspired to return to zion and the land of israel though the amount of effort that should be spent towards such an aim was a matter of dispute the hopes and yearnings of jews living in exile are an important theme of the jewish belief system after the jews were expelled from spain in 1492 some communities settled in palestine during the 16th century jewish communities struck roots in the four holy cities—jerusalem tiberias hebron and safed—and in 1697 rabbi yehuda hachasid led a group of 1,500 jews to jerusalem in the second half of the 18th century eastern european opponents of hasidism known as the perushim settled in palestine

the first wave of modern jewish migration to ottoman-ruled palestine known as the first aliyah began in 1881 as jews fled pogroms in eastern europe although the zionist movement already existed in practice austro-hungarian journalist theodor herzl is credited with founding political zionism a movement that sought to establish a jewish state in the land of israel thus offering a solution to the so-called jewish question of the european states in conformity with the goals and achievements of other national projects of the time in 1896 herzl published der judenstaat the jewish state offering his vision of a future jewish state the following year he presided over the first zionist congressthe second aliyah 1904–14 began after the kishinev pogrom some 40,000 jews settled in palestine although nearly half of them left eventually both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly orthodox jews although the second aliyah included socialist groups who established the kibbutz movement during world war i british foreign secretary arthur balfour sent the balfour declaration of 1917 to baron rothschild walter rothschild 2nd baron rothschild a leader of the british jewish community that stated that britain intended for the creation of a jewish national home within the palestinian mandatein 1918 the jewish legion a group primarily of zionist volunteers assisted in the british conquest of palestine arab opposition to british rule and jewish immigration led to the 1920 palestine riots and the formation of a jewish militia known as the haganah meaning the defense in hebrew from which the irgun and lehi or the stern gang paramilitary groups later split off in 1922 the league of nations granted britain a mandate over palestine under terms which included the balfour declaration with its promise to the jews and with similar provisions regarding the arab palestinians the population of the area at this time was predominantly arab and muslim with jews accounting for about 11 and arab christians about 9.5% of the populationthe third 1919–23 and fourth aliyahs 1924–29 brought an additional 100,000 jews to palestine the rise of nazism and the increasing persecution of jews in 1930s europe led to the fifth aliyah with an influx of a quarter of a million jews this was a major cause of the arab revolt of 1936–39 during which the british mandate authorities alongside the zionist militias of haganah and irgun killed 5,032 arabs and wounded 14,760 resulting in over ten percent of the adult male palestinian arab population killed wounded imprisoned or exiled the british introduced restrictions on jewish immigration to palestine with the white paper of 1939 with countries around the world turning away jewish refugees fleeing the holocaust a clandestine movement known as aliyah bet was organized to bring jews to palestine by the end of world war ii the jewish population of palestine had increased to 33% of the total population


 after world war ii 

after world war ii britain found itself in intense conflict with the jewish community over jewish immigration limits as well as continued conflict with the arab community over limit levels the haganah joined irgun and lehi in an armed struggle against british rule at the same time hundreds of thousands of jewish holocaust survivors and refugees sought a new life far from their destroyed communities in europe the yishuv attempted to bring these refugees to palestine but many were turned away or rounded up and placed in detention camps in atlit and cyprus by the britishon 22 july 1946 irgun attacked the british administrative headquarters for palestine which was housed in the southern wing of the king david hotel in jerusalem a total of 91 people of various nationalities were killed and 46 were injured the hotel was the site of the secretariat of the government of palestine and the headquarters of the british armed forces in palestine and transjordan the attack initially had the approval of the haganah it was conceived as a response to operation agatha a series of widespread raids including one on the jewish agency conducted by the british authorities and was the deadliest directed at the british during the mandate era it was characterized as one of the most lethal terrorist incidents of the twentieth century in 1947 the british government announced it would withdraw from palestine stating it was unable to arrive at a solution acceptable to both arabs and jews
on 15 may 1947 the general assembly of the newly formed united nations resolved that the united nations special committee on palestine be created to prepare for consideration at the next regular session of the assembly a report on the question of palestine in the report of the committee dated 3 september 1947 to the general assembly the majority of the committee in chapter vi proposed a plan to replace the british mandate with an independent arab state an independent jewish state and the city of jerusalem  the last to be under an international trusteeship system on 29 november 1947 the general assembly adopted resolution 181 ii recommending the adoption and implementation of the plan of partition with economic union the plan attached to the resolution was essentially that proposed by the majority of the committee in the report of 3 september the jewish agency which was the recognized representative of the jewish community accepted the plan the arab league and arab higher committee of palestine rejected it and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition on the following day 1 december 1947 the arab higher committee proclaimed a three-day strike and arab gangs began attacking jewish targets the jews were initially on the defensive as civil war broke out but in early april 1948 moved onto the offensive the arab palestinian economy collapsed and 250,000 palestinian arabs fled or were expelledon 14 may 1948 the day before the expiration of the british mandate david ben-gurion the head of the jewish agency declared the establishment of a jewish state in eretz-israel to be known as the state of israel the only reference in the text of the declaration to the borders of the new state is the use of the term eretz-israel land of israel the following day the armies of four arab countries—egypt syria transjordan and iraq—entered what had been british mandatory palestine launching the 1948 arab–israeli war contingents from yemen morocco saudi arabia and sudan joined the war the apparent purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the jewish state at inception and some arab leaders talked about driving the jews into the sea according to benny morris jews felt that the invading arab armies aimed to slaughter the jews the arab league stated that the invasion was to restore law and order and to prevent further bloodshedafter a year of fighting a ceasefire was declared and temporary borders known as the green line were established jordan annexed what became known as the west bank including east jerusalem and egypt took control of the gaza strip the un estimated that more than 700,000 palestinians were expelled by or fled from advancing israeli forces during the conflict—what would become known in arabic as the nakba catastrophe some 156,000 remained and became arab citizens of israel


 early years of the state of israel 

israel was admitted as a member of the un by majority vote on 11 may 1949 both israel and jordan were genuinely interested in a peace agreement but the british acted as a brake on the jordanian effort in order to avoid damaging british interests in egypt in the early years of the state the labor zionist movement led by prime minister david ben-gurion dominated israeli politics the kibbutzim or collective farming communities played a pivotal role in establishing the new stateimmigration to israel during the late 1940s and early 1950s was aided by the israeli immigration department and the non-government sponsored mossad lealiyah bet lit institute for immigration b which organized illegal and clandestine immigration both groups facilitated regular immigration logistics like arranging transportation but the latter also engaged in clandestine operations in countries particularly in the middle east and eastern europe where the lives of jews were believed to be in danger and exit from those places was difficult mossad lealiyah bet was disbanded in 1953 the immigration was in accordance with the one million plan the immigrants came for differing reasons some held zionist beliefs or came for the promise of a better life in israel while others moved to escape persecution or were expelledan influx of holocaust survivors and jews from arab and muslim countries to israel during the first three years increased the number of jews from 700,000 to 1,400,000 by 1958 the population of israel rose to two million between 1948 and 1970 approximately 1,150,000 jewish refugees relocated to israel some new immigrants arrived as refugees with no possessions and were housed in temporary camps known as maabarot by 1952 over 200,000 people were living in these tent cities jews of european background were often treated more favorably than jews from middle eastern and north african countries—housing units reserved for the latter were often re-designated for the former with the result that jews newly arrived from arab lands generally ended up staying in transit camps for longer tensions that developed between the two groups over such discrimination persist to the present day during this period food clothes and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the austerity period the need to solve the crisis led ben-gurion to sign a reparations agreement with west germany that triggered mass protests by jews angered at the idea that israel could accept monetary compensation for the holocaust

during the 1950s israel was frequently attacked by palestinian fedayeen nearly always against civilians mainly from the egyptian-occupied gaza strip leading to several israeli counter-raids in 1956 great britain and france aimed at regaining control of the suez canal which the egyptians had nationalized the continued blockade of the suez canal and straits of tiran to israeli shipping together with the growing amount of fedayeen attacks against israels southern population and recent arab grave and threatening statements prompted israel to attack egypt israel joined a secret alliance with great britain and france and overran the sinai peninsula but was pressured to withdraw by the un in return for guarantees of israeli shipping rights in the red sea via the straits of tiran and the canal the war known as the suez crisis resulted in significant reduction of israeli border infiltration in the early 1960s israel captured nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in argentina and brought him to israel for trial the trial had a major impact on public awareness of the holocaust eichmann remains the only person executed in israel by conviction in an israeli civilian court

since 1964 arab countries concerned over israeli plans to divert waters of the jordan river into the coastal plain had been trying to divert the headwaters to deprive israel of water resources provoking tensions between israel on the one hand and syria and lebanon on the other arab nationalists led by egyptian president gamal abdel nasser refused to recognize israel and called for its destruction by 1966 israeli-arab relations had deteriorated to the point of actual battles taking place between israeli and arab forces in may 1967 egypt massed its army near the border with israel expelled un peacekeepers stationed in the sinai peninsula since 1957 and blocked israels access to the red sea other arab states mobilized their forces israel reiterated that these actions were a casus belli and on 5 june launched a pre-emptive strike against egypt jordan syria and iraq responded and attacked israel in a six-day war israel defeated jordan and captured the west bank defeated egypt and captured the gaza strip and sinai peninsula and defeated syria and captured the golan heights jerusalems boundaries were enlarged incorporating east jerusalem and the 1949 green line became the administrative boundary between israel and the occupied territories
following the 1967 war and the three nos resolution of the arab league and during the 1967–1970 war of attrition israel faced attacks from the egyptians in the sinai peninsula and from palestinian groups targeting israelis in the occupied territories in israel proper and around the world most important among the various palestinian and arab groups was the palestinian liberation organization plo established in 1964 which initially committed itself to armed struggle as the only way to liberate the homeland in the late 1960s and early 1970s palestinian groups launched a wave of attacks against israeli and jewish targets around the world including a massacre of israeli athletes at the 1972 summer olympics in munich the israeli government responded with an assassination campaign against the organizers of the massacre a bombing and a raid on the plo headquarters in lebanon
on 6 october 1973 as jews were observing yom kippur the egyptian and syrian armies launched a surprise attack against israeli forces in the sinai peninsula and golan heights that opened the yom kippur war the war ended on 25 october with israel successfully repelling egyptian and syrian forces but having suffered over 2,500 soldiers killed in a war which collectively took 10–35,000 lives in about 20 days an internal inquiry exonerated the government of responsibility for failures before and during the war but public anger forced prime minister golda meir to resign in july 1976 an airliner was hijacked during its flight from israel to france by palestinian guerrillas and landed at entebbe uganda israeli commandos carried out an operation in which 102 out of 106 israeli hostages were successfully rescued


 further conflict and peace process 

the 1977 knesset elections marked a major turning point in israeli political history as menachem begins likud party took control from the labor party later that year egyptian president anwar el sadat made a trip to israel and spoke before the knesset in what was the first recognition of israel by an arab head of state in the two years that followed sadat and begin signed the camp david accords 1978 and the israel–egypt peace treaty 1979 in return israel withdrew from the sinai peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over an autonomy for palestinians in the west bank and the gaza stripon 11 march 1978 a plo guerilla raid from lebanon led to the coastal road massacre israel responded by launching an invasion of southern lebanon to destroy the plo bases south of the litani river most plo fighters withdrew but israel was able to secure southern lebanon until a un force and the lebanese army could take over the plo soon resumed its policy of attacks against israel in the next few years the plo infiltrated the south and kept up a sporadic shelling across the border israel carried out numerous retaliatory attacks by air and on the ground

 geography and environment 

israel is located in the levant area of the fertile crescent region the country is at the eastern end of the mediterranean sea bounded by lebanon to the north syria to the northeast jordan and the west bank to the east and egypt and the gaza strip to the southwest it lies between latitudes 29° and 34° n and longitudes 34° and 36° e
the sovereign territory of israel according to the demarcation lines of the 1949 armistice agreements and excluding all territories captured by israel during the 1967 six-day war is approximately 20,770 square kilometers 8,019 sq mi in area of which two percent is water however israel is so narrow that the exclusive economic zone in the mediterranean is double the land area of the country the total area under israeli law including east jerusalem and the golan heights is 22,072 square kilometers 8,522 sq mi and the total area under israeli control including the military-controlled and partially palestinian-governed territory of the west bank is 27,799 square kilometers 10,733 sq midespite its small size israel is home to a variety of geographic features from the negev desert in the south to the inland fertile jezreel valley mountain ranges of the galilee carmel and toward the golan in the north the israeli coastal plain on the shores of the mediterranean is home to most of the nations population east of the central highlands lies the jordan rift valley which forms a small part of the 6,500-kilometer 4,039 mi great rift valley the jordan river runs along the jordan rift valley from mount hermon through the hulah valley and the sea of galilee to the dead sea the lowest point on the surface of the earth further south is the arabah ending with the gulf of eilat part of the red sea unique to israel and the sinai peninsula are makhteshim or erosion cirques the largest makhtesh in the world is ramon crater in the negev which measures 40 by 8 kilometers 25 by 5 mi a report on the environmental status of the mediterranean basin states that israel has the largest number of plant species per square meter of all the countries in the basin


 tectonics and seismicity 

the jordan rift valley is the result of tectonic movements within the dead sea transform dsf fault system the dsf forms the transform boundary between the african plate to the west and the arabian plate to the east the golan heights and all of jordan are part of the arabian plate while the galilee west bank coastal plain and negev along with the sinai peninsula are on the african plate this tectonic disposition leads to a relatively high seismic activity in the region the entire jordan valley segment is thought to have ruptured repeatedly for instance during the last two major earthquakes along this structure in 749 and 1033 the deficit in slip that has built up since the 1033 event is sufficient to cause an earthquake of mw 7.4the most catastrophic known earthquakes occurred in 31 bce 363 749 and 1033 ce that is every ca 400 years on average destructive earthquakes leading to serious loss of life strike about every 80 years while stringent construction regulations are currently in place and recently built structures are earthquake-safe as of  2007 the majority of the buildings in israel were older than these regulations and many public buildings as well as 50,000 residential buildings did not meet the new standards and were expected to collapse if exposed to a strong earthquake


 climate 

temperatures in israel vary widely especially during the winter coastal areas such as those of tel aviv and haifa have a typical mediterranean climate with cool rainy winters and long hot summers the area of beersheba and the northern negev have a semi-arid climate with hot summers cool winters and fewer rainy days than the mediterranean climate the southern negev and the arava areas have a desert climate with very hot dry summers and mild winters with few days of rain the highest temperature in the continent of asia 54.0 °c or 129.2 °f was recorded in 1942 at tirat zvi kibbutz in the northern jordan river valleyat the other extreme mountainous regions can be windy and cold and areas at elevation of 750 metres 2,460 ft or more same elevation as jerusalem will usually receive at least one snowfall each year from may to september rain in israel is rare with scarce water resources israel has developed various water-saving technologies including drip irrigation israelis also take advantage of the considerable sunlight available for solar energy making israel the leading nation in solar energy use per capita practically every house uses solar panels for water heatingfour different phytogeographic regions exist in israel due to the countrys location between the temperate and tropical zones bordering the mediterranean sea in the west and the desert in the east for this reason the flora and fauna of israel are extremely diverse there are 2,867 known species of plants found in israel of these at least 253 species are introduced and non-native there are 380 israeli nature reserves

 education 

education is highly valued in the israeli culture and was viewed as a fundamental block of ancient israelites jewish communities in the levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community not less than the parents was responsible many international business leaders such as microsoft founder bill gates have praised israel for its high quality of education in helping spur israels economic development and technological boom in 2015 the country ranked third among oecd members after canada and japan for the percentage of 25–64 year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 49% compared with the oecd average of 35 in 2012 the country ranked third in the world in the number of academic degrees per capita 20 percent of the populationisrael has a school life expectancy of 16 years and a literacy rate of 97.8 the state education law passed in 1953 established five types of schools state secular state religious ultra orthodox communal settlement schools and arab schools the public secular is the largest school group and is attended by the majority of jewish and non-arab pupils in israel most arabs send their children to schools where arabic is the language of instruction education is compulsory in israel for children between the ages of three and eighteen schooling is divided into three tiers – primary school grades 1–6 middle school grades 7–9 and high school grades 10–12 – culminating with bagrut matriculation exams proficiency in core subjects such as mathematics the hebrew language hebrew and general literature the english language history biblical scripture and civics is necessary to receive a bagrut certificate israels jewish population maintains a relatively high level of educational attainment where just under half of all israeli jews 46 hold post-secondary degrees this figure has remained stable in their already high levels of educational attainment over recent generations israeli jews among those ages 25 and older have average of 11.6 years of schooling making them one of the most highly educated of all major religious groups in the world in arab christian and druze schools the exam on biblical studies is replaced by an exam on muslim christian or druze heritage maariv described the christian arabs sectors as the most successful in education system since christians fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other religion in israel israeli children from russian-speaking families have a higher bagrut pass rate at high-school level amongst immigrant children born in the former soviet union the bagrut pass rate is higher amongst those families from european fsu states at 62.6% and lower amongst those from central asian and caucasian fsu states in 2014 61.5% of all israeli twelfth graders earned a matriculation certificate

the basic laws of israel function as an uncodified constitution in 2003 the knesset began to draft an official constitution based on these lawsthe president of israel is head of state with limited and largely ceremonial dutiesisrael has no official religion but the definition of the state as jewish and democratic creates a strong connection with judaism as well as a conflict between state law and religious law interaction between the political parties keeps the balance between state and religion largely as it existed during the british mandateon 19 july 2018 the israeli parliament passed a basic law that characterizes the state of israel as principally a nation state of the jewish people and hebrew as its official language the bill ascribes special status to the arabic language the same bill gives jews a unique right to national self-determination and views the developing of jewish settlement in the country as a national interest empowering the government to take steps to encourage advance and implement this interest

 israeli-occupied territories 

in 1967 as a result of the six-day war israel captured and occupied the west bank including east jerusalem the gaza strip and the golan heights israel also captured the sinai peninsula but returned it to egypt as part of the 1979 egypt–israel peace treaty between 1982 and 2000 israel occupied part of southern lebanon in what was known as the security belt since israels capture of these territories israeli settlements and military installations have been built within each of them except lebanon
the golan heights and east jerusalem have been fully incorporated into israel under israeli law but not under international law israel has applied civilian law to both areas and granted their inhabitants permanent residency status and the ability to apply for citizenship the un security council has declared the annexation of the golan heights and east jerusalem to be null and void and continues to view the territories as occupied the status of east jerusalem in any future peace settlement has at times been a difficult issue in negotiations between israeli governments and representatives of the palestinians as israel views it as its sovereign territory as well as part of its capital

the west bank excluding east jerusalem is known in israeli law as the judea and samaria area the almost 400,000 israeli settlers  residing in the area are considered part of israels population have knesset representation a large part of israels civil and criminal laws applied to them and their output is considered part of israels economy the land itself is not considered part of israel under israeli law as israel has consciously refrained from annexing the territory without ever relinquishing its legal claim to the land or defining a border with the area there is no border between israel-proper and the west bank for israeli vehicles israeli political opposition to annexation is primarily due to the perceived demographic threat of incorporating the west banks palestinian population into israel outside of the israeli settlements the west bank remains under direct israeli military rule and palestinians in the area cannot become israeli citizens the international community maintains that israel does not have sovereignty in the west bank and considers israels control of the area to be the longest military occupation is modern history the west bank was occupied and annexed by jordan in 1950 following the arab rejection of the un decision to create two states in palestine only britain recognized this annexation and jordan has since ceded its claim to the territory to the plo the population are mainly palestinians including refugees of the 1948 arab–israeli war from their occupation in 1967 until 1993 the palestinians living in these territories were under israeli military administration since the israel–plo letters of recognition most of the palestinian population and cities have been under the internal jurisdiction of the palestinian authority and only partial israeli military control although israel has on several occasions redeployed its troops and reinstated full military administration during periods of unrest in response to increasing attacks during the second intifada the israeli government started to construct the israeli west bank barrier when completed approximately 13% of the barrier will be constructed on the green line or in israel with 87% inside the west bank

the gaza strip is considered to be a foreign territory under israeli law however since israel operates a land air and sea blockade of the gaza strip together with egypt the international community considers israel to be the occupying power the gaza strip was occupied by egypt from 1948 to 1967 and then by israel after 1967 in 2005 as part of israels unilateral disengagement plan israel removed all of its settlers and forces from the territory however it continues to maintain control of its airspace and waters the international community including numerous international humanitarian organizations and various bodies of the un consider gaza to remain occupied following the 2007 battle of gaza when hamas assumed power in the gaza strip israel tightened its control of the gaza crossings along its border as well as by sea and air and prevented persons from entering and exiting the area except for isolated cases it deemed humanitarian gaza has a border with egypt and an agreement between israel the european union and the pa governed how border crossing would take place it was monitored by european observersthe international court of justice principal judicial organ of the un asserted in its 2004 advisory opinion on the legality of the construction of the israeli west bank barrier that the lands captured by israel in the six-day war including east jerusalem are occupied territory most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of un security council resolution 242 which emphasises the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and calls on israel to withdraw from occupied territories in return for normalization of relations with arab states a principle known as land for peace according to some observers israel has engaged in systematic and widespread violations of human rights in the occupied territories including the occupation itself and war crimes against civilians the allegations include violations of international humanitarian law by the un human rights council with local residents having limited ability to hold governing authorities accountable for such abuses by the us state department mass arbitrary arrests torture unlawful killings systemic abuses and impunity by amnesty international and others and a denial of the right to palestinian self-determination in response to such allegations prime minister netanyahu has defended the countrys security forces for protecting the innocent from terrorists and expressed contempt for what he describes as a lack of concern about the human rights violations committed by criminal killers some observers such as israeli officials scholars united states ambassador to the un nikki haley and un secretary-generals ban ki-moon and kofi annan also assert that the un is disproportionately concerned with israeli misconduct
