 history 

the discovery of the mauer 1 mandible shows that ancient humans were present in germany at least 600,000 years ago the oldest complete hunting weapons found anywhere in the world were discovered in a coal mine in schöningen between 1994 and 1998 where eight 380,000-year-old wooden javelins of 1.82 to 2.25 m 5.97 to 7.38 ft length were unearthed the neander valley was the location where the first ever non-modern human fossil was discovered the new species of human was called the neanderthal the neanderthal 1 fossils are known to be 40,000 years old evidence of modern humans similarly dated has been found in caves in the swabian jura near ulm the finds included 42,000-year-old bird bone and mammoth ivory flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found the 40,000-year-old ice age lion man which is the oldest uncontested figurative art ever discovered and the 35,000-year-old venus of hohle fels which is the oldest uncontested human figurative art ever discovered the nebra sky disk is a bronze artefact created during the european bronze age attributed to a site near nebra saxony-anhalt it is part of unescos memory of the world programme


 germanic tribes and frankish empire 

the germanic tribes are thought to date from the nordic bronze age or the pre-roman iron age from southern scandinavia and north germany they expanded south east and west from the 1st century bc coming into contact with the celtic tribes of gaul as well as iranian baltic and slavic tribes in central and eastern europe under augustus rome began to invade germania an area extending roughly from the rhine to the ural mountains in 9 ad three roman legions led by varus were defeated by the cheruscan leader arminius by 100 ad when tacitus wrote germania germanic tribes had settled along the rhine and the danube the limes germanicus occupying most of the area of modern germany however austria baden württemberg southern bavaria southern hessen and the western rhineland had been conquered and incorporated into roman provinces noricum raetia germania superior and germania inferior

in the 3rd century a number of large west germanic tribes emerged alemanni franks chatti saxons frisii sicambri and thuringii around 260 the germanic peoples broke into roman-controlled lands after the invasion of the huns in 375 and with the decline of rome from 395 germanic tribes moved farther southwest simultaneously several large tribes formed in what is now germany and displaced or absorbed smaller germanic tribes large areas known since the merovingian period as austrasia neustria and aquitaine were conquered by the franks who established the frankish kingdom and pushed farther east to subjugate saxony and bavaria areas of what is today the eastern part of germany were inhabited by western slavic tribes of sorbs veleti and the obotritic confederation


 east francia and holy roman empire 

in 800 the frankish king charlemagne was crowned emperor and founded the carolingian empire which was later divided in 843 among his heirs following the break up of the frankish realm for 900 years the history of germany was intertwined with the history of the holy roman empire which subsequently emerged from the eastern portion of charlemagnes original empire the territory initially known as east francia stretched from the rhine in the west to the elbe river in the east and from the north sea to the alps the ottonian rulers 919–1024 consolidated several major duchies and the german king otto i was crowned holy roman emperor of these regions in 962 in 996 gregory v became the first german pope appointed by his cousin otto iii whom he shortly after crowned holy roman emperor the holy roman empire absorbed northern italy and burgundy under the reign of the salian emperors 1024–1125 although the emperors lost power through the investiture controversy

in the 12th century under the hohenstaufen emperors 1138–1254 german princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by slavs they encouraged german settlement in these areas called the eastern settlement movement ostsiedlung members of the hanseatic league which included mostly north german cities and towns prospered in the expansion of trade in the south the greater ravensburg trade corporation grosse ravensburger handelsgesellschaft served a similar function the edict of the golden bull issued in 1356 by emperor charles iv provided the basic constitutional structure of the empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics

population declined in the first half of the 14th century starting with the great famine in 1315 followed by the black death of 1348–50 despite the decline however german artists engineers and scientists developed a wide array of techniques similar to those used by the italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant city-states as venice florence and genoa artistic and cultural centres throughout the german states produced such artists as the augsburg painters hans holbein and his son and albrecht dürer johannes gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to europe a development that laid the basis for the spread of learning to the massesin 1517 the wittenberg priest martin luther nailed the ninety-five theses to the church door challenging the practice of selling of indulgences he was subsequently excommunicated in the papal bull exsurge domine in 1520 and his followers were condemned in the 1521 diet of worms which divided western christianity in 1555 the peace of augsburg tolerated the evangelical faith now called lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to catholicism but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects a principle called cuius regio eius religio the agreement at augsburg failed to address other religious creed for example the reformed faith was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler such as happened in electorate of cologne in 1583 however in practice calvinists were given protection under the augsburg confession variata modified upon request by phillip melancthon 

from the cologne war until the end of the thirty years wars 1618–1648 religious conflict devastated german lands the latter reduced the overall population of the german states by about 30 per cent and in some places up to 80 per cent the peace of westphalia ended religious warfare among the imperial estates of the holy roman empire their mostly german-speaking rulers were able to choose either roman catholicism lutheranism or the reformed faith as their official religion after 1648in the 18th century the holy roman empire consisted of approximately 1,800 territories the elaborate legal system initiated by a series of imperial reforms approximately 1450–1555 created the imperial estates and provided for considerable local autonomy among ecclesiastical secular and hereditary states reflected in the imperial diet the house of habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of charles vi in 1740 having no male heirs he had convinced the electors to retain habsburg hegemony in the office of the emperor by agreeing to the pragmatic sanction of 1713 this was finally settled through the war of austrian succession in the treaty of aix-la-chapelle charles vis daughter maria theresa ruled the empire as empress consort when her husband francis i became holy roman emperor from 1740 the dualism between the austrian habsburg monarchy and the kingdom of prussia dominated the german history
in 1772 then again in 1793 and 1795 the two dominant german states of prussia and austria along with the russian empire agreed to the partitions of poland dividing among themselves the lands of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth as a result of the partitions millions of polish speaking inhabitants fell under the rule of the two german monarchies however the annexed territories though incorporated into the kingdom of prussia and the habsburg realm were not legally considered as a part of the holy roman empire during the period of the french revolutionary wars along with the arrival of the napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the imperial diet most of the secular free imperial cities were annexed by dynastic territories the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed in 1806 the imperium was dissolved many german states particularly the rhineland states fell under the influence of france until 1815 france russia prussia and the habsburgs austria competed for hegemony in the german states during the napoleonic wars


 german confederation and empire 

following the fall of napoleon the congress of vienna convened in 1814 founded the german confederation deutscher bund a loose league of 39 sovereign states the appointment of the emperor of austria as the permanent president of the confederation reflected the congresss failure to accept prussias rising influence among the german states and acerbated the long-standing competition between the hohenzollern and habsburg interests disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements followed by new measures of repression by austrian statesman metternich the zollverein a tariff union furthered economic unity in the german statesnational and liberal ideals of the french revolution gained increasing support among many especially young germans the hambach festival in may 1832 was a main event in support of german unity freedom and democracy in the light of a series of revolutionary movements in europe which established a republic in france intellectuals and commoners started the revolutions of 1848 in the german states king frederick william iv of prussia was offered the title of emperor but with a loss of power he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution leading to a temporary setback for the movement

king william i appointed otto von bismarck as the new minister president of prussia in 1862 bismarck successfully concluded war on denmark in 1864 which promoted german over danish interests in the jutland peninsula the subsequent and decisive prussian victory in the austro-prussian war of 1866 enabled him to create the north german confederation norddeutscher bund which excluded austria from the federations affairs after the french defeat in the franco-prussian war the german princes proclaimed the founding of the german empire in 1871 at versailles uniting all the scattered parts of germany except austria and the german-speaking parts of switzerland prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire the hohenzollern king of prussia ruled as its concurrent emperor and berlin became its capitalin the gründerzeit period following the unification of germany bismarcks foreign policy as chancellor of germany under emperor william i secured germanys position as a great nation by forging alliances isolating france by diplomatic means and avoiding war under wilhelm ii germany like other european powers took an imperialistic course leading to friction with neighbouring countries most alliances in which germany had previously been involved were not renewed this resulted in the creation of a dual alliance with the multinational realm of austria-hungary promoting at least benevolent neutrality if not outright military support subsequently the triple alliance of 1882 included italy completing a central european geographic alliance that illustrated german austrian and italian fears of incursions against them by france andor russia similarly britain france and russia also concluded alliances that would protect them against habsburg interference with russian interests in the balkans or german interference against france

at the berlin conference in 1884 germany claimed several colonies including german east africa german south west africa togoland and kamerun later germany further expanded its colonial empire to include german new guinea german micronesia and german samoa in the pacific and kiautschou bay in china in what became known as the first genocide of the twentieth-century between 1904 and 1907 the german colonial government in south west africa present-day namibia ordered the annihilation of the local herero and namaqua peoples as a punitive measure for an uprising against german colonial rule in total around 100,000 people—80% of the herero and 50% of the namaqua—perished from imprisonment in concentration camps where the majority died of disease abuse and exhaustion or from dehydration and starvation in the countryside after being deprived of food and waterthe assassination of austrias crown prince on 28 june 1914 provided the pretext for the austrian empire to attack serbia and trigger world war i after four years of warfare in which approximately two million german soldiers were killed a general armistice ended the fighting on 11 november and german troops returned home in the german revolution november 1918 emperor wilhelm ii and all german ruling princes abdicated their positions and responsibilities germanys new political leadership signed the treaty of versailles in 1919 in this treaty germany as part of the central powers accepted defeat by the allies in one of the bloodiest conflicts of all time germans perceived the treaty as humiliating and unjust and it was later seen by historians as influential in the rise of adolf hitler after the defeat in the first world war germany lost around 13% of its european territory areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic polish french and danish populations which were lost following the greater poland uprising the return of alsace-lorraine and the schleswig plebiscites and all of its colonial possessions in africa and the south sea

 east and west germany 

after nazi germany surrendered the allies partitioned berlin and germanys remaining territory into four military occupation zones the western sectors controlled by france the united kingdom and the united states were merged on 23 may 1949 to form the federal republic of germany bundesrepublik deutschland on 7 october 1949 the soviet zone became the german democratic republic deutsche demokratische republik they were informally known as west germany and east germany east germany selected east berlin as its capital while west germany chose bonn as a provisional capital to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary status quowest germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a social market economy starting in 1948 west germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the marshall plan and used this to rebuild its industry konrad adenauer was elected the first federal chancellor bundeskanzler of germany in 1949 and remained in office until 1963 under his and ludwig erhards leadership the country enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s that became known as an economic miracle wirtschaftswunder the federal republic of germany joined nato in 1955 and was a founding member of the european economic community in 1957

east germany was an eastern bloc state under political and military control by the ussr via occupation forces and the warsaw pact although east germany claimed to be a democracy political power was exercised solely by leading members politbüro of the communist-controlled socialist unity party of germany supported by the stasi an immense secret service controlling many aspects of the society a soviet-style command economy was set up and the gdr later became a comecon state while east german propaganda was based on the benefits of the gdrs social programmes and the alleged constant threat of a west german invasion many of its citizens looked to the west for freedom and prosperitythe berlin wall rapidly built on 13 august 1961 prevented east german citizens from escaping to west germany eventually becoming a symbol of the cold war ronald reagans tear down this wall speech at the wall on 12 june 1987 echoed john f kennedys ich bin ein berliner speech of 26 june 1963 the fall of the wall in 1989 became a symbol of the fall of communism the dissolution of the soviet union german reunification and die wendetensions between east and west germany were reduced in the early 1970s by chancellor willy brandts ostpolitik in summer 1989 hungary decided to dismantle the iron curtain and open the borders causing the emigration of thousands of east germans to west germany via hungary this had devastating effects on the gdr where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support the east german authorities eased the border restrictions allowing east german citizens to travel to the west originally intended to help retain east germany as a state the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the wende reform process this culminated in the two plus four treaty a year later on 12 september 1990 under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the instrument of surrender and germany regained full sovereignty this permitted german reunification on 3 october 1990 with the accession of the five re-established states of the former gdr
