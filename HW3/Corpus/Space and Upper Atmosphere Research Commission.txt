 history 


 creation 

the independent research in space sciences and aeronautical development was ensued and goaded by the senior physicists at the department of physics of the punjab university in 1957 following the successful launch of soviet unions first artificial satellite the sputnik 1 however due to the political instability the serious initiatives to establish the programme were not undertaken by the government of pakistan since 1958 nobel laureate abdus salam had played a major and influential role in the development of pakistans science policy it was salams advice to the president field marshal ayub khan to establish a national space authority to oversee the development on the space programme this led to the establishment of the space and upper atmosphere research commission denoted as suparco on 16 september 1961 with abdus salam being its first administrator and director it was decided to set up a committee dealing with space sciences consequently a space sciences research wing at the pakistan atomic energy commission paec within few weeks the committee was established through the presidential executive order peo of president ayub khan which was addressed to co-chairman ishrat usmani the chairman of paec the programme of rocket test firings was entrusted to the chairman of paec


 1960s space flight programmes 
one of the most earliest and notable achievements of suparco activities was its unmanned space flight programme that was recorded on 7 june 1962 suparco made research in the development of first solid-fuel expandable rockets an assistance provided by the united states on 7 june 1962 suparco landed a record achievement when it launched first unmanned solid-fuel sounding rocket and took its first initial space flight from the sonmiani terminal launch the rocket was developed in a joint venture with air force in a team led by pafs air commodore brigadier-general wjm turowicz known as the rehbar-i lit teller of the way pakistan had secured its distinction as the third country in asia and the tenth in the world to conduct successful spaceflight the unmanned spaceflight mission continued under turowicz and according to suparco since 1962 til the partial termination of mission in 1972 200 sounding rockets took high success space flights from sonmiani terminal launch the national aeronautics and space administration nasa publicly hailed the space flight programme as the beginning of a programme of continuous cooperation in space research of mutual interest

this cooperative agreement called for the training of pakistans scientists engineers and technicians at the specialized facilities in the united states before the june 1962 space flight programme nasa had begun to train pakistans scientists at wallops island and the goddard space flight centres nasa also set up fellowships and research associate programmes at various american universities for advanced training and experienceon 25 july 1964 salam arranged another meeting with president ayub khan where suparco was placed under the direct control of the president of pakistan it was followed by constitution of suparco as an executive but separate authority under the administrative control of salam on 8 march 1966 by the presidential decree salam was brought as its first and founding chairman and given the powers previously held by the paec chairmanabdus salam laid foundation of space infrastructure in karachi and lahore particularly establishing infrastructure for physics research with the establishment of suparco pakistan was the first south asian country to start a space programme in 1967 abdus salam was succeeded by air commdore władysław turowicz as he was made administrator of suparco air commdore turowicz led the foundation of research activities and rocketry development in suparco to the field of aeronautic sciences the doppler radar station islamabad mission control center was also established in the country as a part of a global network in 1973 american apollo 17 astronauts eugene cernan ronald evans and harrison schmitt paid a state visit to karachi amid great fanfare to see the suparcos headquarters        during the early 1970s the islamabad ionospheric station within quaid-e-azam university was set up and the nasa landsat ground station was established near rawat


 1970s–1980s bureaucratization and reorganization 
entering in the late 1970s era the space programme suffered many setback and experience number of difficulties including lack of government response shortage of technical personnel and expert engineers needed for the country to have an effective space programme the space flight programme was abruptly ended due to lack of funds and lessening government response it was during this time the militarization of the space programme took place by prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto when many senior combatant officers were appointed at the administrative position in the space programme many scientists involved in the programme were forcefully transferred to paec and krl to aid the success of the atomic bomb project
in 1981 reforms and re-organization of the space programme was carried out when munir ahmad khan began to rebuild the space infrastructure particularly in rocketry programme which would later form the basis of missile programme on 13 december 1979 munir ahmad khan arranged a meeting at bureaucratic level with president general zia-ul-haq where khan persuaded the countrys bureaucracy to put efforts to re-establish the space programme with an autonomous status without any political influence under taking the advice of munir khan the space programme was again reorganized and appointed nuclear engineer dr salim mehmud from paec as the chairman of suparco the bureaucratization of the suparco took place in 1981 when the secretariat level committee the executive committee of the space research council was established with its members containing the officials from the finance science and economics ministries chaired by the finance minister of the country the committee maintained its bureaucratic control over the space programme and had influence on wide range of policy measure programmes relating the space facilities and financial and scientific development of the rocketry programmes in 1979-80s suparco launched the project to develop countrys first artificial satellite and began sending hundreds of engineers to university of surrey england to participate in the development of uo-11 which was launched in 1984 in 1983 a communication satellite project called paksat was initiated with the establishment of the 10-meter diameter satellite ground station for interception of satellite transmissions was set up that was mainly designed against india according to the scientists involved in this programme the real aim was to launch a satellite that could stage a cultural counter attack on india with the influx of new pakistani media channels but when zia visited suparco all projects were cancelled and abruptly ended the satellite programme citing the lack of funds however munir khan and others pressurized zia to continue the development of the satellite despite zias unwillingnessafter participating in various projects with university of surrey the team of engineers returned to pakistan in 1986 munir ahmad khan then returned to general zia-ul-haq and obtained his approval to begin practical work on badr-i the project was started by suparcos dr salim mehmud as director of the project and was supported by the members of pakistan amateur radio society in short span of time the project badr was completed and the first satellite was named badr-1 in 1990 badr-i — pakistans first locally built satellite — was launched by the china national space administration cnsa of peoples republic of china prc


 1990s orbital slot crises and setbacks 

in  the 1990s the space programme experienced a number of orbital slot crises and failures just like the one experienced in the soviet space program in 1991 suparco launched another satellite project badr-b with the technical assistance provided by the united kingdom the spacecrafts sub-systems were developed and manufactured by pakistan-based desto sil and british rutherford laboratory while the spacecraft integration was performed by suparco the programme was completed in 1994 and it was expected to be launched the same year however the space programme began to suffer much more serious hindrances and lacked the technical assistance to launch the satellite on its own the target to complete the satellite could not be achieved on time and in 1994 plans to launch the spacecraft did not materialise and the launch was halted and delayed long to 2001 unlike its neighbor india which had isro to control over the space programme pakistans space programme was now split between the competition with paec ndc desto paf missile command and the krl despite its success in its space flight programme in the 1960s suparco began to face intense competition from its rival organizations to build the space boosters in the 1980s suparco largely took participation in building the first space booster hatf-i but lost its credibility to krl who derived the space vehicle into an operational missile as early as in 1995 suparci lost its major contract to ndc bureau to develop the countrys first space booster shaheen-i although suparco contributed by building the solid-fuel engine of the rocket and its space launch pad was also used for the spaceflights suparco failed to gain the governments interest in its capabilities and the control of the shaheen expandable programme was handed over to ndc bureau as its executive authorityin 1999 abdul qadeer khan attempted to persuade president pervez musharraf but was unable to convince him to launch the satellite from flight test center with ghauri-i as its space booster in 2001 after long negotiation with the russian federal space agency rka the badr-b took its first successful flight with meteor-3m from the baikonur cosmodrome with ukrainian zenit-2 rocket as its boost launcher although the satellite was operated successfully suparco could not sustain the control of the satellite the suparco suffered a major setback and failure in its satellite programme when the satellite two years after its launch was lost in deep space and failed to reassure its orbital slots and reentry according to sources within suparco the satellite was lost within two years despite its designated life of five years yet no one in suparco really knows what exactly happened to the satellite when contact was lost with it because of the surrounded secrecy and classified status and for propaganda value the details of the missions were covered up and buried deep the government never fully investigated the incidentin 1993 the paksat programme was restarted but unfortunately terminated in 1994 after suparco lost the two orbital slots 38°e longitude and 41°e longitude which was acquired for it in the geo-synchronous orbit in 2002 suparco again applied for the allocation of five gso slots 38°e 41°e 30°e 88°e and 101°e and was filed although granted suparco faced the risk of losing its priority 38°e slot if it did not launch its own satellite by april 2003 being under pressure and understanding the substantial negative impact on the space programme suparco made a move to acquire an american satellite-building firm hughes satellite systems hgs at a cost of around 5 million this second-hand satellite had been originally designed for indonesia but after a battery problem occurred making it useless during certain hours of the day the firm solved the problem and sold the satellite to pakistan as paksat-1


 2000s–2010s recent developments and revitalisation 
in 2000 suparco was brought under the national command authority in order to focus on real development as its chairman maintained under the privileges and opportunities awarded by the economic liberalisation policies of prime minister shaukat aziz suparco pushed herself to gain the support from local government and the private-sectorin 2003 pervez musharraf and shaukat aziz began to forcefully push suparco to pursue and deliver an active space programme funds and government support were increased personally by pervez musharraf as he goaded the space programme as next logical frontier in 2004 suparco launched an ambitious project to develop the countrys first geo-stationary satellite the new project was known as paksat-1replacement in 2007 shaukat aziz paid a state visit to beijing where he successfully persuaded china to join the project and to provide financial assistance to make the project timely successfulin 2005 then-president pervez musharraf outlined his vision for suparco by laying down a clearly defined agenda for the national space agency to pursue and deliver in minimum time musharraf had made it clear that

in 2011 paksat 1r  satellite was launched from china and was deployed successfully at 38°e in the geo-stationary orbit the new satellite took over the existing satellites of the country in orbit despite its initiatives to make the space programme more extended to private-sector it was reportedly revealed by the chairman of suparco in 2012 that despite its initiatives and undertaking numerous development projects and joint ventures but the efforts are seemingly wasted and work suffers from co-ordination failures at the local government levelin july 9th of 2018 china successfully launched two remote sensing satellites for pakistan which were launched to monitor progress as they build the china-pakistan economic corridor the satellites were named prss-1 and paktes-1a and were launched from the jiuquan satellite launch centre in northwest china at 1156 am using a long march-2c rocket the prss-1 is china’s first optical remote sensing satellite sold to pakistan it is the 17th satellite developed by the china academy of space technology for an overseas buyer while paktes-1a is an experimental satellite of space and upper atmosphere research commission it was indigenously designed and solely developed by suparco and is primarily aimed at remote sensing


 test facilities and space centers 
the headquarters of the suparco are located in karachi sindh province near the karachi university while its administrative infrastructure is well developed and expanded all over the country as early as the 1980s suparco joined the international cospas-sarsat programme of soviet union and finally inaugurated the facility at the suparco headquarters known as pakistan mission control center the first commissioning test was carried out from 10 november 2009 at 0500hrsthe suparco plant located near hub a township of coastal balochistan in lasbela the paksat-1r ground control station near pcsir laboratories and ftr flight testing range located in sonmiani also in balochistan near karachi


 notable projects and achievements 


 rehbar spaceflight programme 

on 7 june 1962 at 1953 hours pst the rehbar-i took its first successful spaceflight in deep space from the sonmiani terminal launch the rocket soared to about 130 km into the atmosphere making pakistan the third country in asia and the 10th in the world to conduct such a launch this was followed by the second booster the rehbar-ii which was also successfully launched from sonmiani terminal launch on 9 june 1962 the data received from rehbar-i and rehbar-ii gave scientists information on wind shear and structure of layers of the upper atmosphere extending beyond the stratosphere the successful launch carried a payload of 80 pounds of sodium and it streaked up about 130 km into the atmosphere suparco tested its rehbar rocket series for more than a decade the space flight program was terminated on 8 april 1972


 hatf programme 

the hatf programme was developed with the contribution of the suparcos scientists with collaboration from scientists of the krl the program was developed in extreme secrecy and was finally revealed in 1989 by the pakistan army in january 1989 the rocket made its first maiden spaceflight which was dubbed by the army as indigenous multistage rocket into deep space it was said to have reached an altitude of more than 480 km earlier in 1981 suparco had announced plans to test a launcher by 1986 and the pakistans press reported in early 1989 that a multi-stage rocket had successfully launched a 150-kilogram payload over 600 kilometers into deep space


 shaheen-iii 

suparco which had participated earlier in the development of the shaheen-i began to take research on developing the first space-expandable vehicle in 1998 in march 2001 science advisor to president abdul qadeer khan publicly announced that suparcos scientists were in the process of building the countrys first expendable launch vehicle and that the contract has been awarded to suparco rather than ndcabdul qadeer khan also cited the motivation that india had made rapid advances in launch technology and satellite manufacturing as another motivation for developing indigenous launch capabilities suparcos previous chairman dr abdul majid confirmed khans statement and said pakistan envisions a low-cost satellite rocket-booster in order to launch light-weight satellites into low earth orbits abdul qadeer khan closed his statement by adding that pakistan has very robust irbms which can launch geostationary orbiting satellites all pakistan has to do is to erase delhi or kolkata from the target and point it towards the sky instead of hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs the missiles can easily carry a payload of a satellite during the ideas 2002 journalists took pictures of the two possible and similar models of the satellite launch booster of suparco
it was widely speculated in 2002 by the international media that the country was deriving its missiles into an effective space booster  as most likely the second model might also be based on one of the ballistic missiles operational with pakistan armed forceson 18 august 2009 samar mubarak mand reported that pakistan would launch its own satellite in april 2011 it made some things seem all too obvious to analyst familiar with the subject according to global securityorg it was expected that the satellite would be launched from shaheen-iii booster from an unknown space facility within pakistan however the satellite was launched by using the long march 3b as its vehicle shaheen-iii which was successfully tested on march 9 2015 by pakistan government turned out to be a medium-range ballistic missile it may be possible in the future for suparco to build lightweight satellites and deliver them using a shaheen-iii variant


 satellite-control programmes 
since the early 1960s when the second spaceflight of rehbar-ii weather rocket successfully took place to measure the upper atmosphere the program gradually improved in the 1980s the badr satellite program took place to counter the rohini satellite and was eventually launched by suparco in 1990 in china since then suparco has an active satellite control program and controls various satellites under the mutual agreement with the international community from the pakistan mission control center pmcc located in suparco headquarters


 communication and geosynchronous satellites 


 badr-1a 

in 1986 suparco took initiatives to locally build the countrys first digital communication satellite with the financial support from ministries of telecommunication and science initially the government wanted suparco to hold talks with nasa but after the challenger disaster the us government halted all major spaceflights instead china voluntarily offered pakistan to launch its satellite using its long march 2 rockets in 1990 the satellite was immediately airlifted to china with suparco personnel in july 1990 the nations first satellite was launched from china as badr-1 aboard a long march 2e from xichang satellite launch center china the satellite successfully completed its designed life and it was termed by the government as a key success to suparco


 paksat-1extended 

the paksat program was originally conceived in the 1980s but due to its first technical failure the program was terminated in 1994 in 2003 suparco held talks with hughes space and communications company to lease one of the palapa satellites that it placed in ego-synchronous orbit for indonesia after indonesia publicly declared that the satellite was unusable due to an electric power anomaly the hughes space company paid the insurance claims and sold the satellite to suparco and renamed it as paksat-ie the hgs-3 was then acquired by pakistan from ms hughes global services on full time leasing  and relocated to pakistans reserved slot at 38°east after a series of orbital maneuvers the satellite was stabilized at the final location on 20 december 2002 with 0°inclination the satellite is in position at the pakistan-licensed orbital location 38°east longitude in 2012 the paksat-ie was decommissioned later after the second satellite was launched in 2011


 paksat-1replacement 

on 14 august 2011 paksat-1r was launched by china using long march 3b rocket the 11,000 lb satellite was built by china academy of space technology on dfh-4 space platform this satellite replaced paksat-1e the paksat-1r is a program to support all conventional and modern fixed satellite service fss applications including broadband e-learning telemedicine digital tv and emergency communications the paksat-1r satellite is programmed to control a total of up to 30 transponders 18 in ku-band and 12 in c-band to ensure high degree of reliability and availability of the system suparco has two operational mission control centers which were established in karachi and lahore one to act as the main control facility and the other as backup respectively


 weather and earth observation 


 badr-b 

in 1992 suparco was given orders to develop its first leo-based earth observation satellite according to the director of this program dr abdul majid the satellite was to launch in june 1996 but the orbital crises delayed the launch of satellite and then it was launched on 10 december 2001 at 1719 hours ut pakistan from baikonur cosmodrome kazakhstan aboard a russian zenit-2 rocket
although it was successfully put in orbit by suparco in 2003 but according to internal sources in suparco the satellite ended up in a major disaster in mere two years after its launch despite its five-year designated life the satellite was lost in deep space after it failed to reassure its orbital slot and failed to make its reentry in earths orbit


 remote sensing satellites 

in 2006–07 suparco launched the development on high-resolution and the series of remote-sensing weather satellties to meet the national and international user requirements in the field of satellite imagery this dual purpose remote-sensing and the weather satellite program is known as the prs program and in january 2007 a feasibility and system definition study was concluded by suparco which recommended the launch of an optical and synthetic aperture radar sar satellite to ensure that the domestic and international user requirements are competitively met in july 2007 the development of the first prototype optical satellite in this prs program was launched  the manufacturing of the satellite was planned in the third quarter of year 2008 initially suparco plans to launch an optical satellite with payload of 2.5-meter pan in 700 km sun-synchronous orbit which will be followed by a series of optical and sar satellites in the future the satellite is under development process by suparco and it is expected to be launched in 2014


 planetary sciences and scientific missions 
every year suparco sponsors and organizes the world space week wsw to promote the understanding of the earth science all over the country suparco works with a number of universities and research institutions to engage in research in observational astronomy and astrophysics the institute of space and planetary astrophysics ispa of the karachi university conducts key research and co-sponsors with international level research programs in astrophysics with joint ventures of suparcosuparco continuous development of the space program with particular focus on indigenous self-reliance and introduction of the state-of-the-art technologies suparco also offers its services to the private sector consortium to satisfy the industrial and environmental needs and to support economic competitivenesssuparco operates a national balloon launching facility in karachi to conduct studies in atmospheric sciences to determine the vertical profile of ozone up to 30–35 km this balloon sounding facility has been extensively used for carrying out research in better understanding of the meteorology and how the ozone layer vary seasonally  in the stratosphere and troposphere the ionospheric station at karachi operates an lonosonde observation facility and recently the balloon flight mission was carried out by the station on 16 january 2004 up to an altitude of about 36 km to measure the vertical profile of the o3 trends the maximum o3 observed 12.65 mpa at 27 km one of the most notable mission of suparco is its lunar program that conducts observational studies on the activity of lunar phases and distributes its publications within the public domain
