this is a list of satellites and spacecraft which have been given usa designations by the united states air force these designations have been applied to most us military satellites since 1984 and replaced the earlier ops designation it is comparable to the sovietrussian kosmos designation
as of  december 2018 usa designations have been assigned to 290 space missions note that there is not always a one-to-one mapping between launch vehicles and mission spacecraft this can occasionally result in gaps when maintaining records that incorrectly make that assumption such as the missing entries for usa-163 which are symmetrically contemporary with confusion over splitting spacecraft tracks
