 history 


 prehistory 

archaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited china between 2.24 million and 250,000 years ago the hominid fossils of peking man a homo erectus who used fire were discovered in a cave at zhoukoudian near beijing they have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 years ago the fossilized teeth of homo sapiens dated to 125,000–80,000 years ago have been discovered in fuyan cave in dao county hunan chinese proto-writing existed in jiahu around 7000 bce damaidi around 6000 bce dadiwan from 5800–5400 bce and banpo dating from the 5th millennium bce some scholars have suggested that the jiahu symbols 7th millennium bce constituted the earliest chinese writing system


 early dynastic rule 

according to chinese tradition the first dynasty was the xia which emerged around 2100 bce the dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early bronze age sites at erlitou henan in 1959 it remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period the succeeding shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records the shang ruled the plain of the yellow river in eastern china from the 17th to the 11th century bce their oracle bone script from c 1500 bce represents the oldest form of chinese writing yet found and is a direct ancestor of modern chinese charactersthe shang was conquered by the zhou who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries bce though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords some principalities eventually emerged from the weakened zhou no longer fully obeyed the zhou king and continually waged war with each other in the 300-year spring and autumn period by the time of the warring states period of the 5th–3rd centuries bce there were only seven powerful states left


 imperial china 

the warring states period ended in 221 bce after the state of qin conquered the other six kingdoms reunited china and established the dominant order of totalitarian autocracy king zheng of qin proclaimed himself the first emperor of the qin dynasty he enacted qins legalist reforms throughout china notably the forced standardization of chinese characters measurements road widths ie cart axles length and currency his dynasty also conquered the yue tribes in guangxi guangdong and vietnam the qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years falling soon after the first emperors death as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellionfollowing a widespread civil war during which the imperial library at xianyang was burned the han dynasty emerged to rule china between 206 bce and ce 220 creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the han chinese the han expanded the empires territory considerably with military campaigns reaching central asia mongolia south korea and yunnan and the recovery of guangdong and northern vietnam from nanyue han involvement in central asia and sogdia helped establish the land route of the silk road replacing the earlier path over the himalayas to india han china gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world despite the hans initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the qin philosophy of legalism in favor of confucianism qins legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the han government and its successors

after the end of the han dynasty a period of strife known as three kingdoms followed whose central figures were later immortalized in one of the four classics of chinese literature at its end wei was swiftly overthrown by the jin dynasty the jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally-disabled emperor the five barbarians then invaded and ruled northern china as the sixteen states the xianbei unified them as the northern wei whose emperor xiaowen reversed his predecessors apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects largely integrating them into chinese culture in the south the general liu yu secured the abdication of the jin in favor of the liu song the various successors of these states became known as the northern and southern dynasties with the two areas finally reunited by the sui in 581 the sui restored the han to power through china reformed its agriculture and economy constructed the grand canal and patronized buddhism however they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war in northern korea provoked widespread unrestunder the succeeding tang and song dynasties chinese economy technology and culture entered a golden age the tang empire returned control of the western regions and the silk road and made the capital changan a cosmopolitan urban center however it was devastated and weakened by the an shi rebellion in the 8th century in 907 the tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable the song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960 leading to a balance of power between the song and khitan liao the song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade

between the 10th and 11th centuries the population of china doubled in size to around 100 million people mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern china and the production of abundant food surpluses the song dynasty also saw a revival of confucianism in response to the growth of buddhism during the tang and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity however the military weakness of the song army was observed by the jurchen jin dynasty in 1127 emperor huizong of song and the capital bianjing were captured during the jin–song wars the remnants of the song retreated to southern chinathe 13th century brought the mongol conquest of china in 1271 the mongol leader kublai khan established the yuan dynasty the yuan conquered the last remnant of the song dynasty in 1279 before the mongol invasion the population of song china was 120 million citizens this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300 a peasant named zhu yuanzhang overthrew the yuan in 1368 and founded the ming dynasty as the hongwu emperor under the ming dynasty china enjoyed another golden age developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture it was during this period that admiral zheng he led the ming treasure voyages throughout the indian ocean reaching as far as east africain the early years of the ming dynasty chinas capital was moved from nanjing to beijing with the budding of capitalism philosophers such as wang yangming further critiqued and expanded neo-confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations the scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements which together with the famines and defense against japanese invasions of korea 1592–98 and manchu invasions led to an exhausted treasuryin 1644 beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by li zicheng the chongzhen emperor committed suicide when the city fell the manchu qing dynasty then allied with ming dynasty general wu sangui overthrew lis short-lived shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of beijing which became the new capital of the qing dynasty


 end of dynastic rule 

the qing dynasty which lasted from 1644 until 1912 was the last imperial dynasty of china its conquest of the ming 1618–1683 cost 25 million lives and the economy of china shrank drastically after the southern ming ended the further conquest of the dzungar khanate added mongolia tibet and xinjiang to the empire the centralized autocracy was strengthened to crack down on anti-qing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce the haijin sea ban and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition causing social and technological stagnation in the mid-19th century the dynasty experienced western imperialism in the opium wars with britain and france china was forced to pay compensation open treaty ports allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals and cede hong kong to the british under the 1842 treaty of nanking the first of the unequal treaties the first sino-japanese war 1894–95 resulted in qing chinas loss of influence in the korean peninsula as well as the cession of taiwan to japan

the qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died especially in the white lotus rebellion the failed taiping rebellion that ravaged southern china in the 1850s and 1860s and the dungan revolt 1862–77 in the northwest the initial success of the self-strengthening movement of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s
in the 19th century the great chinese diaspora began losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the northern chinese famine of 1876–79 in which between 9 and 13 million people died the guangxu emperor drafted a reform plan in 1898 to establish a modern constitutional monarchy but these plans were thwarted by the empress dowager cixi the ill-fated anti-foreign boxer rebellion of 1899–1901 further weakened the dynasty although cixi sponsored a program of reforms the xinhai revolution of 1911–12 brought an end to the qing dynasty and established the republic of china


 republic of china 1912–1949 

on 1 january 1912 the republic of china was established and sun yat-sen of the kuomintang the kmt or nationalist party was proclaimed provisional president however the presidency was later given to yuan shikai a former qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself emperor of china in the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own beiyang army he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic

after yuan shikais death in 1916 china was politically fragmented its beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless regional warlords controlled most of its territory in the late 1920s the kuomintang under chiang kai-shek the then principal of the republic of china military academy was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political maneuverings known collectively as the northern expedition the kuomintang moved the nations capital to nanjing and implemented political tutelage an intermediate stage of political development outlined in sun yat-sens san-min program for transforming china into a modern democratic state the political division in china made it difficult for chiang to battle the communist peoples liberation army pla against whom the kuomintang had been warring since 1927 in the chinese civil war this war continued successfully for the kuomintang especially after the pla retreated in the long march until japanese aggression and the 1936 xian incident forced chiang to confront imperial japan

the second sino-japanese war 1937–1945 a theater of world war ii forced an uneasy alliance between the kuomintang and the pla japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population in all as many as 20 million chinese civilians died an estimated 200,000 chinese were massacred in the city of nanjing alone during the japanese occupation during the war china along with the uk the us and the soviet union were referred to as trusteeship of the powerful and were recognized as the allied big four in the declaration by united nations along with the other three great powers china was one of the four major allies of world war ii and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war after the surrender of japan in 1945 taiwan including the pescadores was returned to chinese control china emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained the continued distrust between the kuomintang and the communists led to the resumption of civil war constitutional rule was established in 1947 but because of the ongoing unrest many provisions of the roc constitution were never implemented in mainland china


 peoples republic of china 1949–present 

major combat in the chinese civil war ended in 1949 with the communist party in control of most of mainland china and the kuomintang retreating offshore reducing the rocs territory to only taiwan hainan and their surrounding islands on 21 september 1949 communist party chairman mao zedong proclaimed the establishment of the peoples republic of china this was followed by a mass celebration in tiananmen square on 1 october which became the new countrys first national day in 1950 the peoples liberation army succeeded in capturing hainan from the roc and incorporating tibet however remaining kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western china throughout the 1950s in modern us history studies the founding of prc china is often termed as the loss of china as reflected in us state policy documents of the time which thinkers such as noam chomsky call the beginning of mccarthyismthe regime consolidated its popularity among the peasants through land reform which included the execution of between 1 and 2 million landlords china developed an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons the chinese population increased from 550 million in 1950 to 900 million in 1974 however the great leap forward a large-scale economic and social reform project resulted in an estimated 45 million deaths between 1958 and 1961 mostly from starvation in 1966 mao and his allies launched the cultural revolution sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval which lasted until maos death in 1976 in october 1971 the prc replaced the republic of china in the united nations and took its seat as a permanent member of the security councilafter maos death the gang of four was quickly arrested and held responsible for the excesses of the cultural revolution deng xiaoping took power in 1978 and instituted significant economic reforms the communist party loosened governmental control over citizens personal lives and the communes were gradually disbanded in favor of working contracted to households this marked chinas transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open-market environment china adopted its current constitution on 4 december 1982 in 1989 the violent suppression of student protests in tiananmen square brought sanctions against the chinese government from various countriesjiang zemin li peng and zhu rongji led the nation in the 1990s under their administration chinas economic performance pulled an estimated 150 million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11.2 the country formally joined the world trade organization in 2001 and maintained its high rate of economic growth under hu jintao and wen jiabaos leadership in the 2000s however rapid growth also severely impacted the countrys resources and environment and caused major social displacement living standards continued to improve rapidly despite the late-2000s recession but centralized political control remained tightpreparations for a decadal communist party leadership change in 2012 were marked by factional disputes and political scandals during chinas 18th national communist party congress in november 2012 hu jintao was replaced as general secretary of the communist party by xi jinping under xi the chinese government began large-scale efforts to reform its economy which has suffered from structural instabilities and slowing growth the xi–li administration also announced major reforms to the one-child policy and prison system


 geography 

chinas landscape is vast and diverse ranging from the gobi and taklamakan deserts in the arid north to subtropical forests in the wetter south the himalaya karakoram pamir and tian shan mountain ranges separate china from much of south and central asia the yangtze and yellow rivers the third- and sixth-longest in the world respectively run from the tibetan plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard chinas coastline along the pacific ocean is 14,500 kilometers 9,000 mi long and is bounded by the bohai yellow east china and south china seas china connects through the kazakh border to the eurasian steppe which has been an artery of communication between east and west since the neolithic through the steppe route – the ancestor of the terrestrial silk roads


 landscape and climate 

the territory of china lies between latitudes 18° and 54° n and longitudes 73° and 135° e chinas landscapes vary significantly across its vast width in the east along the shores of the yellow sea and the east china sea there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains while on the edges of the inner mongolian plateau in the north broad grasslands predominate southern china is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges while the central-east hosts the deltas of chinas two major rivers the yellow river and the yangtze river other major rivers include the xi mekong brahmaputra and amur to the west sit major mountain ranges most notably the himalayas high plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north such as the taklamakan and the gobi desert the worlds highest point mount everest 8,848m lies on the sino-nepalese border the countrys lowest point and the worlds third-lowest is the dried lake bed of ayding lake −154m in the turpan depressionchinas climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer in the winter northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry in summer southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist the climate in china differs from region to region because of the countrys highly complex topography

a major environmental issue in china is the continued expansion of its deserts particularly the gobi desert although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern china each spring which then spread to other parts of east asia including korea and japan chinas environmental watchdog sepa stated in 2007 that china is losing 4,000 km2 1,500 sq mi per year to desertification water quality erosion and pollution control have become important issues in chinas relations with other countries melting glaciers in the himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of people

 environmental issues 

in recent decades china has suffered from severe environmental deterioration and pollution while regulations such as the 1979 environmental protection law are fairly stringent they are poorly enforced as they are frequently disregarded by local communities and government officials in favor of rapid economic development urban air pollution is a severe health issue in the country the world bank estimated in 2013 that 16 of the worlds 20 most-polluted cities are located in china and china is the country with the highest death toll because of air pollution there are 1.14 million deaths caused by exposure to ambient air pollution china is the worlds largest carbon dioxide emitter the country also has significant water pollution problems 40% of chinas rivers had been polluted by industrial and agricultural waste by late 2011 in 2014 the internal freshwater resources per capita of china reduced to 2,062m3 and it was below 500m3 in the north china plain while 5,920m3 in the worldin china heavy metals also cause environmental pollution heavy metal pollution is an inorganic chemical hazard which is mainly caused by lead pb chromium cr arsenic as cadmium cd mercury hg zinc zn copper cu cobalt co and nickel ni five metals among them pb cr as cd and hg are the key heavy metal pollutants in china heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining sewage irrigation the manufacturing of metal-containing products and other related production activities high level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities including reading and learning disabilities behavioral problems hearing loss attention problems and disruption in the development of visual and motor function according to the data of a national census of pollution china has more than 1.5 million sites of heavy metals exposure the total volume of discharged heavy metals in the waste water waste gas and solid wastes are around 900,000 tons each year from 2005–2011however china is the worlds leading investor in renewable energy and its commercialization with 52 billion invested in 2011 alone it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in local-scale renewable energy projects by 2015 over 24% of chinas energy was derived from renewable sources while most notably from hydroelectric power a total installed capacity of 197 gw makes china the largest hydroelectric power producer in the world china also has the largest power capacity of installed solar photovoltaics system and wind power system in the world in 2011 the chinese government announced plans to invest four trillion yuan us619 billion in water infrastructure and desalination projects over a ten-year period and to complete construction of a flood prevention and anti-drought system by 2020 in 2013 china began a five-year us277 billion effort to reduce air pollution particularly in the north of the country

 politics 

chinas constitution states that the peoples republic of china is a socialist state under the peoples democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants and that the state organs apply the principle of democratic centralism the prc is one of the worlds only socialist states openly endorsing communism see ideology of the communist party of china the chinese government has been variously described as communist and socialist but also as authoritarian and corporatist with heavy restrictions in many areas most notably against free access to the internet freedom of the press freedom of assembly the right to have children free formation of social organizations and freedom of religion its current political ideological and economic system has been termed by its leaders as the peoples democratic dictatorship socialism with chinese characteristics which is marxism adapted to chinese circumstances and the socialist market economy respectively


 communist party 

chinas constitution declares that the country is ruled under the leadership of the communist party of china cpc as china is a de facto one-party state the general secretary party leader holds ultimate power and authority over state and government serving as the paramount leader the electoral system is pyramidal local peoples congresses are directly elected and higher levels of peoples congresses up to the national peoples congress npc are indirectly elected by the peoples congress of the level immediately below the political system is decentralized and provincial and sub-provincial leaders have a significant amount of autonomy another eight political parties have representatives in the npc and the chinese peoples political consultative conference cppcc china supports the leninist principle of democratic centralism but critics describe the elected national peoples congress as a rubber stamp body

china considers taiwan to be its 23rd province although taiwan is governed by the republic of china which rejects the prcs claim none of the divisions are recognized by the roc government which claims the entirety of the prcs territory


 foreign relations 

the prc has diplomatic relations with 175 countries and maintains embassies in 162 its legitimacy is disputed by the republic of china and a few other countries it is thus the largest and most populous state with limited recognition in 1971 the prc replaced the republic of china as the sole representative of china in the united nations and as one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council china was also a former member and leader of the non-aligned movement and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries along with brazil russia india and south africa china is a member of the brics group of emerging major economies and hosted the groups third official summit at sanya hainan in april 2011

under its interpretation of the one-china policy beijing has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to taiwan and severs official ties with the government of the republic of china chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to taiwan especially in the matter of armament sales

much of current chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on premier zhou enlais five principles of peaceful coexistence and is also driven by the concept of harmony without uniformity which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences this policy may have led china to support states that are regarded as dangerous or repressive by western nations such as zimbabwe north korea and iran china has a close economic and military relationship with russia and the two states often vote in unison in the un security council

 territorial disputes 

ever since its establishment after the second chinese civil war the prc has claimed the territories governed by the republic of china roc a separate political entity today commonly known as taiwan as a part of its territory it regards the island of taiwan as its taiwan province kinmen and matsu as a part of fujian province and islands the roc controls in the south china sea as a part of hainan province and guangdong province these claims are controversial because of the complicated cross-strait relations with the prc treating the one-china policy as one of its most important diplomatic principlesin addition to taiwan china is also involved in other international territorial disputes since the 1990s china has been involved in negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders including a disputed border with india and an undefined border with bhutan china is additionally involved in multilateral disputes over the ownership of several small islands in the east and south china seas such as the senkaku islands and the scarborough shoal on 21 may 2014 xi jinping speaking at a conference in shanghai pledged to settle chinas territorial disputes peacefully china stays committed to seeking peaceful settlement of disputes with other countries over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests he said

the chinese democracy movement social activists and some members of the communist party of china have all identified the need for social and political reform while economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in china since the 1970s political freedom is still tightly restricted the constitution of the peoples republic of china states that the fundamental rights of citizens include freedom of speech freedom of the press the right to a fair trial freedom of religion universal suffrage and property rights however in practice these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling communist party are tolerated censorship of political speech and information most notably on the internet are routinely used to prevent collective action in 2005 reporters without borders ranked china 159th out of 167 states in its annual world press freedom index indicating a very low level of press freedom in 2014 china ranked 175th out of 180 countriesrural migrants to chinas cities often find themselves treated as second class citizens by the hukou household registration system which controls access to state benefits property rights are often poorly protected and taxation disproportionately affects poorer citizens however a number of rural taxes have been reduced or abolished since the early 2000s and additional social services provided to rural dwellersa number of foreign governments foreign press agencies and ngos also routinely criticize chinas human rights record alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial forced abortions forced confessions torture restrictions of fundamental rights and excessive use of the death penalty the government suppresses popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to social stability as was the case with the tiananmen square protests of 1989

 economy 

china had the largest economy in the world for most of the past two thousand years during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline since economic reforms began in 1978 china has developed into a highly diversified economy and one of the most consequential players in international trade major sectors of competitive strength include manufacturing retail mining steel textiles automobiles energy generation green energy banking electronics telecommunications real estate e-commerce and tourism in 2018 china had 9 out of the top 20 most valuable internet companies in the world in 2019 the chinese retail market is expected to overtake that of the us and become 1 in the world china leads the world in e-commerce accounting for 40% of the global market share china is the leader in electric vehicles manufacturing and buying half of all the plug-in electric cars bev and phev in the world in 2018 china had 174 gw of installed solar capacity by the end of 2018 which amounts to more than 40% of the global capacity as of 2018 china had the worlds second-largest economy in terms of nominal gdp totaling approximately us13.5 trillion 90 trillion yuan in terms of purchasing power parity ppp gdp chinas economy has been the largest in the world since 2014 according to the world bank as of 2018 china was second in the world in total number of billionaires and millionaires -- there were 338 chinese billionaires and 3.5 million millionaires however it ranks behind over 70 countries out of around 180 in per capita economic output making it a middle income country additionally its development is highly uneven its major cities and coastal areas are far more prosperous compared to rural and interior regions china brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history -- between 1978 and 2018 china reduced extreme poverty by 800 million and reduced the extreme poverty rate -- per international standard it refers to an income of less than 1.90day -- from 88% in 1981 to 1.85% by 2013according to the world bank the number of chinese in extreme poverty fell from 756 million to 25 million between 1990 and 2013 chinas own national poverty standards are higher and thus the national poverty rates were 3.1% in 2017 and 1% in 2018


 economic history and growth 

from its founding in 1949 until late 1978 the peoples republic of china was a soviet-style centrally planned economy following maos death in 1976 and the consequent end of the cultural revolution deng xiaoping and the new chinese leadership began to reform the economy and move towards a more market-oriented mixed economy under one-party rule agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized while foreign trade became a major new focus leading to the creation of special economic zones sezs inefficient state-owned enterprises soes were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright resulting in massive job losses modern-day china is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership and is one of the leading examples of state capitalism the state still dominates in strategic pillar sectors such as energy production and heavy industries but private enterprise has expanded enormously with around 30 million private businesses recorded in 2008 in 2018 private enterprises in china accounted for 60% of gdp 80% of urban employment and 90% of new jobs

in 2015 chinas middle class became the largest in the world since economic liberalization began in 1978 china has been among the worlds fastest-growing economies relying largely on investment- and export-led growth according to the imf chinas annual average gdp growth between 2001 and 2010 was 10.5 in the years immediately following the financial crisis of 2007 chinas economic growth rate was equivalent to all of the g7 countries growth combined according to the global growth generators index announced by citigroup in february 2011 china has a very high 3g growth rating its high productivity low labor costs and relatively good infrastructure have made it a global leader in manufacturing china ranks 1 in the production of steel aluminum and automobiles -- chinas global market shares are 50% in steel 50% in aluminum and 30% in automobile manufacturing china has also been increasingly turning to automation becoming the worlds largest market for industrial robots in 2013 between 2010 and 2015 china installed 90,000 industrial robots or one-third of the worlds total in 2017 china bought 36% of all the new industrial robots in the world chinas plan is to also domestically design and manufacture 100,000 industrial robots by 2020 however the chinese economy is highly energy-intensive and inefficient china became the worlds largest energy consumer in 2010 relies on coal to supply over 70% of its energy needs and surpassed the us to become the worlds largest oil importer in 2013 in the last decade china has become 1 in the world in terms of installed solar power capacity hydro-power and wind power according to the world economic forum china will account for 40% of the global renewable energy by 2022 in addition official gdp figures are seen as unreliable and there have been several well-publicized cases of data manipulation in the early 2010s chinas economic growth rate began to slow amid domestic credit troubles weakening international demand for chinese exports and fragility in the global economy chinas gdp was smaller than germanys in 2007 however by 2017 chinas 12.2 trillion-economy became larger than those of germany uk france and italy combined in 2018 the imf reiterated its forecast that china will overtake the us in terms of nominal gdp by the year 2030 economists also expect chinas middle class to expand to 600 million people by 2025

 china in the global economy 
china is a member of the wto and is the worlds largest trading power with a total international trade value of us3.87 trillion in 2012 its foreign exchange reserves reached us2.85 trillion by the end of 2010 an increase of 18.7% over the previous year making its reserves by far the worlds largest in 2012 china was the worlds largest recipient of inward foreign direct investment fdi attracting 253 billion in 2014 chinas foreign exchange remittances were us64 billion making it the second largest recipient of remittances in the world china also invests abroad with a total outward fdi of 62.4 billion in 2012 and a number of major takeovers of foreign firms by chinese companies china is a major owner of us public debt holding trillions of dollars worth of us treasury bonds chinas undervalued exchange rate has caused friction with other major economies and it has also been widely criticized for manufacturing large quantities of counterfeit goods

china ranks 28th out of 140 countries in the global competitiveness index above many advanced economies and making it by far the most competitive major emerging economy this is largely owing to its strength in infrastructure and wide adoption of communication and information technology however it lags behind advanced economies in labour market efficiency institutional strength and openness of market competition especially for foreign players attempting to enter the domestic market in 2018 fortunes global 500 list of the worlds largest corporations included 120 chinese companies many of the largest public companies in the world were chinese including the worlds largest bank by total assets the industrial and commercial bank of chinafollowing the 2007-8 financial crisis chinese authorities sought to actively wean off of its dependence on the us dollar as a result of perceived weaknesses of the international monetary system to achieve those ends china took a series of actions to further the internationalization of the renminbi in 2008 china established dim sum bond market and expanded the cross-border trade rmb settlement pilot project which helps establish pools of offshore rmb liquidity this was followed with bilateral agreements to settle trades directly in renminbi with russia japan australia singapore the united kingdom and canada as a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi it became the eighth-most-traded currency in the world an emerging international reserve currency and a component of the imfs special drawing rights however partly due to capital controls that make the renminbi fall short of being a fully convertible currency it remains far behind the euro dollar and japanese yen in international trade volumes

 demographics 

the national census of 2010 recorded the population of the peoples republic of china as approximately 1,370,536,875 about 16.60% of the population were 14 years old or younger 70.14% were between 15 and 59 years old and 13.26% were over 60 years old the population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 0.46china used to make up much of the world’s poor now china makes up much of the world’s middle class although a middle-income country by western standards chinas rapid growth has pulled hundreds of millions -- 800 million to be more precise -- of its people out of poverty since 1978 by 2013 less than 2% of the chinese population lived below the international poverty line of us1.9 per day down from 88% in 1981 chinas own standards for poverty are higher and still the country is on its way to eradicate national poverty completely by 2019 from 2009-2018 the unemployment rate in china has averaged about 4given concerns about population growth china implemented a two-child limit during the 1970s and in 1979 began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family beginning in the mid 1980s however given the unpopularity of the strict limits china began to allow some major exemptions particularly in rural areas resulting in what was actually a 1.5-child policy from the mid-1980s to 2015 ethnic minorities were also exempt from one child limits the next major loosening of the policy was enacted in december 2013 allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child in 2016 the one-child policy was replaced in favor of a two-child policy data from the 2010 census implies that the total fertility rate may be around 1.4 although due to underreporting of births it may be closer to 1.5–1.6according to one group of scholars one-child limits had little effect on population growth or the size of the total population however these scholars have been challenged their own counterfactual model of fertility decline without such restrictions implies that china averted more than 500 million births between 1970 and 2015 a number which may reach one billion by 2060 given all the lost descendants of births averted during the era of fertility restrictions with one-child restrictions accounting for the great bulk of that reductionthe policy along with traditional preference for boys may have contributed to an imbalance in the sex ratio at birth according to the 2010 census the sex ratio at birth was 118.06 boys for every 100 girls which is beyond the normal range of around 105 boys for every 100 girls the 2010 census found that males accounted for 51.27 percent of the total population however chinas sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953 when males accounted for 51.82 percent of the total population

the national health and family planning commission together with its counterparts in the local commissions oversees the health needs of the chinese population an emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized chinese health policy since the early 1950s at that time the communist party started the patriotic health campaign which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene as well as treating and preventing several diseases diseases such as cholera typhoid and scarlet fever which were previously rife in china were nearly eradicated by the campaign after deng xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978 the health of the chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared along with the peoples communes healthcare in china became mostly privatized and experienced a significant rise in quality in 2009 the government began a 3-year large-scale healthcare provision initiative worth us124 billion by 2011 the campaign resulted in 95% of chinas population having basic health insurance coverage in 2011 china was estimated to be the worlds third-largest supplier of pharmaceuticals but its population has suffered from the development and distribution of counterfeit medicationsas of  2012 the average life expectancy at birth in china is 75 years and the infant mortality rate is 12 per thousand both have improved significantly since the 1950s rates of stunting a condition caused by malnutrition have declined from 33.1% in 1990 to 9.9% in 2010 despite significant improvements in health and the construction of advanced medical facilities china has several emerging public health problems such as respiratory illnesses caused by widespread air pollution hundreds of millions of cigarette smokers and an increase in obesity among urban youths chinas large population and densely populated cities have led to serious disease outbreaks in recent years such as the 2003 outbreak of sars although this has since been largely contained in 2010 air pollution caused 1.2 million premature deaths in china


 religion 

the government of the peoples republic of china officially espouses state atheism and has conducted antireligious campaigns to this end religious affairs and issues in the country are overseen by the state administration for religious affairs freedom of religion is guaranteed by chinas constitution although religious organizations that lack official approval can be subject to state persecution

over the millennia chinese civilization has been influenced by various religious movements the three teachings including confucianism taoism and buddhism chinese buddhism historically have a significant role in shaping chinese culture enriching a theological and spiritual framework which harkens back to the early shang and zhou dynasty chinese popular or folk religion which is framed by the three teachings and other traditions consists in allegiance to the shen 神 a character that signifies the energies of generation who can be deities of the environment or ancestral principles of human groups concepts of civility culture heroes many of whom feature in chinese mythology and history among the most popular cults are those of mazu goddess of the seas huangdi one of the two divine patriarchs of the chinese race guandi god of war and business caishen god of prosperity and richness pangu and many others china is home to many of the worlds tallest religious statues including the tallest of all the spring temple buddha in henan
clear data on religious affiliation in china is difficult to gather due to varying definitions of religion and the unorganized diffusive nature of chinese religious traditions scholars note that in china there is no clear boundary between three teachings religions buddhism taoism and local folk religious practice a 2015 poll conducted by gallup international found that 61% of chinese people self-identified as convinced atheist though it is worthwhile to note that chinese religions or some of their strands are definable as non-theistic and humanistic religions since they do not believe that divine creativity is completely transcendent but it is inherent in the world and in particular in the human being according to a 2014 study approximately 74% are either non-religious or practise chinese folk belief 16% are buddhists 2% are christians 1% are muslims and 8% adhere to other religions including taoists and folk salvationism in addition to han peoples local religious practices there are also various ethnic minority groups in china who maintain their traditional autochthone religions the various folk religions today comprise 2–3% of the population while confucianism as a religious self-identification is common within the intellectual class significant faiths specifically connected to certain ethnic groups include tibetan buddhism and the islamic religion of the hui uyghur kazakh kyrgyz and other peoples in northwest china
