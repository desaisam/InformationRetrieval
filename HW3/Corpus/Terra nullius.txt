terra nullius  plural terrae nullius is a latin expression meaning nobodys land and was a principle sometimes used in international law to justify claims that territory may be acquired by a states occupation of it


 history 
terra nullius stems from the roman law term res nullius meaning nobodys thing according to the roman law res nullius or things without an owner such as wild animals ferae beastiae lost slaves and abandoned buildings could be taken as property by anyone by seizure
a part of the debate over the history of terra nullius is when the term itself was first used according to historian of ideas andrew fitzmaurice territorium nullius and terra nullius were two different albeit related legal terms he claims that territorium nullius was first used in a meeting of the institut de droit international in 1888 where the legal principles of the berlin conference discussed and that terra nullius was introduced twenty years later during legal disputes over the polar regions historian michael connor on the other hand argues that territorium nullius and terra nullius are the same thing both scholars are active in the australian history wars debate
there is considerable debate among historians about how and when the terra nullius concepts were used the debate has been especially prevalent in australia where it was ignited by the history wars caused by the mabo case in 1992 the history wars caused australian historians to reevaluate the countrys history the dispossession of aborigines and whether the land should best be characterized as having been settled or conquered a part of this debate concerned whether terra nullius as a concept was ever used by england and other european powers to justify territorial conquest
on one side of the debate are historians such as alan frost and henry reynolds who claims that in the 15th and 16th century european writers adopted the res nullius concept for territorial conquest frost writes

by the mid–eighteenth century the theoretical basis of a new convention of acquiring empire had emerged if a european state a christian prince had already established an effective possession of a region another might acquire title to it only by formal cession which might or might not involve outright purchase if the region was not already possessed by a rival then a state might acquire it in one of three ways viz – by persuading the indigenous inhabitants to submit themselves to its overlordship – by purchasing from those inhabitants the right to settle part or parts of it – by unilateral possession on the basis of first discovery and effective occupation
historians debate whether first discovery and effective occupation was applied to territory inhabited by indigenous people that european empires sought to acquire or not according to frost

however if the indigenes had advanced beyond the state of nature only so far as to have developed language and the community of the family but no further if they had not yet mixed their labour with the earth in any permanent way or if the region were literally uninhabited then europeans considered it to be terra nullius ie belonging to no one to which they might gain permanent title by first discovery and effective occupation
on the other side of the debate are historians which claim that terra nullius is a much younger concept which did not become formalized before the end of the 19th century historian merete borch writes

when the wealth of material relevant to this issue is surveyed it seems much more likely that there was no legal doctrine maintaining that inhabited land could be regarded as ownerless nor was this the basis of official policy in the eighteenth century or before rather it seems to have developed as a legal theory in the nineteenth century
these historians claim instead that territorial conquest was justified from natural law — that which has no owner can be taken by the first taker michael connor in his book the invention of terra nullius takes an even more extreme view and argues that no one in the 19th century thought of australia as being terra nullius  he calls the concept a legal fiction a straw man developed in the late 20th century

by the time of mabo in 1992 terra nullius was the only explanation for the british settlement of australia historians more interested in politics than archives misled the legal profession into believing that a phrase no one had heard of a few years before was the very basis of our statehood and reynolds version of our history especially the law of the land underpinned the mabo judges decision-making


 current claims of terra nullius 

few territories are currently considered terra nullius


 bir tawil 
bir tawil is an example of a territory often claimed to be terra nullius between egypt and sudan is the 2,060 km2 800 sq mi landlocked territory of bir tawil which was created by a discrepancy between borders drawn in 1899 and 1903  one border placed bir tawil under sudans control and the halaib triangle under egypts the other border did the reverse  both countries assert the border that lets them claim the halaib triangle which is significantly larger than bir tawil and next to the red sea with the side effect that bir tawil is unclaimed by either nation the area is however under the de facto control of egypt although it is not shown on official egyptian maps bir tawil has no settled population but the land is used by bedouins who roam the area


 gornja siga and other pockets 

serbia and croatia dispute several small areas on the east bank of the danube however some pockets on the west bank of which gornja siga is the largest are not claimed by either country since croatia recognizes that they belong to serbia but serbia doesnt claim them
on 13 april 2015 vít jedlička from the czech party of free citizens proclaimed the right-libertarian micronation of liberland on gornja siga shortly after liberland another micronation project the kingdom of enclava was declared eventually claiming part of the second largest pocket as their territory  the confederation of autia has claimed all the other pockets the croatian ministry of foreign and european affairs has rejected these claims stating that the differing border claims between serbia and croatia do not involve terra nullius and are not subject to occupation by a third party however the serbian ministry of foreign affairs stated on 24 april 2015 that while serbia does not consider liberland to be an important matter the new state does not impinge upon the serbian border which is delineated by the danube river


 antarctica 

while several countries have made claims to parts of antarctica in the first half of the 20th century the remainder including most of marie byrd land the portion east from 150°w to 90°w has not been claimed by any sovereign nation signatories to the antarctic treaty of 1959 agreed not to make such claims except the soviet union and the united states who reserved the right to make a claim


 historical claims of terra nullius 
several territories have been claimed to be terra nullius in a minority of those claims international and domestic courts have ruled on whether the territory is or was terra nullius or not


 australia 
australian aborigines had inhabited australia for over 65,000 years before european settlement which commenced in 1788  indigenous customs rituals and laws were unwritten it has been claimed that australia was considered terra nullius at the time of settlement
in 1971 in the controversial case of milirrpum v nabalco pty ltd popularly known as the gove land rights case justice richard blackburn ruled that australia had been considered desert and uncultivated a term which included territory in which resided uncivilized inhabitants in a primitive state of society before european settlement and therefore by the law that applied at the time open to be claimed by right of occupancy and that there was no such thing as native title in australian law the concept of terra nullius was not considered in this case however court cases in 1977 1979 and 1982 – brought by or on behalf of aboriginal activists – challenged australian sovereignty on the grounds that terra nullius had been improperly applied therefore aboriginal sovereignty should still be regarded as being intact the courts rejected these cases but the australian high court left the door open for a reassessment of whether the continent should be considered settled or conquered later on 1 february 2014 the traditional owners of land on badu island received freehold title to 10,000 hectare in an act of the queensland governmentin 1982 eddie mabo and four other torres strait islanders from mer murray island started legal proceedings to establish their traditional land ownership this led to mabo v queensland no 1 in 1992 after ten years of hearings before the queensland supreme court and the high court of australia the latter court found that the mer people had owned their land prior to annexation by queensland
the ruling thus had far-reaching significance for the land claims of both torres strait islanders and other indigenous australians
the controversy over australian land ownership erupted into the so-called history wars the 1992 mabo decision overturned the doctrine of terra nullius in australia


 svalbard 
scotland or great britain the netherlands and denmark–norway all claimed sovereignty over the archipelago of svalbard in the seventeenth century but none permanently occupied it expeditions from each of these polities visited svalbard principally during the summer for whaling with the first two sending a few wintering parties in the 1620s and 1630sduring the 19th century both norway and russia made strong claims to the archipelago in 1909 italian jurist camille piccioni described spitzbergen as it was then known as terra nullius

the issue would have been simpler if spitzbergen until now terra nullius could have been attributed to a single state for reasons of neighbouring or earlier occupation but this is not the case and several powers can for different reasons make their claims to this territory which still has no master
the territorial dispute was eventually resolved by the svalbard treaty of 9 february 1920 which recognized norwegian sovereignty over the islands


 eastern greenland 
norway occupied and claimed parts of then uninhabited eastern greenland in 1931 claiming that it constituted terra nullius and calling the territory erik the reds land

 canada
