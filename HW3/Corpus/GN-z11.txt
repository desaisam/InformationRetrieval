gn-z11 is a high-redshift galaxy found in the constellation ursa major gn-z11 is currently the oldest and most distant known galaxy in the observable universe gn-z11 has a spectroscopic redshift of z  11.09 which corresponds to a proper distance of approximately 32 billion light-years 9.8 billion parsecsthe objects name is derived from its location in the goods-north field of galaxies and its high cosmological redshift number gn  z11 gn-z11 is observed as it existed 13.4 billion years ago just 400 million years after the big bang as a result gn-z11s distance is sometimes inappropriately reported as 13.4 billion light years its light travel distance measurement


 discovery 
the galaxy was identified by a team studying data from the hubble space telescopes cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey candels and spitzer space telescopes great observatories origins deep survey-north goods-north the research team used hubbles wide field camera 3 to measure the distance to gn-z11 spectroscopically by splitting the light into its component colors to measure the redshift caused by the expansion of the universe the findings which were announced in march 2016 revealed the galaxy to be farther away than originally thought at the distance limit of what the hubble telescope can observe gn-z11 is around 150 million years older than the previous record-holder egsy8p7 and is observed shortly after but very close to the end of the so-called dark ages of the universe and during but near the very beginning of the reionization eracompared with the milky way galaxy gn-z11 is ​1⁄25 of the size has 1% of the mass and is forming new stars approximately twenty times as fast with a stellar age estimated at 40 million years it appears the galaxy formed its stars relatively rapidly the fact that a galaxy so massive existed so soon after the first stars started to form is a challenge to some current theoretical models of the formation of galaxies
