maritime history is the study of human interaction with and activity at sea it covers a broad thematic element of history that often uses a global approach although national and regional histories remain predominant as an academic subject it often crosses the boundaries of standard disciplines focusing on understanding humankinds various relationships to the oceans seas and major waterways of the globe nautical history records and interprets past events involving ships shipping navigation and seafarersmaritime history is the broad overarching subject that includes fishing whaling international maritime law naval history the history of ships ship design shipbuilding the history of navigation the history of the various maritime-related sciences oceanography cartography hydrography etc sea exploration maritime economics and trade shipping yachting seaside resorts the history of lighthouses and aids to navigation maritime themes in literature maritime themes in art the social history of sailors and passengers and sea-related communities  there are a number of approaches to the field sometimes divided into two broad categories traditionalists who seek to engage a small audience of other academics and utilitarians who seek to influence policy makers and a wider audience


 historiography 
historians from many lands have published monographs popular and scholarly articles and collections of archival resources a leading journal is international journal of maritime history a fully refereed scholarly journal published twice a year by the international maritime economic history association based in canada with an international editorial board it explores the maritime dimensions of economic social cultural and environmental history for a broad overview see the four-volume encyclopedia edited by john b hattendorf oxford encyclopedia of maritime history oxford 2007 it contains over 900 articles by 400 scholars and runs 2900 pages  other major reference resources are spencer tucker ed naval warfare an international encyclopedia 3 vol abc-clio 2002 with 1500 articles in 1231 pages and i c b dear and peter kemp eds oxford companion to ships and the sea 2nd ed 2005 with 2600 articles in 688 pagestypically studies of merchant shipping and of defensive navies are seen as separate fields inland waterways are included within maritime history especially inland seas such as the great lakes of north america and major navigable rivers and canals worldwide
one approach to maritime history writing has been nicknamed rivet counting because of a focus on the minutiae of the vessel but revisionist scholars are creating new turns in the study of maritime history this includes a post-1980s turn towards the study of human users of ships which involves sociology cultural geography gender studies and narrative studies and post-2000 turn towards seeing sea travel as part of the wider history of transport and mobilities this move is sometimes associated with marcus rediker and black atlantic studies but most recently has emerged from the international association for the history of transport traffic and mobilities t2m

 ancient times 

throughout history sailing has been instrumental in the development of civilization affording humanity greater mobility than travel over land whether for trade transport or warfare and the capacity for fishing the earliest representation of a ship under sail appears on a painted disc found in kuwait dating to the late 5th millennium bc

in the time before ancient maritime history the first boats are presumed to have been dugout canoes developed independently by various stone age populations and used for coastal fishing and travel the indigenous of the pacific northwest are very skilled at crafting wood best known for totem poles up to 80 feet 24 m tall they also construct dugout canoes over 60 feet 18 m long for everyday use and ceremonial purposesthe earliest seaworthy boats may have been developed as early as 45,000 years ago according to one hypothesis  explaining the habitation of australiathe ancient egyptians had knowledge of sail construction this is governed by the science of aerodynamics according to the greek historian herodotus necho ii sent out an expedition of phoenicians which in three years sailed from the red sea around africa to the mouth of the nile some current historians believe herodotus on this point even though herodotus himself was in disbelief that the phoenicians had accomplished the act


 age of navigation 

chinas multi-mast sailing junks were carrying over 200 people as early as 200 ad and by the medieval period were particularly massive the southeast asian seafarers polynesians and northern european vikings concurrently developed oceangoing vessels and depended heavily upon them for travel and population movements prior to 1000 ad in early modern india and arabia the lateen-sail ship known as the dhow was used on the waters of the red sea indian ocean and persian gulf
chinas early trade exports included pepper safflower and fine spices there were two main trade routes during this time an islamic merchant network from arabia to ports of china and the tamil network from the chola kingdom to the coast of india water was the cheapest and usually the only way to transport goods in bulk over long distances in addition it was the safest way to transport commodities the long trade routes created popular trading ports called entrepôts there were three popular entrepôts the malaka in southwestern malaya hoi an in vietnam and ayuthaya in thailand these super centers for trade were ethnically diverse because ports served as a midpoint of voyages and trade instead of a destination the entrepôts helped link the coastal cities to the hempispheric trade nexus the increase in sea trade initiated a cultural exchange among traders from 1400 to 1600 the chinese population doubled from 75 million to 150 million as a result of imported goods this was known as the  age of commercemechanical engineer ma jun c 200-265 ad invented the south-pointing chariot a wheeled device employing a differential gear that allowed a fixed figurine to point always in the southern cardinal direction the mariners astrolabe was the chief tool of celestial navigation in early modern maritime history this scaled down version of the instrument used by astronomers served as a navigational aid to measure latitude at sea and was employed by portuguese sailors no later than 1481the precise date of the discovery of the magnetic needle compass is undetermined but the earliest attestation of the device for navigation was in the dream pool essays by shen kuo 1088 kuo was also the first to document the concept of true north to discern a compass magnetic declination from the physical north pole the earliest iterations of the compass consisted of a floating magnetized lodestone needle that spun around in a water filled bowl until it reached alignment with earths magnetic poles chinese sailors were using the wet compass to determine the southern cardinal direction no later than 1117 the first use of a magnetized needle for seafaring navigation in europe was written of by alexander neckham circa 1190 ad around 1300 ad the pivot-needle dry-box compass was invented in europe its cardinal direction pointed north similar to the modern-day mariners compass there was also the addition of the compass-card in europe which was later adopted by the chinese through contact with japanese pirates in the 16th century
the oldest known map is dated back to 12,000 bc and was found in a spanish cave and was discovered by pilar utrilla the early maps were oriented with east being at the top this is believed to have begun in the region of the middle east religion played a role in the drawing of maps countries that were predominantly christian during the middle ages placed east at the top of the maps in part due to genesisthe lord god planted a garden toward the east in eden this led to maps containing the image of jesus christ and the garden of eden at the top of maps the latitude and longitude coordinate tables were made with the sole purpose of praying towards mecca the next progression of maps came with the portolan chart the portolan was the first map that labeled north at the top and was drawn proportionate to size landmarks were drawn with great detail


 ships and vessels 

various ships were in use during the middle agesthe junk ship design popularized by the chinese was both innovative and adaptable junk vessels employed mat and batten style sails that could be raised and lowered in segments as well varying angles the longship was a type of ship that was developed over a period of centuries and perfected by its most famous user the vikings in approximately the 9th century the ships were clinker-built utilizing overlapping wooden strakes the knaar a relative of the longship was a type of cargo vessel it differed from the longship in that it was larger and relied solely on its square rigged sail for propulsion the cog was a design which is believed to have evolved from or at least been influenced by the longship and was in wide use by the 12th century it too used the clinker method of construction the caravel was a ship invented in islamic iberia and used in the mediterranean from the 13th century unlike the longship and cog it used a carvel method of construction it could be either square rigged caravela redonda or lateen rigged caravela latina the carrack was another type of ship invented in the mediterranean in the 15th century it was a larger vessel than the caravel columbuss ship the santa maría was a famous example of a carrack


 arab age of discovery 

the arab empire maintained and expanded a wide trade network across parts of asia africa and europe this helped establish the arab empire including the rashidun umayyad abbasid and fatimid caliphates as the worlds leading extensive economic power throughout the 7th-13th centuries the belitung is the oldest discovered arabic ship to reach the asian sea dating back over 1000 yearsapart from the nile tigris and euphrates navigable rivers in the islamic regions were uncommon so transport by sea was very important islamic geography and navigational sciences were highly developed  making use of a magnetic compass and a rudimentary instrument known as a kamal used for celestial navigation and for measuring the altitudes and latitudes of the stars when combined with detailed maps of the period sailors were able to sail across oceans rather than skirt along the coast according to the political scientist hobson  the origins of the caravel ship used for long-distance travel by the spanish and portuguese since the 15th century date back to the qarib used by andalusian explorers by the 13th centurycontrol of sea routes dictated the political and military power of the islamic nation the islamic border spread from spain to china maritime trade was used to link the vast territories that spanned the mediterranean sea to the indian ocean the arabs were among the first to sail the indian ocean long distance trade allowed the movement of armies craftsmen scholars and pilgrims sea trade was an important factor not just for the coastal ports and cities like istanbul but also for baghdad and iraq which are further inland sea trade enabled the distribution of food and supplies to feed entire populations in the middle east long distance sea trade imported raw materials for building luxury goods for the wealthy and new inventions


 hanseatic league 

the hanseatic league was an alliance of trading guilds that established and maintained a trade monopoly over the baltic sea to a certain extent the north sea and most of northern europe for a time in the late middle ages and the early modern period between the 13th and 17th centuries historians generally trace the origins of the league to the foundation of the northern german town of lübeck established in 1158/1159 after the capture of the area from the count of schauenburg and holstein by henry the lion the duke of saxony exploratory trading adventures raids and piracy had occurred earlier throughout the baltic see vikings — the sailors of gotland sailed up rivers as far away as novgorod for example — but the scale of international economy in the baltic area remained insignificant before the growth of the hanseatic league german cities achieved domination of trade in the baltic with striking speed over the next century and lübeck became a central node in all the seaborne trade that linked the areas around the north sea and the baltic sea
the 15th century saw the climax of lübecks hegemony visby one of the midwives of the hanseatic league in 1358 declined to become a member visby dominated trade in the baltic before the hanseatic league and with its monopolistic ideology suppressed the gotlandic free-trade competition by the late 16th century the league imploded and could no longer deal with its own internal struggles the social and political changes that accompanied the reformation the rise of dutch and english merchants and the incursion of the ottoman turks upon its trade routes and upon the holy roman empire itself only nine members attended the last formal meeting in 1669 and only three lübeck hamburg and bremen remained as members until its final demise in 1862


 somali maritime enterprise 

during the age of the ajuran the somali sultanates and republics of merca mogadishu barawa hobyo and their respective ports flourished they had a lucrative foreign commerce with ships sailing to and coming from arabia india venetia persia  egypt portugal and as far away as china in the 16th century duarte barbosa noted that many ships from the kingdom of cambaya in what is modern-day india sailed to mogadishu with cloths and spices for which they in return received gold wax and ivory barbosa also highlighted the abundance of meat wheat barley horses and fruit on the coastal markets which generated enormous wealth for the merchantsin the early modern period successor states of the adal and ajuran empires began to flourish in somalia who continued the seaborne trade established by previous somali empires the rise of the 19th century gobroon dynasty in particular saw a rebirth in somali maritime enterprise during this period the somali agricultural output to arabian markets was so great that the coast of somalia came to be known as the grain coast of yemen and oman


 age of discovery 

the age of discovery was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century during which european ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning capitalism in europe historians often refer to the age of discovery as the pioneer portuguese and later spanish long-distance maritime travels in search of alternative trade routes to the east indies moved by the trade of gold silver and spices in the process europeans encountered peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them
christopher columbus was a navigator and maritime explorer who is one of several historical figures credited as the discoverer of the americas it is generally believed that he was born in genoa although other theories and possibilities exist columbus voyages across the atlantic ocean began a european effort at exploration and colonization of the western hemisphere while history places great significance on his first voyage of 1492 he did not actually reach the mainland until his third voyage in 1498 likewise he was not the earliest european explorer to reach the americas as there are accounts of european transatlantic contact prior to 1492 nevertheless columbuss voyage came at a critical time of growing national imperialism and economic competition between developing nation states seeking wealth from the establishment of trade routes and colonies therefore the period before 1492 is known as pre-columbian
john cabot was a genoese navigator and explorer commonly credited as one of the first early modern europeans to land on the north american mainland aboard the matthew in 1497 sebastian cabot was an italian explorer and may have sailed with his father john cabot in may 1497 john cabot and perhaps sebastian sailing from bristol took their small fleet along the coasts of a new found land there is much controversy over where exactly cabot landed but two likely locations that are often suggested are nova scotia and newfoundland cabot and his crew including perhaps sebastian mistook this place for china without finding the passage to the east they were looking for some scholars maintain that the name america comes from richard amerik a bristol merchant and customs officer who is claimed on very slender evidence to have helped finance the cabot voyages
jacques cartier was a french navigator who first explored and described the gulf of st-lawrence and the shores of the saint lawrence river which he named canada juan fernández was a spanish explorer and navigator probably between 1563 and 1574 he discovered the juan fernández islands west of valparaíso chile he also discovered the pacific islands of san félix and san ambrosio 1574 among the other famous explorers of the period were vasco da gama pedro álvares cabral yermak juan ponce de león francisco coronado juan sebastián elcano bartolomeu dias ferdinand magellan willem barentsz abel tasman jean alfonse samuel de champlain willem jansz captain james cook henry hudson and giovanni da verrazzano

peter martyr danghiera was an italian-born historian of spain and of the discoveries of her representatives during the age of exploration he wrote the first accounts of explorations in central and south america in a series of letters and reports grouped in the original latin publications of 1511–1530 into sets of ten chapters called decades  his decades are thus of great value in the history of geography and discovery his de orbe novo published 1530 on the new world describes the first contacts of europeans and native americans and contains for example the first european reference to india rubber
richard hakluyt was an english writer and is principally remembered for his efforts in promoting and supporting the settlement of north america by the english through his works notably divers voyages touching the discoverie of america 1582 and the principal navigations voiages traffiques and discoueries of the english nation 1598–1600


 european expansion 

although europe is the worlds second-smallest continent in terms of area it has a very long coastline and has arguably been influenced more by its maritime history than any other continent europe is uniquely situated between several navigable seas and intersected by navigable rivers running into them in a way which greatly facilitated the influence of maritime traffic and commerce
when the carrack and then the caravel were developed by the portuguese european thoughts returned to the fabled east these explorations have a number of causes monetarists believe the main reason the age of exploration began was because of a severe shortage of bullion in europe the european economy was dependent on gold and silver currency but low domestic supplies had plunged much of europe into a recession another factor was the centuries long conflict between the iberians and the muslims to the south the eastern trade routes were controlled by the ottoman empire after the turks took control of constantinople in 1453 and they barred europeans from those trade routes  the ability to outflank the muslim states of north africa was seen as crucial to their survival at the same time the iberians learnt much from their arab neighbours the carrack and caravel both incorporated the mediterranean lateen sail that made ships far more manoeuvrable it was also through the arabs that ancient greek geography was rediscovered for the first time giving european sailors some idea of the shape of africa and asia


 european colonization 

in 1492 christopher columbus reached the americas after which european exploration and colonization rapidly expanding the post-1492 era is known as the columbian exchange period the first conquests were made by the spanish who quickly conquered most of south and central america and large parts of north america the portuguese took brazil the british french and dutch conquered islands in the caribbean sea many of which had already been conquered by the spanish or depopulated by disease early european colonies in north america included spanish florida the british settlements in virginia and new england french settlements in quebec and louisiana and dutch settlements in new netherlands denmark-norway revived its former colonies in greenland from the 18th until the 20th century and also colonised a few of the virgin islands

from its very outset western colonialism was operated as a joint public-private venture columbus voyages to the americas were partially funded by italian investors but whereas the spanish state maintained a tight rein on trade with its colonies by law the colonies could only trade with one designated port in the mother country and treasure was brought back in special convoys the english french and dutch granted what were effectively trade monopolies to joint-stock companies such as the east india companies and the hudsons bay company
in the exploration of africa there was the proliferation of conflicting european claims to african territory by the 15th century europeans explored the african coast in search of a water route to india these expeditions were mostly conducted by the portuguese who had been given papal authority to exploit all non-christian lands of the eastern hemisphere the europeans set up coastal colonies to prosecute  the slave trade but the interior of the continent remained unexplored until the 19th century this was a cumulative period that resulted in european colonial rule in africa and altered the future of the african continentimperialism in asia traces its roots back to the late 15th century with a series of voyages that sought a sea passage to india in the hope of establishing direct trade between europe and asia in spices before 1500 european economies were largely self-sufficient only supplemented by minor trade with asia and africa within the next century however european and asian economies were slowly becoming integrated through the rise of new global trade routes and the early thrust of european political power commerce and culture in asia gave rise to a growing trade in lucrative commodities—a key development in the rise of todays modern world capitalist economy european colonies in india were set up by several european nations beginning at the beginning of the 16th century rivalry between reigning european powers saw the entry of the dutch british and french among others


 ming maritime world 


 zheng he voyages 

in the 15th century before the european age of discovery began the chinese ming dynasty carried out a maritime operation that like the europeans late expeditions was primarily carried out to expand power increase trade and in some instances forcibly subdue local populationsin 1405 zheng he a muslim eunuch was ordered by the ming dynasty to lead a fleet of over 27,000 sailors and anywhere between 62 to 300 ships this was the beginning of an age of expedition which would last 33 years during his seven voyages zheng he visited over 30 countries spread out across the indian ocean under emperor yongle this naval undertaking served primarily as a deliverer of letters demanding tribute and allegiance to the middle kingdom gifts were the first approach to gaining a countrys favor but if circumstances required it zheng hes fleet would resort to violence the end result was a successful connection to 48 new tribute states and an influx of over 180 new trade goods many were gifts these expeditions expanded chinas diplomatic supremacy of the region and strengthened their economic ties in the area when these expeditions ended chinas maritime strength diminished and lacked a powerful navy for centuries after


 other ming maritime activity 
the end of the imperially-sponsored voyages however in no way meant that ming people no longer put to sea  merchants pirates fishermen and others depended on boats and ships for their livelihood and immigration to southeast asia both permanent and temporary continued throughout ming times  because chinese and chinese immigrants to southeast asia were the main players in commerce in the south china sea chinese merchants and ships were critical to the spanish trade in manila  not only did chinese merchants supply the goods the spanish bought with their american silver but chinese shipbuilders built the famous galleons that carried those goods and that silver back and forth across the pacific twice a year 


 clipper route 

during this time the clipper route was established by clipper ships between europe and the far east australia and new zealand the route ran from west to east through the southern ocean in order to make use of the strong westerly winds of the roaring forties many ships and sailors were lost in the heavy conditions along the route particularly at cape horn which the clippers had to round on their return to europe in september 1578 sir francis drake in the course of his circumnavigation of the world discovered cape horn this discovery went unused for some time as ships continued to use the known passage through the strait of magellan by the early 17th century the dutch merchant jacob le maire together with navigator willem schouten set off to investigate drakes suggestion of a route to the south of tierra del fuego at the time it was discovered the horn was believed to be the southernmost point of tierra del fuego the unpredictable violence of weather and sea conditions in the drake passage made exploration difficult and it was only in 1624 that the horn was discovered to be an island it is an interesting testament to the difficulty of conditions there that antarctica only 650 kilometres 400 mi away across the drake passage was discovered as recently as 1820 despite the passage having been used as a major shipping route for 200 years the clipper route fell into commercial disuse with the introduction of steam ships and the opening of the suez and panama canals


 end of exploration 
the age of exploration is generally said to have ended in the early 17th century by this time european vessels were well enough built and their navigators competent enough to travel to virtually anywhere on the planet exploration of course continued the arctic and antarctic seas were not explored until the 19th century


 age of sail 

the age of sail originates from ancient seafaring exploration during the rise of ancient civilizations  including mesopotamia the far east and the cradle of civilization the arabian sea has been an important marine trade route since the era of the coastal sailing vessels from possibly as early as the 3rd millennium bc certainly the late 2nd millennium bc up to and including the later days of age of sail by the time of julius caesar several well-established combined land-sea trade routes depended upon water transport through the sea around the rough inland terrain features to its north these routes usually began in the far east with transshipment via historic bharuch bharakuccha traversed past the inhospitable coast of todays iran then split around hadhramaut into two streams north into the gulf of aden and thence into the levant or south into alexandria via red sea ports such as axum each major route involved transhipping to pack animal caravans travel through desert country and risk of bandits and extortionate tolls by local potentiates southern coastal route past the rough country in the southern arabian peninsula yemen and oman today was significant and the egyptian pharaohs built several shallow canals to service the trade one more or less along the route of todays suez canal and another from the red sea to the nile river both shallow works that were swallowed up by huge sand storms in antiquityin the modern western countries the european age of sail is the period in which international trade and naval warfare were both dominated by sailing ships the age of sail mostly coincided with the age of discovery from the 15th to the 18th century after the 17th century english naval maps stopped using the term of british sea for the english channel from 15th to the 18th centuries the period saw square rigged sailing ships carry european settlers to many parts of the world in one of the most important human migrations in recorded history this period was marked by extensive exploration and colonization efforts on the part of european kingdoms the sextant developed in the 18th century made more accurate charting of nautical position possible

 spanish and english armadas 

the spanish armada was the spanish fleet that sailed against england under the command of the duke of medina sidona in 1588 the spanish armada was sent by king philip ii of spain who had been king consort of england until the death of his wife mary i of england thirty years earlier the purpose of the expedition was to escort the duke of parmas army of tercios from the spanish netherlands across the north sea for a landing in south-east england once the army had suppressed english support for the united provinces — part of the spanish netherlands — it was intended to cut off attacks against spanish possessions in the new world and the atlantic treasure fleets it was also hoped to reverse the protestant revolution in england and to this end the expedition was supported by pope sixtus v with the promise of a subsidy should it make land the command of the fleet was originally entrusted to alvaro de bazan a highly experienced naval commander who died a few months before the fleet sailed from lisbon in may 1588
the spanish armada consisted of about 130 warships and converted merchant ships after forcing its way up the english channel it was attacked by a fleet of 200 english ships assisted by the dutch navy in the north sea at gravelines off the coastal border between france and the spanish netherlands a fire-ship attack drove the armada ships from their safe anchorage and in the ensuing battle the spanish abandoned their rendezvous with parmas army
the spanish armada was blown north up the east coast of england and in a hasty strategic move attempted a return to spain by sailing around scotland and out into the atlantic past ireland but very severe weather destroyed a portion of the fleet and more than 24 vessels were wrecked on the north and western coasts of ireland with the survivors having to seek refuge in scotland of the spanish armadas initial complement of vessels about 50 did not return to spain however the loss to philips royal navy was comparatively small only seven ships failed to return and of these only three were lost to enemy action

 triangular trade 
in the 17th 18th and 19th centuries a network of maritime trade formed in the atlantic connecting europe africa and the americas through a triangular trade of african slaves sugarmolasses and rum this maritime trade route would enrich the english and americas while also pulling both deeper into the slave tradeeuropeans would buy slaves from the africans send these slaves to their sugar plantations in the caribbeans the sugarmolasses they produced would be shipped to the british american colonies and distilled into rum where it would be consumed in the colonies and sent to europe in some models of triangular trade the colonies take europes place and the model of trade shifts to slaves from africa to the caribbean sugar and molasses go to new england and the rumother finished goods would be sold in africa to get more slaves both of these models are not restricted to sugar trade tobacco cotton and other plantation based raw materials take the place of sugar and its derivatives


 piracy in the atlantic ocean 
during the age of discovery key trade routes to the new world formed in the caribbean and the atlantic ocean with this concentrated area of trade piracy was a significant maritime hazard in the 16th 17th and 18th centuries some nations would use pirates to sabotage their rivals going as far as supplying and recognizing them as legitimate eventually powers like the english and dutch implemented strong anti-piracy tactics to strengthen their trade empires in the 18th centuryin the 16th and 17th century caribbean the trading of slaves precious metals and raw materials all fell prey to piracy pirates would raid forts and attack ships at sea to get possession of merchants material wealth in some cases pirates would tie themselves to a maritime power like the british and aid them by raiding rival nations like the spanish and leaving british trade unmolested in areas like jamaica some pirates were friendly with the british and would remain on the fringes of the colony some of these pirates were accepted by british colonial governorsthe english and dutch had created extensive trade empires during the 17th and 18th century and saw pirates as a barrier to their continued growth english began building a codification for piracy which started a war against pirates that lasted from the 1670s ending in the 1720s during this time the english would develop a ship called the jamaica sloops which were better at fending off piracy in the late 1600s the british began building up their navy and were able to put an end to most piracy by the 1720s violently only isolated individual instances persisted


 life at sea 
shipping whether of cargo or passengers is a business and the duties of a ships captain reflect that a captains first duty was to the ships owner and often the captain was encouraged to buy into the business with at least a one eighth share of the ship a captains second duty was to the cargo itself followed thirdly by the crew
crew were broken into two shifts that served four hour alternating watches often with all hands jointly serving the noon to 400 watch american ships would commonly alternate watches with the addition of a two-hour dog watch work for sailors during their shift consisted primarily of general ship maintenance washing sanding painting and repairs from general wear and tear or damage from storms general ship operations like raising and lowering the anchor or furling and unfurling sails were done as needed during the off shift hours sailors could take care of their personal chores washing and repairing clothes sleeping and eating leisure time could was often spent reading writing in journals playing an instrument wood carving or fancy rope work the american seamans friend society in new york city would loan boxes of books to ships for sailors uselife aboard ship for immigrant travelers was much harsher and sometimes deadly ship owners would pack as many people as they could on board to maximize profits and little government oversight existed to ensure they received proper care during the voyage british immigrant ships would often show less care to the passengers than criminals on prison ships to australia in 1803 the passenger vessel act in britain limited occupancy to one person per two tons of the ships register america issue stricter laws in 1819 limiting ships to a 1 to 5 ratio with fine levied should an overcrowded ship arrive at port the act of feb 1847 further increased the amount of space granted to passengers with the confiscation of a ship as the penalty for overcrowding

 end of the sail 
like most periodic eras the definition is inexact and close enough to serve as a general description the age of sail runs roughly from the battle of lepanto in 1571 the last significant engagement in which oar-propelled galleys played a major role to the battle of hampton roads in 1862 in which the steam-powered css virginia destroyed the sailing ships uss cumberland and uss congress finally culminating with the advance of steam power rendering sail power obsolete


 submarines 
the history of submarines covers the historical chronology and facts related to submarines the ships and boats which operate underwater the modern underwater boat proposal was made by the englishman william bourne who designed a prototype submarine in 1578 unfortunately for him these ideas never got beyond the planning stage the first submersible proper to be actually built in modern times was built in 1620 by cornelius jacobszoon drebbel a dutchman in the service of james i it was based on bournes design it was propelled by means of oars the precise nature of the submarine type is a matter of some controversy some claim that it was merely a bell towed by a boat two improved types were tested in the thames between 1620 and 1624in 1900the us navy was sold their first submarine by an irish man named john holland from 1945 to 1955 tremendous changes were made for a great time when the first submarine was sent out to sail for the first time the united states heavily depended on the submarines as a weapon of war when they were going to war with the japanese


 age of steam 
steam was first applied to boats in the 1770s with the advent of economical steam engines efficient external combustion heat engines that makes use of the heat energy that exists in steam and converting it to mechanical work the prime mover was steam for ships the technology only became relevant to trans-oceanic travel after 1815 the year pierre andriel crossed the english channel aboard the steamship élise


 rise of the steam vessels 
a steamboat sometimes called a steamer became the primary method of propulsion is the age of steam power typically driving a propeller or paddlewheel small and large steamboats and riverboats worked on lakes and rivers steamships gradually replaced sailing ships for commercial shipping through the 19th century from 1815 on steamships increased significantly in speed and size
ironclads are steam-propelled warships of the later 19th century protected by iron or steel armor plates the ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells the first ironclad battleship gloire was launched by the french navy in 1859 she prompted the british royal navy to start building ironclads after the first clashes of ironclads took place during the american civil war it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored line-of-battle ship as the most powerful warship afloat

 maritime events of world war i 

at the start of the war the german empire had cruisers scattered across the globe some of them were subsequently used to attack allied merchant shipping the british royal navy systematically hunted them down though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect allied shipping for example the detached light cruiser sms emden part of the east-asia squadron stationed at tsingtao seized or destroyed 15 merchantmen as well as sinking a russian cruiser and a french destroyer however the bulk of the german east-asia squadron – consisting of the armoured cruisers sms scharnhorst and sms gneisenau light cruisers sms nürnberg and sms leipzig and two transport ships – did not have orders to raid shipping and was instead underway to germany when it was lost at the battle of the falkland islands in december 1914soon after the outbreak of hostilities britain initiated a naval blockade of germany preventing supplies from reaching its ports the strategy proved effective cutting off vital military and civilian supplies although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by international agreements a blockade of stationed ships within a three-mile 5 km radius was considered legitimate however britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean causing danger to even neutral ships though there was limited response to this tactic some expected a better response for germans aim with its unrestricted submarine warfaregerman u-boats attempted to cut the supply lines between north america and britain the nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival  after the infamous sinking of the passenger ship rms lusitania in 1915 germany promised not to target passenger liners in 1916 the united states launched a protest over a cross-channel passenger ferry sinking germany modified its rules of engagement finally in early 1917 germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare realizing the americans would eventually enter the war germany sought to strangle allied sea lanes before the us could transport a large army overseas
the u-boat threat lessened in 1917 when merchant ships entered convoys escorted by destroyers this tactic made it difficult for u-boats to find targets the accompanying destroyers might sink a submerged submarine with depth charges the losses to submarine attacks were reduced significantly but the convoy system slowed the flow of supplies the solution to the delays was a massive program to build new freighters various troop ships were too fast for the submarines and did not have to travel the north atlantic in convoysthe first world war also saw the first use of aircraft carriers in combat with hms furious launching sopwith camels in a successful raid against the zeppelin hangars at tondern in july 1918


 maritime events of world war ii 


 battle of the atlantic 

in the north atlantic german u-boats attempted to cut supply lines to the united kingdom by sinking merchant ships in the first four months of the war they sank more than 110 vessels in addition to supply ships the u-boats occasionally attacked british and canadian warships one u-boat sank the british carrier hms courageous while another managed to sink the battleship hms royal oak in her home anchorage of scapa flow
in the summer of 1941 the soviet union entered the war on the side of the allies although the soviets had tremendous reserves in manpower they had lost much of their equipment and manufacturing base in the first few weeks following the german invasion the western allies attempted to remedy this by sending arctic convoys which travelled from the united kingdom and the united states to the northern ports of the soviet union - archangel and murmansk the treacherous route around the north cape of norway was the site of many battles as the germans continually tried to disrupt the convoys using u-boats bombers and surface ships
following the entry of the united states into the war in december 1941 u-boats sank shipping along the east coast of the united states and canada the waters around newfoundland the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico they were initially so successful that this became known among u-boat crews as the second happy time eventually the institution of shore blackouts and an interlocking convoy system resulted in a drop in attacks and u-boats shifted their operations back to the mid-atlantic
the turning point of the battle of the atlantic took place in early 1943 as the allies refined their naval tactics effectively making use of new technology to counter the u-boats the allies produced ships faster than they were sunk and lost fewer ships by adopting the convoy system improved anti-submarine warfare meant that the life expectancy of a typical u-boat crew would be measured in months the vastly improved type 21 u-boat appeared as the war was ending but too late to affect the outcome in december 1943 the last major sea battle between the royal navy and nazi germanys kriegsmarine took place at the battle of north cape the german battleship scharnhorst was sunk by hms duke of york hms belfast and several destroyers


 pacific war 

the pacific war was the part of world war ii especially following the successful japanese attack on united states forces at pearl harbor to 1945 the main american naval theaters were as pacific ocean areas and southwest pacific area the british fought chiefly in the indian ocean it was a war of logistics with american home bases in california and hawaii sending supplies to australia the us used its submarines to sink japanese transports and oil tankers thereby cutting off japans supplies to its outposts and causing a severe shortage of gasoline

island hopping was the key strategy to bypass heavily fortified japanese positions and instead concentrate the limited allied resources on strategically important islands that were not well defended but capable of supporting the drive to the main islands of japan this strategy was possible in part because the allies used submarine and air attacks to blockade and isolate japanese bases weakening their garrisons and reducing the japanese ability to resupply and reinforce most japanese soldiers killed in the pacific died of starvation and japan used its submarine fleet to try to resupply them
hard-fought battles on the japanese home islands of iwo jima okinawa and others resulted in horrific casualties on both sides but finally produced a japanese retreat faced with the loss of most of their experienced pilots the japanese increased their use of kamikaze tactics in an attempt to create unacceptably high casualties for the allies after the turning point of the pacific where a third of the imperial japanese navy fleet was hit in the battle of midway the united states department of the navy recommended various positions for and against an invasion of japan in 1945 some staff proposed to force a japanese surrender through a total naval blockade or air raids


 latter half of the 20th century 
in the latter half of the 20th century various vessels notably aircraft carriers nuclear submarines and nuclear-powered icebreakers made use of nuclear marine propulsion sonar and radio augmented existing navigational technology
various blockades were set up in international action the egyptian set up blockades of the straits of tiran prior to the 1956 suez war and the 1967 six-day war the united states set up a blockade of cuba during the cuban missile crisis in 1962 the israelis set up a sea blockade of the gaza strip since the outbreak of the second intifada 2000 and up to the present the israeli blockades of some or all the shores of lebanon at various times during the lebanese civil war 1975–1990 the 1982 lebanon war and the south lebanon conflict 1985–2000—resumed during the 2006 lebanon war


 cuban missile crisis 

the cuban missile crisis was seen as an event that brought the us closest to nuclear war and nearly the end of human existence the event was on october the 22 1962 during the presidency of john f kennedy it also happened over a 13-day period the nuclear power of the united states had a hand in why this event occurred from this situation the country learned that nuclear power  does  not have a lot of influence in politics the soviet leader klrushchv was the first to have his missiles fall back at the time it did not look like the united states was going to do the same the us did not back down because an american plane had been shot down in cuba during the event the blockade ended when the two powers resolved the issue peacefully


 gulf of tonkin incident 

the gulf of tonkin incident was an alleged pair of attacks by the democratic republic of vietnam against two american warships in 1964one night a us ship was sailing in north vietnam when they thought they were being attacked the president at this time decided that he needed to make a statement and asked congress for permission to act on this congress gave him permission by approving the gulf of tonkin resolution on august 7 1964 with this resolution president johnson was able to release missiles on north vietnamese torpedo boats and oil storage facilities the resolution was repealed in january 1971


 falklands war

 panama canal handover 

though controversial within the united states a process of handing the panama canal lead to panamanian control of the panama canal zone by the panama canal authority acp it was effective at noon on december 31 1999 before this handover the government of panama held an international bid to negotiate a 25-year contract for operation of the canals container shipping ports chiefly two facilities at the atlantic and pacific outlets which was won by the chinese firm hutchison whampoa a hong kong-based shipping concern whose owner li ka shing is the wealthiest man in asia one of the conditions on the handover to the panama canal authority by the united states was the permanent neutrality of the canal and the explicit statements that allowed the united states to come back at any time


 21st century 

since the turn of the millennium the construction of stealth ships have occurred these are ships which employs stealth technology construction techniques in an effort to ensure that it is harder to detect by one or more of radar visual sonar and infrared methods these techniques borrow from stealth aircraft technology although some aspects such as wake reduction are unique to stealth ships design
some of the major social changes of this period include women becoming admirals in defensive navies being allowed to work on submarines and being appointed captains of cruise ships


 piracy 

seaborne piracy against transport vessels remains a significant issue with estimated worldwide losses of us13 to 16 billion per year particularly in the waters between the red sea and indian ocean off the somali coast and also in the strait of malacca and singapore which are used by over 50,000 commercial ships a year
modern pirates favor small boats and taking advantage of the small number of crew members on modern cargo vessels they also use large vessels to supply the smaller attackboarding vessels modern pirates can be successful because a large amount of international commerce occurs via shipping major shipping routes take cargo ships through narrow bodies of water such as the gulf of aden and the strait of malacca making them vulnerable to be overtaken and boarded by small motorboats other active areas include the south china sea and the niger delta as usage increases many of these ships have to lower cruising speeds to allow for navigation and traffic control making them prime targets for piracy
the international maritime bureau imb maintains statistics regarding pirate attacks dating back to 1995 their records indicate hostage-taking overwhelmingly dominates the types of violence against seafarers for example in 2006 there were 239 attacks 77 crew members were kidnapped and 188 taken hostage but only 15 of the pirate attacks resulted in murder in 2007 the attacks rose by 10% to 263 attacks there was a 35% increase on reported attacks involving guns crew members that were injured numbered 64 compared to just 17 in 2006 that number does not include hostageskidnapping where they were not injured

modern definitions of piracy include the following acts

boarding
extortion
hostage taking
kidnapping of people for ransom
murder
robbery
sabotage resulting in the ship subsequently sinking
seizure of items or the ship
shipwrecking done intentionally to a ship
