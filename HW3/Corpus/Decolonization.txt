decolonization american english or decolonisation british english is the undoing of colonialism the latter being the process whereby a nation establishes and maintains its domination over one or more other territories the concept particularly applies to the dismantlement during the second half of the 20th century of the colonial empires established prior to world war i throughout the worldthe united nations special committee on decolonization has stated that in the process of decolonization there is no alternative to the colonizer but to allow a process of self-determination but in practice decolonization may involve either nonviolent revolution or national liberation wars by pro-independence groups it may be intramural or involve the intervention of foreign powers acting individually or through international bodies such as the united nations although examples of decolonization can be found as early as the writings of thucydides there have been several particularly active periods of decolonization in modern times  these include the breakup of the spanish empire in the 19th century of the german austro-hungarian ottoman and russian empires following world war i of the british french  dutch japanese portuguese belgian and italian colonial empires following world war ii and of the soviet union successor to the russian empire in 1991decolonization has been used to refer to the intellectual decolonisation from the colonizers ideas that made the colonized feel inferior


 methods and stages 
decolonization is a political process in extreme circumstances there is a war of independence more often there is a dynamic cycle where negotiations fail minor disturbances ensue resulting in suppression by the police and military forces escalating into more violent revolts that lead to further negotiations until independence is granted in rare cases the actions of the pro-independence movements are characterized by nonviolence with the indian independence movement led by mohandas karamchand gandhi being one of the most notable examples and the violence comes as active suppression from the occupying forces or as political opposition from forces representing minority local communities who feel threatened by the prospect of independence for example there was a war of independence in french indochina while in some countries in french west africa excluding the maghreb countries decolonization resulted from a combination of insurrection and negotiation the process is only complete when the de facto government of the newly independent country is recognized as the de jure sovereign state by the community of nationsindependence is often difficult to achieve without the encouragement and practical support from one or more external parties the motives for giving such aid are varied nations of the same ethnic andor religious stock may sympathize with the people of the country or a strong nation may attempt to destabilize a colony as a tactical move to weaken a rival or enemy colonizing power or to create space for its own sphere of influence examples of this include british support of the haitian revolution against france and the monroe doctrine of 1823 in which the united states warned the european powers not to interfere in the affairs of the newly independent states of the western hemisphere
as world opinion became more pro-independence following world war i there was an institutionalized collective effort to advance the cause of decolonization through the league of nations under article 22 of the covenant of the league of nations a number of mandates were created the expressed intention was to prepare these countries for self-government but the mandates are often interpreted as a mere redistribution of control over the former colonies of the defeated powers mainly the german empire and the ottoman empire this reassignment work continued through the united nations with a similar system of trust territories created to adjust control over both former colonies and mandated territories

in referendums some colonial populations have chosen to retain their colonial status such as gibraltar and french guiana  there are even examples such as the falklands war in which an imperial power goes to war to defend the right of a colony to continue to be a colony  colonial powers have sometimes promoted decolonization in order to shed the financial military and other burdens that tend to grow in those colonies where the colonial governments have become more benign
decolonization is rarely achieved through a single historical act but rather progresses through one or more stages of decolonization each of which can be offered or fought for these can include the introduction of elected representatives advisory or voting minority or majority or even exclusive degrees of autonomy or self-rule thus the final phase of decolonization may in fact concern little more than handing over responsibility for foreign relations and security and soliciting de jure recognition for the new sovereignty but even following the recognition of statehood a degree of continuity can be maintained through bilateral treaties between now equal governments involving practicalities such as military training mutual protection pacts or even a garrison andor military bases


 history 
beginning with the emergence of the united states in the 1770s decolonization took place in the context of atlantic history against the background of the american and french revolutions decolonization became a popular movement in many colonies in the 20th century and a reality after 1945the historian william hardy mcneill in his famous 1963 book the rise of the west appears to have interpreted the post-1945 decline of european empires as paradoxically being due to westernization itself writing that

although european empires have decayed since 1945 and the separate nation-states of europe have been eclipsed as centers of political power by the melding of peoples and nations occurring under the aegis of both the american and russian governments it remains true that since the end of world war ii the scramble to imitate and appropriate science technology and other aspects of western culture has accelerated enormously all round the world thus the dethronement of western europe from its brief mastery of the globe conincided with and was caused by an unprecedended rapid westernization of all the peoples of the earth
in the same book mcneill wrote that the rise of the west as intended by the title and meaning of this book is only accelerated when one or another asian or african people throws off european administration by making western techniques attitudes and ideas sufficiently their own to permit them to do so


 american revolution 

great britains thirteen north american colonies were the first to break from the british empire in 1776 and were recognized as an independent nation by france in 1778 and britain in 1783  the united states of america  was the first set of european established colonies to achieve independence and establish itself as a nation and was the first independent settler state in the americas


 haitian revolution 

the haitian revolution was a slave uprising that began in 1791 in the french colony of saint-domingue on the caribbean island of hispaniola in 1804 haiti secured independence from france as the empire of haiti which later became a republic


 spanish america 

the chaos of the napoleonic wars in europe cut the direct links between spain and its american colonies allowing for process of decolonization to beginwith the invasion of spain by napoleon in 1806 the american colonies declared autonomy and loyalty to king ferdinand vii the contract was broken and the regions of the spanish empire had to decide whether to show allegiance to the junta of cadiz the only territory in spain free from napoleon or have a junta assembly of its own the economic monopoly of the metropolis was the main reason why many countries decided to become independent from spain in 1809 the independence wars of latin america begun with a revolt in la paz bolivia in 1807 and 1808 the viceroyalty of the river plate was invaded by the british after their 2nd defeat a frenchman called santiague de liniers was proclaimed new viceroy by the local population and later accepted by spain in may 1810 in buenos aires a junta was created but in montevideo it was not recognized by the local government who followed the authority of the junta of cadiz the rivalry between the 2 harbors was the main reason for the distrust between the 2 cities   during the next 15 years the spanish and royalist on one side and the rebels fought in south america and mexico numerous countries declared their independence in 1824 the spanish forces were defeated in the battle of ayacucho the mainland was free and in 1898 spain lost cuba and puerto rico in the spanish–american war puerto rico became a colony of the usa but cuba was independent in 1902


 ottoman empire 
cyprus

cyprus was invaded and taken over by the ottoman empire in 1570 it was later relinquished by the ottomans in 1878 the cypriots expressed their true disdain for ottoman rule through revolts and nationalist movements the ottomans only suppressed these revolts in the harshest of fashion but that only ended up fueling the revolts and desire for independence the cypriots desired to merge with greece because they felt a close connection with greece they were tired of 3 centuries of turkic rule and openly expressed their desire for enosis the cypriots would embrace greek culture and traditions they abandoned ottoman architecture and showed little respect for ottoman rule all these acts of defiance could be attributed to decolonization when the cypriots made acts of nationalism they were participating in a form of decolonization because they were attempting to remove all trace of turkic and muslim influence within their society the greek war of independence had major affects on cyprus and after the ottomans had left cyprus continued to create a greek culture they wished to be a part of cyprus would continue to create this imagined identity of greek culture this can also be a form of imagined human geography because cyprus used this identity to justify its revolts and nationalist movements 
a number of people mainly christians in the balkans previously conquered by the ottoman empire were able to achieve independence in the 19th century a process that peaked at the time of the ottoman defeat in the russo-turkish war of 1877–78
the ottoman empire had failed to raise revenue and a monopoly of effective armed forces this may have caused the fall of the ottoman empire


 egypt 

in the wake of the 1798 french invasion of egypt and its subsequent expulsion in 1801 the commander of an albanian regiment muhammad ali was able to gain control of egypt  although he was acknowledged by the sultan in constantinople in 1805 as his pasha muhammad ali and eventually his successors were de facto monarchs of a largely independent state managing its own foreign relations however despite this de facto independence egypt did remain nominally a vassal state of the ottoman empire obliged to pay a hefty annual tribute to the sultan throughout the long 19th century muhammad ali would send scores of azhar scholars to france and other european countries to be educated in the empirical sciences due to the heavy inferiority complex ingrained from french defeat however such scholars would unwittingly participate in their countrys intellectual colonization throughout this century and establish the national public educational system on secular humanist enlightenment philosophy and principles and western culture in general to this day upon declaring war on turkey in november 1914 britain unilaterally declared the sultans rights and title over egypt abolished and proclaimed its own protectorate over the country


 greece 

the greek war of independence 1821–1829 was fought to liberate greece from a three centuries long ottoman occupation  independence was secured by the intervention of the british and french navies and the french and russian armies but greece was limited to an area including perhaps only one-third of ethnic greeks that later grew significantly with the megali idea project the war ended many of the privileges of the phanariot greeks of constantinople


 bulgaria 

following a failed bulgarian revolt in 1876 the subsequent russo-turkish war ended with the provisional treaty of san stefano established a huge new realm of bulgaria including most of macedonia and thrace the final 1878 treaty of berlin allowed the other great powers to limit the size of the new russian client state and even briefly divided this rump state in two bulgaria and eastern rumelia but the irredentist claims from the first treaty would direct bulgarian claims through the first and second balkan wars and both world wars


 romania 

romania fought on the russian side in the russo-turkish war and in the 1878 treaty of berlin romania was recognized as an independent state by the great powers


 serbia 

centuries  of armed and unarmed struggle ended with the recognition of serbian independence from the ottoman empire at the congress of berlin in 1878


 montenegro 
the independence of the principality of montenegro from the ottoman empire was recognized at the congress of berlin in 1878 however the montenegrin nation has been de facto independent since 1711 officially accepted by the tsardom of russia by the order of tsar petr i alexeyevich-romanov in the period 1795–1798 montenegro once again claimed independence after the battle of krusi in 1806 it was recognized as a power fighting against napoleon meaning that it had a fully mobilized and supplied army by russia through admiral dmitry senyavin at the bay of kotor 
in the period of reign of petar ii petrović-njegoš montenegro was again colonized by turkey but that changed with the coming of knyaz danilo i with a totally successful war against turkey in the late 1850s ending with a decisive victory of the montenegrin army under grand duke mirko petrović-njegoš brother of danilo i at the battle of grahovac the full independence was given to montenegro after almost 170 years of fighting the turks bosniaks albanians and the french 1806–1814 at the congress of berlin


 british empire 

the emergence of indigenous bourgeois elites was especially characteristic of the british empire which seemed less capable or less ruthless in controlling political nationalism driven by pragmatic demands of budgets and manpower the british made deals with the nationalist elites  across the empire the general protocol was to convene a constitutional conference in london to discuss the transition to greater self-government and then independence submit a report of the constitutional conference to parliament if approved submit a bill to parliament at westminster to terminate the responsibility of the united kingdom with a copy of the new constitution annexed and finally if approved issuance of an order of council fixing the exact date of independenceafter world war i several former german and ottoman territories in the middle east africa and the pacific were governed by the uk as league of nations mandates some were administered directly by the uk and others by british dominions – nauru and the territory of new guinea by australia south west africa by the union of south africa and western samoa by new zealand
egypt became independent in 1922 although the uk retained security prerogatives control of the suez canal and effective control of the anglo-egyptian sudan the balfour declaration of 1926 declared the british empire dominions as equals and the 1931 statute of westminster established full legislative independence for them the equal dominions were  six– canada newfoundland australia the irish free state new zealand and the union of south africa however some of the dominions were already independent de facto and even de jure and recognized as such by the international community thus canada was a founding member of the league of nations in 1919 and served on the council from 1927 to 1930 that country also negotiated on its own and signed bilateral and multilateral treaties and conventions from the early 1900s onward newfoundland ceded self-rule back to london in 1934 iraq a league of nations mandate became independent in 1932
in response to a growing indian independence movement the uk made successive reforms to the british raj culminating in the government of india act 1935 these reforms included creating elected legislative councils in some of the provinces of british india mohandas karamchand gandhi indias independence movement leader led a peaceful resistance to the british rule by becoming a symbol of both peace and opposition to british imperialism many indians began to view the british as the cause of indias problems leading to a newfound sense of nationalism among its population with this new wave of indian nationalism gandhi was eventually able to garner the support needed to push back the british and create an independent india in 1947africa was only fully drawn into the colonial system at the end of the 19th century in the north-east the continued independence of the empire of ethiopia remained a beacon of hope to pro-independence activists however with the anti-colonial wars of the 1900s decade barely over new modernising forms of african nationalism began to gain strength in the early 20th-century with the emergence of pan-africanism as advocated by the jamaican journalist marcus garvey 1887–1940 whose widely distributed newspapers demanded swift abolition of european imperialism as well as republicanism in egypt kwame nkrumah 1909–1972 who was inspired by the works of garvey led ghana to independence from colonial rule
independence for the colonies in africa began with the independence of sudan in 1956 and ghana in 1957 all of the british colonies on mainland africa became independent by 1966 although rhodesias unilateral declaration of independence in 1965 was not recognized by the uk or internationally
some of the british colonies in asia were directly administered by british officials while others were ruled by local monarchs as protectorates or in subsidiary alliance with the uk
in 1947 british india was partitioned into the independent dominions of india and pakistan hundreds of princely states states ruled by monarchs in treaty of subsidiary alliance with britain were integrated into india and pakistan india and pakistan fought several wars over the former princely state of jammu and kashmir french india was integrated into india between 1950 and 1954 and india annexed portuguese india in 1961 and the kingdom of sikkim in 1975


 violence civil warfare and partition 
significant violence was involved in several prominent cases of decolonization of the british empire partition was a frequent solution in 1783 the north american colonies were divided between the independent united states and british north america which later became canada
the indian rebellion of 1857 was a revolt of a portion of the indian army it was characterized by massacres of civilians on both sides it was not a movement for independence however and only a small part of india was involved in the aftermath the british pulled back from modernizing reforms of indian society and the level of organized violence under the british raj was relatively small most of that was initiated by repressive british administrators as in the amritsar massacre of 1919 or the police assaults on the  salt march of 1930 large-scale communicable violence broke out after the british left in 1947 turning india over to the new nations of india and pakistanthe independence movement in ireland and the 19th and early 20th century was marked by occasional outbursts of violence culminating in the small-scale easter rising of 1916 and the much larger irish war of independence of 1919 to 1921 it was resolved when london gave independence to the catholic regions of southern ireland and kept control of protestant northern irelandcyprus which came under full british control in 1914 from the ottoman empire was culturally divided between the majority  greek element which demanded demanded enosis or union with greece and the minority turks london for decades assumed it needed the island to defend the suez canal but after the suez crisis of 1956 that became a minor factor and greek violence became a more serious issue cyprus became an independent country in 1960 but ethnic violence escalated until 1974 when turkey invaded  and partitioned the island each side rewrote its own history blaming the otherpalestine became a british mandate from the league of nations and during the war the british gained support from both sides by making promises both to the arabs and the jews see balfour declaration decades of enthno—religious violence resulted the british pulled out and the mandate was effectively partitioned


 french empire 

after world war i the colonized people were frustrated at frances failure to recognize the effort provided by the french colonies resources but more importantly colonial troops – the famous tirailleurs although in paris the great mosque of paris was constructed as recognition of these efforts the french state had no intention to allow self-rule let alone grant independence to the colonized people thus nationalism in the colonies became stronger in between the two wars leading to abd el-krims rif war 1921–1925 in morocco and to the creation of messali hadjs star of north africa in algeria in 1925 however these movements would gain full potential only after world war ii
after world war i france administered the former ottoman territories of syria and lebanon and the former german colonies of togoland and cameroon as league of nations mandates lebanon declared its independence in 1943 and syria in 1945
although france was ultimately a victor of world war ii nazi germanys occupation of france and its north african colonies during the war had disrupted colonial rule on october 27 1946 france adopted a new constitution creating the fourth republic and substituted the french union for the colonial empire however power over the colonies remained concentrated in france and the power of local assemblies outside france was extremely limited on the night of march 29 1947 a nationalist uprising in madagascar led the french government headed by paul ramadier socialist to violent repression one year of bitter fighting 11,000–40,000 malagasy died
in 1946 the states of french indochina withdrew from the french union leading to the indochina war 1946–54 ho chi minh who had been a co-founder of the french communist party in 1920 and had founded the vietminh in 1941 declared independence from france and led the armed resistance against frances reoccupation of indochina cambodia and laos became independent in 1953 and the 1954 geneva accords ended frances occupation of indochina leaving north vietnam and south vietnam independent
in 1956 morocco and tunisia gained their independence from france in 1960 eight independent countries emerged from french west africa and five from french equatorial africa the algerian war of independence raged from 1954 to 1962 to this day the algerian war – officially called  a public order operation until the 1990s – remains a trauma for both france and algeria philosopher paul ricœur has spoken of the necessity of a decolonization of memory starting with the recognition of the 1961 paris massacre during the algerian war and the decisive role of african and especially north african immigrant manpower in the trente glorieuses post–world war ii economic growth period in the 1960s due to economic needs for post-war reconstruction and rapid economic growth french employers actively sought to recruit manpower from the colonies explaining todays multiethnic population


 after 1918 


 western european colonial powers 

the new imperialism period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries which included the scramble for africa and the opium wars marked the zenith of european colonization it also accelerated the trends that would end colonialism the extraordinary material demands of the conflict had spread economic change across the world notably inflation and the associated social pressures of war imperialism created both peasant unrest and a burgeoning middle class
economic growth created stakeholders with their own demands while racial issues meant these people clearly stood apart from the colonial middle-class and had to form their own group the start of mass nationalism as a concept and practice would fatally undermine the ideologies of imperialism
there were naturally other factors from agrarian change and disaster – french indochina changes or developments in religion buddhism in burma islam in the dutch east indies marginally people like john chilembwe in nyasaland and the impact of the 1930s great depression
the great depression despite the concentration of its impact on the industrialized world was also exceptionally damaging in the rural colonies agricultural prices fell much harder and faster than those of industrial goods from around 1925 until world war ii the colonies suffered the colonial powers concentrated on domestic issues protectionism and tariffs disregarding the damage done to international trade flows the colonies almost all primary cash crop producers lost the majority of their export income and were forced away from the open complementary colonial economies to closed systems while some areas returned to subsistence farming british malaya others diversified  india west africa and some began to industrialise these economies would not fit the colonial straitjacket when efforts were made to renew the links further the european-owned and -run plantations proved more vulnerable to extended deflation than native capitalists reducing the dominance of white farmers in colonial economies and making the european governments and investors of the 1930s co-opt indigenous elites – despite the implications for the future  colonial reform also hastened their end notably the move from non-interventionist collaborative systems towards directed disruptive direct management to drive economic change the creation of genuine bureaucratic government boosted the formation of indigenous bourgeoisie


 united states 

a former colony itself the united states approached imperialism differently from the other powers much of its energy and rapidly expanding population was directed westward across the north american continent against  english and french claims  the spanish empire  and mexico  the native americans were sent to reservations often unwillingly with support from britain its monroe doctrine reserved the americas as its sphere of interest prohibiting other states particularly spain from recolonizing the newly independent polities of latin america however france taking advantage of the american governments distraction during the civil war intervened militarily in mexico and set up a french-protected monarchy  spain took the step to occupy the dominican republic and restore colonial rule the union victory in the civil war in 1865 forced both france and spain to accede to american demands to evacuate those two countries  americas only african colony liberia was formed privately and achieved independence early washington unofficially protected it by 1900 the us advocated an open door policy and opposed the direct division of china

after 1898 direct intervention expanded in latin america  in 1867 the united states purchased russian america from the tsar and annexed hawaii in 1898 it added most of spains remaining colonies in 1898-99 deciding not to annex cuba outright the us established it as a client state with obligations including the perpetual lease of guantánamo bay to the us navy the attempt of the first governor to void the islands constitution and remain in power past the end of his term provoked a rebellion that provoked a reoccupation between 1906 and 1909 but this was again followed by devolution similarly the mckinley administration despite prosecuting the philippine–american war against a native republic set out that the territory of the philippine islands was eventually granted independence   in 1917 the us purchased the danish west indies later renamed the us virgin islands from denmark and puerto ricans became full us citizens that same year the us government declared puerto rico the territory was no longer a colony and stopped transmitting information about it to the united nations decolonization committee as a result the un general assembly removed puerto rico from the un list of non-self-governing territories  four referenda showed little support for independence but much interest in statehood such as hawaii and alaska received in 1959the monroe doctrine was expanded by the roosevelt corollary in 1904 providing that the united states had a right and obligation to intervene in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence that a nation in the western hemisphere became vulnerable to european control in practice this meant that the united states was led to act as a collections agent for european creditors by administering customs duties in the dominican republic 1905–1941 haiti 1915–1934 and elsewhere the intrusiveness and bad relations this engendered were somewhat checked by the clark memorandum and renounced by president franklin d roosevelts good neighbor policy
after 1947 the us poured tens of billions of dollars into the marshall plan and other grants and loans to europe and asia to rebuild the world economy washington pushed hard to accelerate decolonialization and bring an end to the colonial empires of its western allies most importantly during the 1956 suez crisis but american military bases were established around the world and direct and indirect interventions continued in korea indochina latin america inter alia the 1965 occupation of the dominican republic africa and the middle east to oppose communist invasions and insurgencies since the dissolution of the soviet union the united states has been far less active in the americas but invaded afghanistan and iraq following the september 11 attacks in 2001 establishing army and air bases in central asia


 japan 

before world war i japan had gained several substantial colonial possessions in east asia such as taiwan 1895 and korea 1910 japan joined the allies in world war i and after the war acquired the south pacific mandate the former german colony in micronesia as a league of nations mandate pursuing a colonial policy comparable to those of european powers japan settled significant populations of ethnic japanese in its colonies while simultaneously suppressing indigenous ethnic populations by enforcing the learning and use of the japanese language in schools other methods such as public interaction and attempts to eradicate the use of korean hokkien and hakka among the indigenous peoples were seen to be used japan also set up the imperial universities in korea keijō imperial university and taiwan taihoku imperial university to compel education
in 1931 japan seized manchuria from the republic of china setting up a puppet state under puyi the last manchu emperor of china in 1933 japan seized the chinese province of jehol and incorporated it into its manchurian possessions the second sino-japanese war started in 1937 and japan occupied much of eastern china including the republics capital at nanjing an estimated 20 million chinese died during the 1931–1945 war with japanin december 1941 the japanese empire joined world war ii by invading the european and us colonies in southeast asia and the pacific including french indochina hong kong the philippines burma malaya indonesia portuguese timor and others following its surrender to the allies in 1945 japan was deprived of all its colonies the soviet union declared war on japan in august 1945 and shortly after occupied and annexed the southern kuril islands which japan still claims


 central europe 
the russian german and austro-hungarian empires collapsed at the end of world war i and were replaced by republics finland estonia latvia lithuania poland and czechoslovakia became independent countries yugoslavia and romania expanded into former austro-hungarian territory the soviet union succeeded the russian empire in the remainder if its former territory and germany austria and hungary were reduced in size
in 1938 nazi germany annexed austria and part of czechoslovakia and in 1939 nazi germany and the ussr concluded a pact to occupy the countries that lie between them the ussr occupied finland estonia latvia and lithuania and germany and the ussr split poland in two the occupation of poland started world war ii germany attacked the ussr in 1941 the ussr allied with the uk and usa and emerged as one of the victors of the war occupying most of central and eastern europe


 after 1945 


 planning for decolonization 


 us and philippines 
in the united states the two major parties were divided on the acquisition of the philippines which became a major campaign issue in 1900 the republicans who favored permanent acquisition won the election but after a decade or so republicans turned their attention to the caribbean focusing on building the panama canal president woodrow wilson a democrat in office from 1913 to 1921 ignored the philippines and focused his attention on mexico and caribbean nations by the 1920s the peaceful efforts by the filipino leadership to pursue independence proved convincing when the democrats returned to power in 1933 they worked with filipino to plan a smooth transition to independence it was scheduled for 1946 by tydings–mcduffie act of 1934 in 1935 the philippines transitioned out of territorial status controlled by an appointed governor to the semi-independent status of the commonwealth of the philippines its constitutional convention wrote a new constitution which was approved by washington and went into effect with an elected governor manuel l quezon and legislature foreign affairs remained under american control the philippines built up a new army under general douglas macarthur who took leave from his us army position to take command of the new army reporting to quezon the japanese occupation 1942 to 1945 disrupted but did not delay the transition it took place on schedule in 1946 as manuel roxas took office as president


 portugal 
although a small poor country portugal had one of the oldest and largest of the empires the british had long protected it and by 1945 it regained possessions it had lost to the japanese portugal was an authoritarian state with no taste for democracy at home  or in its colonies  there was a fierce determination to maintain possession at all costs and aggressively defeat any insurgencies however portugal was helpless when india seized goa in 1961  in 1961 nationalist forces began organizing in portugal and the revolts spread to mozambique and guinea bissau lisbon escalated its repressive measures and setting up strategic hamlets deeply distrustful of the natives portugal sent another 300,000 european settlers into angola by 1974 in 1974 left-wing revolution inside portugal destroyed the old system and encouraged pro-soviet elements to attempt to seize control in the colonies the result was a very long and extremely difficult multi-party civil war in angola and lesser insurrections in mozambique


 belgium 
belgium is a small rich european country that had an empire forced upon it by international demand in 1908 in response to the malfeasance of its king leopold in greatly mistreating the congo it added rwanda and burundi as league of nations mandates from the former german empire in 1919  the colonies remained independent during the war while belgium itself was cruelly occupied by the germans there was no serious planning for independence and exceedingly little training or education provided  the belgian congo was especially rich and many belgian businessmen lobbied hard to maintain control local revolts grew in power  and finally the belgian king suddenly announced in 1959 that independence was on the agenda – and it was hurriedly arranged in 1960 for country bitterly and deeply divided on social and economic grounds


 the netherlands 
the netherlands a small rich country in western europe had spent centuries building up  its empire by 1940 it consisted mostly of the dutch east indies  now indonesia its massive oil reserves provided about 14 percent of the dutch national product and supported a large population of ethnic dutch government officials and businessmen in jakarta and other major cities the netherlands was overrun and almost starved to death by the nazis during the war and japan sank the dutch fleet in seizing the east indies in 1945 the  netherlands could not regain these islands on its own it did so by depending on british military help and american financial grants by the time dutch soldiers returned an independent government under sukarno originally set up by the japanese was in power the dutch in the east indies and at home were practically unanimous except for the communists that dutch power and prestige and wealth depended on an extremely expensive war to regain the islands   compromises were negotiated were trusted by neither side when the indonesian republic successfully suppressed a  large-scale communist revolt the united states realized that it needed the nationalist government as an ally  in the cold war  dutch possession was an obstacle to american cold war goals so washington forced the dutch to grant full independence a few years later sukarno seized all dutch properties and expelled all ethnic dutch—over 300,000—as well as several hundred thousand ethnic indonesians who supported the dutch cause in the aftermath the netherlands prospered greatly in the 1950s and 1960s but nevertheless public opinion was bitterly hostile to the united states for betrayal washington remained baffled why the dutch were so inexplicably enamored of an obviously hopeless cause


 united nations trust territories 

when the united nations was formed in 1945 it established trust territories these territories included the league of nations mandate territories which had not achieved independence by 1945 along with the former italian somaliland the trust territory of the pacific islands was transferred from japanese to us administration by 1990 all but one of the trust territories had achieved independence either as independent states or by merger with another independent state the northern mariana islands elected to become a commonwealth of the united states


 the emergence of the third world 1945–present 

the term third world was coined by french demographer alfred sauvy in 1952 on the model of the third estate which according to abbé sieyès represented everything but was nothing because at the end this ignored exploited scorned third world like the third estate wants to become something too sauvy the emergence of this new political entity in the frame of the cold war was complex and painful several tentatives were made to organize newly independent states in order to oppose a common front towards both the uss and the ussrs influence on them with the consequences of the sino-soviet split already at works thus the non-aligned movement constituted itself around the main figures of jawaharlal nehru the first prime minister of india sukarno the indonesian president josip broz tito the communist leader of yugoslavia and gamal abdel nasser head of egypt who successfully opposed the french and british imperial powers during the 1956 suez crisis after the 1954 geneva conference which put an end to the first indochina war the 1955 bandung conference gathered nasser nehru tito sukarno the leader of indonesia and zhou enlai premier of the peoples republic of china in 1960 the un general assembly voted the declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples the next year the non-aligned movement was officially created in belgrade 1961 and was followed in 1964 by the creation of the united nations conference on trade and development unctad which tried to promote a new international economic order nieo the nieo was opposed to the 1944 bretton woods system which had benefited the leading states which had created it and remained in force until 1971 after the united states suspension of convertibility from dollars to gold the main tenets of the nieo were

developing countries must be entitled to regulate and control the activities of multinational corporations operating within their territory
they must be free to nationalize or expropriate foreign property on conditions favourable to them
they must be free to set up associations of primary commodities producers similar to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries created on september 17 1960 to protest pressure by major oil companies mostly owned by us british and dutch nationals to reduce oil prices and payments to producers all other states must recognize this right and refrain from taking economic military or political measures calculated to restrict it
international trade should be based on the need to ensure stable equitable and remunerative prices for raw materials generalized non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory tariff preferences as well as transfer of technology to developing countries and should provide economic and technical assistance without any strings attached
the unctad however wasnt very effective in implementing this new international economic order nieo and social and economic inequalities between industrialized countries and the third world kept on growing throughout the 1960s until the 21st century the 1973 oil crisis which followed the yom kippur war october 1973 was triggered by the opec which decided an embargo against the us and western countries causing a fourfold increase in the price of oil which lasted five months starting on october 17 1973 and ending on march 18 1974 opec nations then agreed on january 7 1975 to raise crude oil prices by 10 at that time opec nations – including many who had recently nationalised their oil industries – joined the call for a new international economic order to be initiated by coalitions of primary producers concluding the first opec summit in algiers they called for stable and just commodity prices an international food and agriculture program technology transfer from north to south and the democratization of the economic system but industrialized countries quickly began to look for substitutes to opec petroleum with the oil companies investing the majority of their research capital in the us and european countries or others politically sure countries the opec lost more and more influence on the world prices of oil
the second oil crisis occurred in the wake of the 1979 iranian revolution then the 1982 latin american debt crisis exploded in mexico first then argentina and brazil which proved unable to pay back their debts jeopardizing the existence of the international economic system
the 1990s were characterized by the prevalence of the washington consensus on neoliberal policies structural adjustment and shock therapies for the former communist states


 decolonization of africa 

the decolonization of north africa and sub- saharan africa took place in the mid-to-late 1950s very suddenly with little preparation there was widespread unrest and organized revolts especially in french algeria portuguese angola the belgian congo and british kenyain 1945 africa had four independent countries – egypt ethiopia liberia and south africa

 challenges 
typical challenges of decolonization include state-building nation-building and economic development


 state-building 

after independence the new states needed to establish or strengthen the institutions of a sovereign state – governments laws a military schools administrative systems and so on the amount of self-rule granted prior to independence and assistance from the colonial power andor international organizations after independence varied greatly between colonial powers and between individual coloniesexcept for a few absolute monarchies most post-colonial states are either republics or constitutional monarchies these new states had to devise constitutions electoral systems and other institutions of representative democracy


 nation-building 

nation-building is the process of creating a sense of identification with and loyalty to the state nation-building projects seek to replace loyalty to the old colonial power andor tribal or regional loyalties with loyalty to the new state elements of nation-building include creating and promoting symbols of the state like a flag and an anthem monuments official histories national sports teams codifying one or more indigenous official languages and replacing colonial place-names with local ones nation-building after independence often continues the work began by independence movements during the colonial period


 settled populations 
decolonization is not an easy matter in colonies where a large population of settlers lives particularly if they have been there for several generations this population in general was often repatriated often losing considerable property for instance the decolonization of algeria by france was particularly uneasy due to the large european population see also pied noir which largely evacuated to france when algeria became independent in zimbabwe former rhodesia president robert mugabe has starting in the 1990s targeted white african farmers and forcibly seized their property other ethnic minorities that are also the product of colonialism may pose problems as well a large indian community lived in uganda – as in most of east africa – as a result of britain colonizing both india and east africa as many indians had considerable wealth idi amin expelled them for domestic political gain


 economic development 

newly independent states also had to develop independent economic institutions – a national currency banks companies regulation tax systems etc
many colonies were serving as resource colonies which produced raw materials and agricultural products and as a captive market for goods manufactured in the colonizing country many decolonized countries created programs to promote industrialization some nationalized industries and infrastructure and some engaged in land reform to redistribute land to individual farmers or create collective farms
some decolonized countries maintain strong economic ties with the former colonial power the cfa franc is a currency shared by 14 countries in west and central africa mostly former french colonies the cfa franc is guaranteed by the french treasury
after independence many countries created regional economic associations to promote trade and economic development among neighboring countries including the association of southeast asian nations asean the economic community of west african states ecowas and the gulf cooperation council


 effects on the colonizers 
john kenneth galbraith argues that the post–world war ii decolonization was brought about for economic reasons in a journey through economic time he writes the engine of economic well-being was now within and between the advanced industrial countries domestic economic growth – as now measured and much discussed – came to be seen as far more important than the erstwhile colonial trade the economic effect in the united states from the granting of independence to the philippines was unnoticeable partly due to the bell trade act which allowed american monopoly in the economy of the philippines the departure of india and pakistan made small economic difference in the united kingdom dutch economists calculated that the economic effect from the loss of the great dutch empire in indonesia was compensated for by a couple of years or so of domestic post-war economic growth the end of the colonial era is celebrated in the history books as a triumph of national aspiration in the former colonies and of benign good sense on the part of the colonial powers lurking beneath as so often happens was a strong current of economic interest – or in this case disinterest
in general the release of the colonized caused little economic loss to the colonizers part of the reason for this was that major costs were eliminated while major benefits were obtained by alternate means decolonization allowed the colonizer to disclaim responsibility for the colonized the colonizer no longer had the burden of obligation financial or otherwise to their colony however the colonizer continued to be able to obtain cheap goods and labor as well as economic benefits see suez canal crisis from the former colonies financial political and military pressure could still be used to achieve goals desired by the colonizer thus decolonization allowed the goals of colonization to be largely achieved but without its burdens


 effects on the former colonies 


 post-colonial organizations 

due to a common history and culture former colonial powers created institutions which more loosely associated their former colonies  membership is voluntary and in some cases can be revoked if a member state loses some objective criteria usually a requirement for democratic governance  the organizations serve cultural economic and political purposes between the associated countries although no such organization has become politically prominent as an entity in its own right
