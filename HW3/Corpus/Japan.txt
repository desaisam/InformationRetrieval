 etymology 

the japanese word for japan is 日本 which is pronounced nihon or nippon and literally means the origin of the sun the character nichi 日 means sun or day hon 本 means base or origin the compound therefore means origin of the sun and is the source of the popular western epithet land of the rising sunthe earliest record of the name nihon appears in the chinese historical records of the tang dynasty the old book of tang at the end of the seventh century a delegation from japan requested that nihon be used as the name of their country this name may have its origin in a letter sent in 607 and recorded in the official history of the sui dynasty prince shōtoku the regent of japan sent a mission to china with a letter in which he called himself the emperor of the land where the sun rises 日出處天子 the message said here i the emperor of the country where the sun rises send a letter to the emperor of the country where the sun sets how are you

prior to the adoption of nihon other terms such as yamato 大和 or great wa and wakoku 倭国 were used the term wa 和 is a homophone of wo 倭 pronounced wa by the japanese which has been used by the chinese as a designation for the japanese as early as the third century three kingdoms period another form of wa 委 wei in chinese was used for an early state in japan called nakoku during the han dynasty however the japanese disliked some connotation of wa 倭 which has been associated in china with concepts like dwarf or pygmy and it was therefore replaced with the substitute character wa 和 meaning togetherness harmonythe english word japan possibly derives from the historical chinese pronunciation of 日本 the old mandarin or possibly early wu chinese pronunciation of japan was recorded by marco polo as cipangu in modern shanghainese a wu dialect the pronunciation of characters 日本 japan is zeppen zəʔpən the old malay word for japan japun or japang was borrowed from a southern coastal chinese dialect probably fukienese or ningpo – and this malay word was encountered by portuguese traders in southeast asia in the 16th century these early portuguese traders then brought the word to europe the first record of this name in english is in a book published in 1577 and spelled giapan in a translation of a 1565 letter written by a portuguese jesuit luís fróisfrom the meiji restoration until the end of world war ii the full title of japan was dai nippon teikoku 大日本帝國 meaning the empire of great japan today the name nihon-kokunippon-koku 日本国 is used as a formal modern-day equivalent with the meaning of the state of japan countries like japan whose long form does not contain a descriptive designation are generally given a name appended by the character koku 国 meaning country nation or state


 history 


 prehistory and ancient history 

a paleolithic culture around 30,000 bc constitutes the first known habitation of the japanese archipelago this was followed from around 14,000 bc the start of the jōmon period by a mesolithic to neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture including by ancestors of contemporary ainu people and yamato people decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world around 300 bc the yayoi people began to enter the japanese islands intermingling with the jōmon the yayoi period starting around 500 bc saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming a new style of pottery and metallurgy introduced from china and koreajapan first appears in written history in the chinese book of han according to the records of the three kingdoms the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the third century was called yamataikoku buddhism was introduced to japan from baekje korea and was promoted by prince shōtoku but the subsequent development of japanese buddhism was primarily influenced by china despite early resistance buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the asuka period 592–710 due to the defeat in battle of baekgang by chinese tang empire japanese government devised and implemented the far-reaching taika reforms the reform began with land reform based on confucian ideas and philosophies from china it nationalized all land in japan to be distributed equally among cultivators and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation the true aim of the reforms was to bring about greater centralization and to enhance the power of the imperial court which was also based on the governmental structure of china envoys and students were dispatched to china to learn seemingly everything from the chinese writing system literature religion and architecture to even dietary habits at this time even today the impact of the reforms can still be seen in japanese cultural lifeafter the reforms the jinshin war of 672 a bloody conflict between prince ōama and his nephew prince ōtomo two rivals to the throne became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms these reforms culminated with the promulgation of the taihō code which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central government and its subordinate local governments these legal reforms created the ritsuryō state a system of chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millenniumthe nara period 710–784 marked an emergence of the centralized japanese state centered on the imperial court in heijō-kyō modern nara the nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literature as well as the development of buddhist-inspired art and architecture the smallpox epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of japans population in 784 emperor kanmu moved the capital from nara to nagaoka-kyō then to heian-kyō modern kyoto in 794
this marked the beginning of the heian period 794–1185 during which a distinctly indigenous japanese culture emerged noted for its art poetry and prose murasaki shikibus the tale of genji and the lyrics of japans national anthem kimigayo were written during this timebuddhism began to spread during the heian era chiefly through two major sects tendai by saichō and shingon by kūkai pure land buddhism jōdo-shū jōdo shinshū became greatly popular in the latter half of the 11th century


 feudal era 

japans feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors the samurai in 1185 following the defeat of the taira clan in the genpei war sung in the epic tale of heike samurai minamoto no yoritomo was appointed shōgun by emperor go-toba and yoritomo established a base of power in kamakura after his death the hōjō clan came to power as regents for the shōguns the zen school of buddhism was introduced from china in the kamakura period 1185–1333 and became popular among the samurai class the kamakura shogunate repelled mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by emperor go-daigo emperor go-daigo was himself defeated by ashikaga takauji in 1336
ashikaga takauji established the shogunate in muromachi kyoto this was the start of the muromachi period 1336–1573 the ashikaga shogunate achieved glory at the age of ashikaga yoshimitsu and the culture based on zen buddhism the art of miyabi prospered this evolved to higashiyama culture and prospered until the 16th century on the other hand the succeeding ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords daimyōs and a civil war the ōnin war began in 1467 opening the century-long sengoku period warring statesduring the 16th century portuguese traders and jesuit missionaries like the spanish francis xavier reached japan for the first time initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between japan and the west this allowed oda nobunaga to obtain european technology and firearms which he used to conquer many other daimyōs his consolidation of power began what was known as the azuchi–momoyama period 1573–1603 after nobunaga was assassinated in 1582 by akechi mitsuhide his successor toyotomi hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590 and launched two unsuccessful invasions of korea in 1592 and 1597
tokugawa ieyasu served as regent for hideyoshis son and used his position to gain political and military support when open war broke out ieyasu defeated rival clans in the battle of sekigahara in 1600 tokugawa ieyasu was appointed shōgun by emperor go-yōzei in 1603 and established the tokugawa shogunate in edo modern tokyo the shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimyōs and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku closed country policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the edo period 1603–1868 the study of western sciences known as rangaku continued through contact with the dutch enclave at dejima in nagasaki the edo period also gave rise to kokugaku national studies the study of japan by the japanese


 modern era 

on march 31 1854 commodore matthew perry and the black ships of the united states navy forced the opening of japan to the outside world with the convention of kanagawa subsequent similar treaties with western countries in the bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises the resignation of the shōgun led to the boshin war and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor the meiji restorationplunging itself through an active process of westernization during the meiji restoration in 1868 japan adopted western political judicial and military institutions and western cultural influences integrated with its traditional culture for modern industrialization the cabinet organized the privy council introduced the meiji constitution and assembled the imperial diet the meiji restoration transformed the empire of japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence although france and britain showed some interest the european powers largely ignored japan and instead concentrated on the much greater attractions of china france was also set back by its failures in mexico and defeat by the germans after victories in the first sino-japanese war 1894–1895 and the russo-japanese war 1904–1905 japan gained control of taiwan korea and the southern half of sakhalin in addition to imperialistic success japan also invested much more heavily in its own economic growth leading to a period of economic flourishing in the country which lasted until the great depression japans population grew from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million in 1935

in world war i japan joined the allies and captured german possessions and made advances into china the early 20th century saw a period of taishō democracy 1912–1926 but the 1920s saw a fragile democracy buckle under a political shift towards statism the passing of laws against political dissent and a series of attempted coups this process accelerated during the 1930s spawning a number of new radical nationalist groups which shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in asia japanese expansionism and militarization along with the totalitarianism and ultranationalism reshaped the country in 1931 japan invaded and occupied manchuria and following international condemnation of this occupation it quit the league of nations in 1933 in 1936 japan signed the anti-comintern pact with germany and the 1940 tripartite pact made it one of the axis powers

the empire of japan invaded other parts of china in 1937 precipitating the second sino-japanese war 1937–1945 the imperial japanese army swiftly captured the capital nanjing and conducted the nanjing massacre in 1940 the empire invaded french indochina after which the united states placed an oil embargo on japan on december 7–8 1941 japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on pearl harbor british forces in malaya singapore and hong kong and declared war on the united states and the british empire bringing the united states and the united kingdom into world war ii in the pacific after allied victories across the pacific during the next four years which culminated in the soviet invasion of manchuria and the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on august 15 the war cost japan its colonies china and the wars other combatants tens of millions of lives and left much of japans industry and infrastructure destroyed the allies led by the united states repatriated millions of ethnic japanese from colonies and military camps throughout asia largely eliminating the japanese empire and restoring the independence of its conquered territories the allies also convened the international military tribunal for the far east on may 3 1946 to prosecute some senior generals for war crimes
in 1947 japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices the allied occupation ended with the treaty of san francisco in 1952 and japan was granted membership in the united nations in 1956 japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest economy in the world until surpassed by china in 2010 this ended in the mid-1990s when japan suffered a major recession in the beginning of the 21st century positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery on march 11 2011 japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history this triggered the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power

the islands of japan are located in a volcanic zone on the pacific ring of fire they are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-silurian to the pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the philippine sea plate beneath the continental amurian plate and okinawa plate to the south and subduction of the pacific plate under the okhotsk plate to the north the boso triple junction off the coast of japan is a triple junction where the north american plate the pacific plate and the philippine sea plate meets japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the eurasian continent the subducting plates pulled japan eastward opening the sea of japan around 15 million years agojapan has 108 active volcanoes during the twentieth century several new volcanoes emerged including shōwa-shinzan on hokkaido and myōjin-shō off the bayonnaise rocks in the pacific destructive earthquakes often resulting in tsunami occur several times each century the 1923 tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people more recent major quakes are the 1995 great hanshin earthquake and the 2011 tōhoku earthquake a 9.1-magnitude quake which hit japan on march 11 2011 and triggered a large tsunami japan is substantially prone to earthquakes tsunami and volcanoes due to its location along the pacific ring of fire it has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 world risk index

 biodiversity 

japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands they range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the ryūkyū and bonin islands to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands to temperate coniferous forests in the cold winter portions of the northern islands japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife including the brown bear the japanese macaque the japanese raccoon dog the large japanese field mouse and the japanese giant salamander a large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven ramsar wetland sites four sites have been inscribed on the unesco world heritage list for their outstanding natural value


 environment 

in the period of rapid economic growth after world war ii environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations as a result environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s responding to rising concern about the problem the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970 the oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of japans lack of natural resources current environmental issues include urban air pollution nox suspended particulate matter and toxics waste management water eutrophication nature conservation climate change chemical management and international co-operation for conservationas of  june 2015 more than 40 coal-fired power plants are planned or under construction in japan following the switching-off of japans nuclear fleet following the 2011 fukushima nuclear disaster prior to this incident japans emissions had been on the decline largely due to nuclear power plants creating no emissions the ngo climate action network announced japan as the winner of its fossil of the day award for doing the most to block progress on climate actionjapan ranks 20th in the 2018 environmental performance index which measures a nations commitment to environmental sustainability as the host and signatory of the 1997 kyoto protocol japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change

japans relationship with south korea has been strained due to japans treatment of koreans during japanese colonial rule particularly over the issue of comfort women these women were essentially sex slaves and although there is no exact number on how many women were subjected to this treatment experts believe it could be in the tens or hundreds of thousands between 1910 and 1945 the japanese government rebuilt korean infrastructure despite this modernization in korea was always linked to japanese interests and therefore did not imply a revolutionization of social structures for instance japan kept koreas primitive feudalistic agriculture because it served japanese interests further developments on japans imperialism in korea included establishing a slew of police stations all over the country replacing taxes in kind with taxes in fixed money and taking much of the communal land which had belonged to villages to give them to private companies in japan causing many peasants to lose their land japan also introduced over 800,000 japanese immigrants onto the peninsula and carried out a campaign of cultural suppression through efforts to ban the korean language in schools and force koreans to adopt japanese namesthe korean peninsula once again became independent with the surrender of japan and the axis at the end of wwii in 1945 despite their historical tensions in december 2015 japan agreed to settle the comfort women dispute with south korea by issuing a formal apology taking responsibility for the issue and paying money to the surviving comfort women today south korea and japan have a stronger and more economically-driven relationship since the 1990s the korean wave has created a large fanbase in east asia japan is the number one importer of korean music k-pop television k-dramas and films but this was only made possible after the south korean government lifted the 30-year ban on cultural exchange with japan that had been in place since 1948korean pop cultural products success in the japanese market is partially explained by the borrowing of japanese ideas such as the star-marketing system and heavy promotion of new television shows and music korean dramas such as winter sonata and coffee prince as well as k-pop artists such as bigbang and shinee are very popular with japanese consumers most recently south korean president moon jae-in met with japanese prime minister shinzo abe at the 2017 g-20 summit in hamburg germany to discuss the future of their relationship and specifically how to cooperate on finding solutions for north korean aggression in the region both leaders restated their commitment to solving the comfort women dispute building positive relations in the region and pressuring china to be more assertive with north korea as it continues to test nuclear weapons and isolate themselves further form the international community

modern japans economic growth began in the edo period some of the surviving elements of the edo period are roads and water transportation routes as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts banking and insurance of the osaka rice brokers during the meiji period from 1868 japan expanded economically with the embrace of the market economy many of todays enterprises were founded at the time and japan emerged as the most developed nation in asia the period of overall real economic growth from the 1960s to the 1980s has been called the japanese post-war economic miracle it averaged 7.5 percent in the 1960s and 1970s and 3.2 percent in the 1980s and early 1990sgrowth slowed in the 1990s during the lost decade due to after-effects of the japanese asset price bubble and government policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets efforts to revive economic growth were unsuccessful and further hampered by the global slowdown in 2000 the economy recovered after 2005 gdp growth for that year was 2.8 percent surpassing the growth rates of the us and european union during the same periodtoday japan ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom it is ranked sixth in the global competitiveness report for 2015–2016


 agriculture and fishery 

the japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.4% of the total countrys gdp only 12% of japans land is suitable for cultivation due to this lack of arable land a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas this results in one of the worlds highest levels of crop yields per unit area with an overall agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% on fewer than 56,000 square kilometres 14,000,000 acres cultivated
japans small agricultural sector however is also highly subsidized and protected with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in north america there has been a growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successorsrice accounts for almost all of japans cereal production japan is the second-largest agricultural product importer in the world rice the most protected crop is subject to tariffs of 777.7in 1996 japan ranked fourth in the world in tonnage of fish caught japan captured 4,074,580 metric tons of fish in 2005 down from 4,987,703 tons in 2000 9,558,615 tons in 1990 9,864,422 tons in 1980 8,520,397 tons in 1970 5,583,796 tons in 1960 and 2,881,855 tons in 1950 in 2003 the total aquaculture production was predicted at 1,301,437 tonnes in 2010 japans total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50% of the nations total fish catches in the late 1980s although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period

during the meiji restoration of 1868 the history of japanese architecture was radically changed by two important events the first was the kami and buddhas separation act of 1868 which formally separated buddhism from shinto and buddhist temples from shinto shrines breaking an association between the two which had lasted well over a thousand yearssecond it was then that japan underwent a period of intense westernization in order to compete with other developed countries initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style architects returning from study with western architects introduced the international style of modernism into japan however it was not until after the second world war that japanese architects made an impression on the international scene firstly with the work of architects like kenzō tange and then with theoretical movements like metabolism
