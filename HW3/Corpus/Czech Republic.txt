 name 

the traditional english name bohemia derives from latin boiohaemum which means home of the boii  the current english name comes from the polish ethnonym associated with the area which ultimately comes from the czech word čech the name comes from the slavic tribe czech češi čechové and according to legend their leader čech who brought them to bohemia to settle on říp mountain the etymology of the word čech can be traced back to the proto-slavic root čel- meaning member of the people kinsman thus making it cognate to the czech word člověk a personthe country has been traditionally divided into three lands namely bohemia čechy in the west moravia morava in the east and czech silesia slezsko the smaller south-eastern part of historical silesia most of which is located within modern poland in the northeast known as the lands of the bohemian crown since the 14th century a number of other names for the country have been used including czechbohemian lands bohemian crown czechia  and the lands of the crown of saint wenceslas when the country regained its independence after the dissolution of the austro-hungarian empire in 1918 the new name of czechoslovakia was coined to reflect the union of the czech and slovak nations within the one country
after czechoslovakia dissolved in 1992 the czech part lacked a common english short name the czech ministry of foreign affairs recommended the english name czechia in 1993 and the czech government approved czechia as the official short name in 2016


 history 


 prehistory 

archaeologists have found evidence of prehistoric human settlements in the area dating back to the paleolithic era the venus of dolní věstonice together with a few others from nearby locations found here is the oldest known ceramic article in the world
in the classical era from the 3rd century bc celtic migrations the boii and later in the 1st century the germanic tribes of the marcomanni and quadi settled there their king maroboduus is the first documented ruler of bohemia during the migration period around the 5th century many germanic tribes moved westwards and southwards out of central europe
slavs from the black sea–carpathian region settled in the area a movement that was also stimulated by the onslaught of peoples from siberia and eastern europe huns avars bulgars and magyars in the sixth century they moved westwards into bohemia moravia and some of present-day austria and germany
during the 7th century the frankish merchant samo supporting the slavs fighting against nearby settled avars became the ruler of the first known slavic state in central europe samos empire the principality of great moravia controlled by moymir dynasty arose in the 8th century and reached its zenith in the 9th during the reign of svatopluk i of moravia when it held off the influence of the franks great moravia was christianized with a crucial role being played by the byzantine mission of cyril and methodius they created the artificial language old church slavonic the first literary and liturgic language of the slavs and the glagolitic alphabet


 bohemia 

the duchy of bohemia emerged in the late 9th century when it was unified by the přemyslid dynasty in 10th century boleslaus i duke of bohemia conquered moravia silesia and expanded farther to the east the duchy of bohemia raised to the kingdom of bohemia in 1198 was from 1002 until 1806 an imperial state of the holy roman empire alongside the kingdom of germany the kingdom of burgundy the kingdom of italy and numerous other territories such as the old swiss confederacy and various papal states the kingdom was a significant regional power during the middle ages
in 1212 king přemysl ottokar i bearing the title king from 1198 extracted the golden bull of sicily a formal edict from the emperor confirming ottokar and his descendants royal status the duchy of bohemia was raised to a kingdom the bull declared that the king of bohemia would be exempt from all future obligations to the holy roman empire except for participation in imperial councils german immigrants settled in the bohemian periphery in the 13th century germans populated towns and mining districts and in some cases formed german colonies in the interior of bohemia in 1235 the mongols launched an invasion of europe after the battle of legnica in poland the mongols carried their raids into moravia but were defensively defeated at the fortified town of olomouc the mongols subsequently invaded and defeated hungary

king přemysl otakar ii earned the nickname iron and golden king because of his military power and wealth he acquired austria styria carinthia and carniola thus spreading the bohemian territory to the adriatic sea he met his death at the battle on the marchfeld in 1278 in a war with his rival king rudolph i of germany ottokars son wenceslaus ii acquired the polish crown in 1300 for himself and the hungarian crown for his son he built a great empire stretching from the danube river to the baltic sea in 1306 the last king of přemyslid line wenceslaus iii was murdered in mysterious circumstances in olomouc while he was resting after a series of dynastic wars the house of luxembourg gained the bohemian thronethe 14th century in particular the reign of the bohemian king charles iv 1316–1378 who in 1346 became king of the romans and in 1354 both king of italy and holy roman emperor is considered the golden age of czech history of particular significance was the founding of charles university in prague in 1348 charles bridge charles square much of prague castle and the cathedral of saint vitus in gothic style were completed during his reign he unified brandenburg until 1415 lusatia until 1635 and silesia until 1742 under the bohemian crown the black death which had raged in europe from 1347 to 1352 decimated the kingdom of bohemia in 1380 killing about 10% of the population

bohemian reformation started around 1402 by jan hus although hus was named a heretic and burnt in constance in 1415 his followers led by warlords jan žižka and prokop the great seceded from the catholic church and in the hussite wars 1419–1434 defeated five crusades organized against them by the holy roman emperor sigismund petr chelčický continued with the hussite movement during the next two centuries 90% of the population in bohemian and moravian lands were considered hussites hussite george of podebrady was even a king huss thoughts were a major influence on the later lutheranism martin luther himself said we are all hussites without having been aware of it and considered himself as huss direct successor

after 1526 bohemia came increasingly under habsburg control as the habsburgs became first the elected and then in 1627 the hereditary rulers of bohemia the austrian habsburgs of the 16th century the founders of the central european habsburg monarchy were buried in prague between 1583–1611 prague was the official seat of the holy roman emperor rudolf ii and his court
the defenestration of prague and subsequent revolt against the habsburgs in 1618 marked the start of the thirty years war which quickly spread throughout central europe in 1620 the rebellion in bohemia was crushed at the battle of white mountain and the ties between bohemia and the habsburgs hereditary lands in austria were strengthened the leaders of the bohemian revolt were executed in 1621 the nobility and the middle class protestants had to either convert to catholicism or leave the countrythe following period from 1620 to the late 18th century has often been called colloquially the dark age the population of the czech lands declined by a third through the expulsion of czech protestants as well as due to the war disease and famine the habsburgs prohibited all christian confessions other than catholicism the flowering of baroque culture shows the ambiguity of this historical period
ottoman turks and tatars invaded moravia in 1663 in 1679–1680 the czech lands faced the devastating great plague of vienna and an uprising of serfs

the reigns of maria theresa of austria and her son joseph ii holy roman emperor and co-regent from 1765 were characterized by enlightened absolutism in 1740 most of silesia except the southernmost area was seized by king frederick ii of prussia in the silesian wars in 1757 the prussians invaded bohemia and after the battle of prague 1757 occupied the city more than one quarter of prague was destroyed and st vitus cathedral also suffered heavy damage frederick was defeated soon after at the battle of kolín and had to leave prague and retreat from bohemia in 1770 and 1771 great famine killed about one tenth of the czech population or 250,000 inhabitants and radicalized the countryside leading to peasant uprisings serfdom was abolished in two steps between 1781 and 1848 several large battles of the napoleonic wars – battle of austerlitz battle of kulm – took place on the current territory of the czech republic joseph radetzky von radetz born to a noble czech family was a field marshal and chief of the general staff of the austrian empire army during these wars
the end of the holy roman empire in 1806 led to degradation of the political status of the kingdom of bohemia bohemia lost its position of an electorate of the holy roman empire as well as its own political representation in the imperial diet bohemian lands became part of the austrian empire and later of austria–hungary during the 18th and 19th century the czech national revival began its rise with the purpose to revive czech language culture and national identity the revolution of 1848 in prague striving for liberal reforms and autonomy of the bohemian crown within the austrian empire was suppressed

in 1866 austria was defeated by prussia in the austro-prussian war see also battle of königgrätz and peace of prague the austrian empire needed to redefine itself to maintain unity in the face of nationalism at first it seemed that some concessions would be made also to bohemia but in the end the emperor franz joseph i effected a compromise with hungary only the austro-hungarian compromise of 1867 and the never realized coronation of franz joseph as king of bohemia led to a huge disappointment of czech politicians the bohemian crown lands became part of the so-called cisleithania officially the kingdoms and lands represented in the imperial council
prague pacifist bertha von suttner was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1905 in the same year the czech social democratic and progressive politicians including tomáš garrigue masaryk started the fight for universal suffrage the first elections under universal male suffrage were held in 1907 the last king of bohemia was charles i of austria who ruled in 1916–1918


 czechoslovakia 

an estimated 1.4 million czech soldiers fought in world war i of whom some 150,000 died although the majority of czech soldiers fought for the austro-hungarian empire more than 90,000 czech volunteers formed the czechoslovak legions in france italy and russia where they fought against the central powers and later against bolshevik troops in 1918 during the collapse of the habsburg empire at the end of world war i the independent republic of czechoslovakia which joined the winning allied powers was created with tomáš garrigue masaryk in the lead this new country incorporated the bohemian crown bohemia moravia and silesia and parts of the kingdom of hungary slovakia and the carpathian ruthenia with significant german hungarian polish and ruthenian speaking minorities czechoslovakia concluded a treaty of alliance with romania and yugoslavia the so-called little entente and particularly with france
the first czechoslovak republic comprised only 27% of the population of the former austria-hungary but nearly 80% of the industry which enabled it to successfully compete with western industrial states in 1929 compared to 1913 the gross domestic product increased by 52% and industrial production by 41 in 1938 czechoslovakia held a 10th place in the world industrial productionalthough the first czechoslovak republic was a unitary state it provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities and remained the only democracy in this part of europe in the interwar period the effects of the great depression including high unemployment and massive propaganda from nazi germany however resulted in discontent and strong support among ethnic germans for a break from czechoslovakia

adolf hitler took advantage of this opportunity and using konrad henleins separatist sudeten german party gained the largely german speaking sudetenland and its substantial maginot line-like border fortifications through the 1938 munich agreement signed by nazi germany france britain and italy czechoslovakia was not invited to the conference and czechs and slovaks call the munich agreement the munich betrayal because france which had an alliance with czechoslovakia and britain gave up czechoslovakia instead of facing hitler which later proved inevitable
despite the mobilization of 1.2 million-strong czechoslovak army and the franco-czech military alliance poland annexed the zaolzie area around český těšín hungary gained parts of slovakia and the subcarpathian rus as a result of the first vienna award in november 1938 the remainders of slovakia and the subcarpathian rus gained greater autonomy with the state renamed to czecho-slovakia after nazi germany threatened to annex part of slovakia allowing the remaining regions to be partitioned by hungary and poland slovakia chose to maintain its national and territorial integrity seceding from czecho-slovakia in march 1939 and allying itself as demanded by germany with hitlers coalition

the remaining czech territory was occupied by germany which transformed it into the so-called protectorate of bohemia and moravia the protectorate was proclaimed part of the third reich and the president and prime minister were subordinated to the nazi germanys reichsprotektor subcarpathian rus declared independence as the republic of carpatho-ukraine on 15 march 1939 but was invaded by hungary the same day and formally annexed the next day approximately 345,000 czechoslovak citizens including 277,000 jews were killed or executed while hundreds of thousands of others were sent to prisons and nazi concentration camps or used as forced labor up to two-thirds of the citizens were in groups targeted by the nazis for deportation or death one concentration camp was located within the czech territory at terezín north of prague the nazi generalplan ost called for the extermination expulsion germanization or enslavement of most or all czechs for the purpose of providing more living space for the german peoplethere was czech resistance to nazi occupation both at home and abroad most notably with the assassination of nazi german leader reinhard heydrich by czechoslovakian soldiers jozef gabčík and jan kubiš in a prague suburb on 27 may 1942 on 9 june 1942 hitler ordered bloody reprisals against the czechs as a response to the czech anti-nazi resistance the edvard benešs czechoslovak government-in-exile and its army fought against the germans and were acknowledged by the allies czechczechoslovak troops fought from the very beginning of the war in poland france the uk north africa the middle east and the soviet union see i czechoslovakian corps the german occupation ended on 9 may 1945 with the arrival of the soviet and american armies and the prague uprising an estimated 140,000 soviet soldiers died in liberating czechoslovakia from german rule

in 1945–1946 almost the entire german-speaking minority in czechoslovakia about 3 million people were expelled to germany and austria see also beneš decrees during this time thousands of germans were held in prisons and detention camps or used as forced labor in the summer of 1945 there were several massacres such as the postoloprty massacre research by a joint german and czech commission of historians in 1995 found that the death toll of the expulsions was at least 15,000 persons and that it could range up to a maximum of 30,000 dead the only germans not expelled were some 250,000 who had been active in the resistance against the nazi germans or were considered economically important though many of these emigrated later following a soviet-organized referendum the subcarpathian rus never returned under czechoslovak rule but became part of the ukrainian soviet socialist republic as the zakarpattia oblast in 1946
czechoslovakia uneasily tried to play the role of a bridge between the west and east however the communist party of czechoslovakia rapidly increased in popularity with a general disillusionment with the west because of the pre-war munich agreement and a favourable popular attitude towards the soviet union because of the soviets role in liberating czechoslovakia from german rule in the 1946 elections the communists gained 38% of the votes and became the largest party in the czechoslovak parliament they formed a coalition government with other parties of the national front and moved quickly to consolidate power a significant change came in 1948 with coup détat by the communist party the communist peoples militias secured control of key locations in prague and a single party government was formed

for the next 41 years czechoslovakia was a communist state within the eastern bloc this period is characterized by lagging behind the west in almost every aspect of social and economic development the countrys gdp per capita fell from the level of neighboring austria below that of greece or portugal in the 1980s the communist government completely nationalized the means of production and established a command economy the economy grew rapidly during the 1950s but slowed down in the 1960s and 1970s and stagnated in the 1980s
the political climate was highly repressive during the 1950s including numerous show trials the most famous victims milada horáková and rudolf slánský and hundreds of thousands of political prisoners but became more open and tolerant in the late 1960s culminating in alexander dubčeks leadership in the 1968 prague spring which tried to create socialism with a human face and perhaps even introduce political pluralism this was forcibly ended by invasion by all warsaw pact member countries with the exception of romania and albania on 21 august 1968 student jan palach became a symbol of resistance to the occupation when he committed self-immolation as a political protest
the invasion was followed by a harsh program of normalization in the late 1960s and the 1970s until 1989 the political establishment relied on censorship of the opposition dissidents published charter 77 in 1977 and the first of a new wave of protests were seen in 1988 between 1948 and 1989 about 250,000 czechs and slovaks were sent to prison for political reasons and over 400,000 emigrated


 velvet revolution and the european union 

in november 1989 czechoslovakia returned to a liberal democracy through the peaceful velvet revolution led by václav havel and his civic forum however slovak national aspirations strengthened see hyphen war and on 1 january 1993 the country peacefully split into the independent czech republic and slovakia both countries went through economic reforms and privatisations with the intention of creating a market economy this process was largely successful in 2006 the czech republic was recognized by the world bank as a developed country and in 2009 the human development index ranked it as a nation of very high human developmentfrom 1991 the czech republic originally as part of czechoslovakia and since 1993 in its own right has been a member of the visegrád group and from 1995 the oecd the czech republic joined nato on 12 march 1999 and the european union on 1 may 2004 on 21 december 2007 the czech republic joined the schengen area until 2017 either the social democrats under miloš zeman vladimír špidla stanislav gross jiří paroubek and bohuslav sobotka or liberal-conservatives under václav klaus mirek topolánek and petr nečas led the government of the czech republic
