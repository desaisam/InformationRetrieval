indigenous peoples also known as first peoples aboriginal peoples or native peoples are ethnic groups who are the original settlers of a given region in contrast to groups that have settled occupied or colonized the area more recently groups are usually described as indigenous when they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture that is associated with a given region not all indigenous peoples share this characteristic as many have adopted substantial elements of a colonizing culture such as dress religion or language indigenous peoples may be settled in a given region sedentary or exhibit a nomadic lifestyle across a large territory but they are generally historically associated with a specific territory on which they depend indigenous societies are found in every inhabited climate zone and continent of the worldsince indigenous peoples are often faced with threats to their sovereignty economic well-being and their access to the resources on which their cultures depend political rights have been set forth in international law by international organizations such as the united nations the international labour organization and the world bank the united nations has issued a declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples undrip to guide member-state national policies to the collective rights of indigenous peoples such as culture identity language and access to employment health education and natural resources estimates put the total population of indigenous peoples from 220 million to 350 millioninternational day of the worlds indigenous peoples is celebrated on 9 august each year


 definitions 
the adjective indigenous was historically used to describe animals and plant origins during the late twentieth century the term indigenous people began to be used to describe a legal category in indigenous law created in international and national legislations it refers to culturally distinct groups affected by colonization it is derived from the latin word indigena which is based on the root gen- to be born with an archaic form of the prefix in in any given people ethnic group or community may be described as indigenous in reference to some particular region or location that they see as their traditional indigenous land claim other terms used to refer to indigenous populations are aboriginal indigenous original or first as in canadas first peoples first nations inuit and métis
the use of the term peoples in association with the indigenous is derived from the 19th century anthropological and ethnographic disciplines that merriam-webster dictionary defines as a body of persons that are united by a common culture tradition or sense of kinship which typically have common language institutions and beliefs and often constitute a politically organized groupjames anaya former special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples has defined indigenous peoples as living descendants of pre-invasion inhabitants of lands now dominated by others they are culturally distinct groups that find themselves engulfed by other settler societies born of forces of empire and conquestthey form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories and their ethnic identity as the basis of their continued existence as peoples in accordance with their own cultural patterns social institutions and legal system the international day of the worlds indigenous people falls on 9 august as this was the date of the first meeting in 1982 of the united nations working group of indigenous populations of the subcommission on prevention of discrimination and protection of minorities of the commission on human rights


 national definitions 

throughout history different states designate the groups within their boundaries that are recognized as indigenous peoples according to international or national legislation by different terms indigenous people also include people indigenous based on their descent from populations that inhabited the country when non-indigenous religions and cultures arrived—or at the establishment of present state boundaries—who retain some or all of their own social economic cultural and political institutions but who may have been displaced from their traditional domains or who may have resettled outside their ancestral domains
the status of the indigenous groups in the subjugated relationship can be characterized in most instances as an effectively marginalized isolated or minimally participative one in comparison to majority groups or the nation-state as a whole their ability to influence and participate in the external policies that may exercise jurisdiction over their traditional lands and practices is very frequently limited this situation can persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some at least titular influence over aspects of their community and land rights
in a ground-breaking 1997 decision involving the ainu people of japan the japanese courts recognised their claim in law stating that if one minority group lived in an area prior to being ruled over by a majority group and preserved its distinct ethnic culture even after being ruled over by the majority group while another came to live in an area ruled over by a majority after consenting to the majority rule it must be recognised that it is only natural that the distinct ethnic culture of the former group requires greater considerationin russia definition of indigenous peoples is contested largely referring to a number of population less than 50 000 people and neglecting self-identification origin from indigenous populations who inhabited the country or region upon invasion colonization or establishment of state frontiers distinctive social economic and cultural institutions  thus indigenous people of russia such as sakha komi karelian and others are not considered as such due to the size of the population more than 50 000 people and consequently they are not the subjects of the specific legal protections the presence of external laws claims and cultural mores either potentially or actually act to variously constrain the practices and observances of an indigenous society these constraints can be observed even when the indigenous society is regulated largely by its own tradition and custom they may be purposefully imposed or arise as unintended consequence of trans-cultural interaction they may have a measurable effect even where countered by other external influences and actions deemed beneficial or that promote indigenous rights and interests


 united nations 
in 1982 the united nations working group on indigenous populations wgip accepted as a preliminary definition a formulation put forward by mr josé r martínez-cobo special rapporteur on discrimination against indigenous populations this definition has some limitations because the definition applies mainly to pre-colonial populations and would likely exclude other isolated or marginal societies
indigenous communities peoples and nations are those that having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing in those territories or parts of them they form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories and their ethnic identity as the basis of their continued existence as peoples in accordance with their own cultural patterns social institutions and legal systems
the primary impetus in considering indigenous identity comes from the post-colonial movements and considering the historical impacts on populations by the european imperialism the first paragraph of the introduction of a report published in 2009 by the secretariat of the permanent forum on indigenous issues published a report states for centuries since the time of their colonization conquest or occupation indigenous peoples have documented histories of resistance interface or cooperation with states thus demonstrating their conviction and determination to survive with their distinct sovereign identities indeed indigenous peoples were often recognized as sovereign peoples by states as witnessed by the hundreds of treaties concluded between indigenous peoples and the governments of the united states canada new zealand and others
in may 2016 the fifteenth session of the united nations permanent forum on indigenous issues unpfii affirmed that indigenous people also termed aboriginal people native people or autochthonous people are distinctive groups protected in international or national legislation as having a set of specific rights based on their linguistic and historical ties to a particular territory prior to later settlement development and or occupation of a region the session affirms that since indigenous peoples are vulnerable to exploitation marginalization oppression forced assimilation and genocide by nation states formed from colonizing populations or by politically dominant different ethnic groups special protection of individuals and communities maintaining ways of life indigenous to their regions are entitled to special protection


 history 


 classical antiquity 
greek sources of the classical period acknowledge the prior existence of indigenous peoples whom they referred to as pelasgians these peoples inhabited lands surrounding the aegean sea before the subsequent migrations of the hellenic ancestors claimed by these authors the disposition and precise identity of this former group is elusive and sources such as homer hesiod and herodotus give varying partially mythological accounts however it is clear that cultures existed whose indigenous characteristics were distinguished by the subsequent hellenic cultures and distinct from non-greek speaking foreigners termed barbarians by the historical greeks
greco-roman society flourished between 250 bc and 480 ad and commanded successive waves of conquests that gripped more than half of the globe but because already existent populations within other parts of europe at the time of classical antiquity had more in common culturally speaking with the greco-roman world the intricacies involved in expansion across the european frontier were not so contentious relative to indigenous issuesbut when it came to expansion in other parts of the world namely asia africa and the middle east then totally new cultural dynamics had entered into the equation so to speak and one sees here of what was to take the americas south east asia and the pacific by storm a few hundred years later the idea that peoples who possessed cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power is no new idea borne out of the medieval period or the enlightenment


 european expansion and colonialism 

the rapid and extensive spread of the various european powers from the early 15th century onwards had a profound impact upon many of the indigenous cultures with whom they came into contact the exploratory and colonial ventures in the americas africa asia and the pacific often resulted in territorial and cultural conflict and the intentional or unintentional displacement and devastation of the indigenous populations
encounters between explorers and indigenous populations in the rest of the world often introduced new infectious diseases which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence for example smallpox measles malaria yellow fever and others were unknown in pre-columbian america and australia
the canary islands had an indigenous population called the guanches whose origin is still the subject of discussion among historians and linguists


 population and distribution 

indigenous societies range from those who have been significantly exposed to the colonizing or expansionary activities of other societies such as the maya peoples of mexico and central america through to those who as yet remain in comparative isolation from any external influence such as the sentinelese and jarawa of the andaman islands
precise estimates for the total population of the worlds indigenous peoples are very difficult to compile given the difficulties in identification and the variances and inadequacies of available census data the united nations estimates that there are over 370 million indigenous people living in over 70 countries worldwide this would equate to just fewer than 6% of the total world population this includes at least 5000 distinct peoples in over 72 countries
contemporary distinct indigenous groups survive in populations ranging from only a few dozen to hundreds of thousands and more many indigenous populations have undergone a dramatic decline and even extinction and remain threatened in many parts of the world some have also been assimilated by other populations or have undergone many other changes in other cases indigenous populations are undergoing a recovery or expansion in numbers
certain indigenous societies survive even though they may no longer inhabit their traditional lands owing to migration relocation forced resettlement or having been supplanted by other cultural groups  in many other respects the transformation of culture of indigenous groups is ongoing and includes permanent loss of language loss of lands encroachment on traditional territories and disruption in traditional lifeways due to contamination and pollution of waters and lands


 indigenous peoples by region 

indigenous populations are distributed in regions throughout the globe the numbers condition and experience of indigenous groups may vary widely within a given region a comprehensive survey is further complicated by sometimes contentious membership and identification


 africa 

 
in the post-colonial period the concept of specific indigenous peoples within the african continent has gained wider acceptance although not without controversy the highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that comprise most modern independent african states contain within them various peoples whose situation cultures and pastoralist or hunter-gatherer lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct indigenous peoples in both national and international contexts
though the vast majority of african peoples are indigenous in the sense that they originate from that continent—in practice identity as an indigenous people per the modern definition is more restrictive and certainly not every african ethnic group claims identification under these terms groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances have been placed outside of the dominant state systems and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments companies and surrounding dominant societies
given the extensive and complicated history of human migration within africa being the first peoples in a land is not a necessary precondition for acceptance as an indigenous people rather indigenous identity relates more to a set of characteristics and practices than priority of arrival for example several populations of nomadic peoples such as the tuareg of the sahara and sahel regions now inhabit areas where they arrived comparatively recently their claim to indigenous status endorsed by the african commission on human and peoples rights is based on their marginalization as nomadic peoples in states and territories dominated by sedentary agricultural peoples


 americas 

indigenous peoples of the american continent are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of european colonizers and settlers ie pre-columbian indigenous peoples who maintain or seek to maintain traditional ways of life are found from the high arctic north to the southern extremities of tierra del fuego
the impact of european colonization of the americas on the indigenous communities has been in general quite severe with many authorities estimating ranges of significant population decline primarily due to disease but also violence the extent of this impact is the subject of much continuing debate several peoples shortly thereafter became extinct or very nearly so
all nations in north and south america have populations of indigenous peoples within their borders in some countries particularly latin american indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national population—in bolivia they account for an estimated 56–70% of the total nation and at least half of the population in guatemala and the andean and amazonian nations of peru in english indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as native americans amerindians and american indians in spanish or portuguese speaking countries one finds the use of terms such as pueblos indígenas amerindios povos nativos povos indígenas and in peru comunidades nativas native communities particularly among amazonian societies like the urarina and matsés in chile there are indigenous tribes like the mapuches in the center-south and the aymaras in the north also the rapa nui indigenous to easter island are a polynesian tribe
in brazil the term índio portuguese pronunciation ˈĩdʒiu or ˈĩdʒju is used by most of the population the media the indigenous peoples themselves and even the government funai is acronym for the fundação nacional do índio national indio foundation although its hispanic equivalent indio is widely not considered politically correct and falling into disuse

indigenous peoples in canada comprise the first nations inuit and métis the descriptors indian  and eskimo have fallen into disuse in canada there are currently over 600 recognized first nations governments or bands encompassing 1,272,790 2006 peoples spread across canada with distinctive aboriginal cultures languages art and music  national aboriginal day recognises the cultures and contributions of aboriginals to the history of canada
the inuit have achieved a degree of administrative autonomy with the creation in 1999 of the territories of nunavik in northern québec nunatsiavut in northern labrador and nunavut which was until 1999 a part of the northwest territories  the self-ruling danish territory of greenland is also home to a majority population of indigenous inuit about 85
in the united states the combined populations of native americans inuit and other indigenous designations totalled 2,786,652 constituting about 1.5% of 2003 us census figures some 563 scheduled tribes are recognized at the federal level and a number of others recognized at the state level
in mexico approximately 6,000,000 constituting about 6.7% of 2005 mexican census figures identify as indígenas spanish for natives or indigenous peoples in the southern states of chiapas yucatán and oaxaca they constitute 26.1 33.5% and 35.3 respectively of the population in these states several conflicts and episodes of civil war have been conducted in which the situation and participation of indigenous societies were notable factors see for example ezln

the amerindians make up 0.4% of all brazilian population or about 700,000 people indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of brazil although the majority of them live in indian reservations in the north and center-western part of the country on 18 january 2007 funai reported that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in brazil up from 40 in 2005 with this addition brazil has now overtaken the island of new guinea as the country having the largest number of uncontacted tribes

 eastern asia 
ainu people are an ethnic group indigenous to hokkaidō the kuril islands and much of sakhalin as japanese settlement expanded the ainu were pushed northward and fought against the japanese in shakushains revolt and menashi-kunashir rebellion until by the meiji period they were confined by the government to a small area in hokkaidō in a manner similar to the placing of native americans on reservationsthe dzungar oirats are indigenous to the dzungaria in northern xinjiang

 oceania 

in australia the indigenous populations are the aboriginal australians within which are many different nations and tribes and the torres strait islanders these groups are often spoken of as indigenous australians
many of the present-day pacific island nations in the oceania region were originally populated by polynesian melanesian and micronesian peoples over the course of thousands of years european colonial expansion in the pacific brought many of these under non-indigenous administration during the 20th century several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states were formed under local control however various peoples have put forward claims for indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration examples include the chamorros of guam and the northern marianas and the marshallese of the marshall islands
the remains of at least 25 miniature humans who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago were recently found on the islands of palau in micronesiain most parts of oceania indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants of colonists exceptions include new zealand and hawaii according to the 2013 census new zealand māori make up 14.9% of the population of new zealand with less than half 46.5 of all māori residents identifying solely as māori the māori are indigenous to polynesia and settled new zealand relatively recently the migrations were thought to have occurred in the 13th century ce in new zealand pre-contact māori tribes were not a single people thus the more recent grouping into tribal iwi arrangements has become a more formal arrangement in more recent times many māori tribal leaders signed a treaty with the british the treaty of waitangi which formed the modern geo-political entity that is new zealand
the independent state of papua new guinea png has a majority population of indigenous societies with more than 700 different tribal groups recognized out of a total population of 8 million the png constitution and other acts identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state however conflicts and disputes concerning land use and resource rights continue between indigenous groups the government and corporate entities


 indigenous rights and other issues 

indigenous peoples confront a diverse range of concerns associated with their status and interaction with other cultural groups as well as changes in their inhabited environment some challenges are specific to particular groups however other challenges are commonly experienced  these issues include cultural and linguistic preservation land rights ownership and exploitation of natural resources political determination and autonomy environmental degradation and incursion poverty health and discrimination
the interaction between indigenous and non-indigenous societies throughout history has been complex ranging from outright conflict and subjugation to some degree of mutual benefit and cultural transfer a particular aspect of anthropological study involves investigation into the ramifications of what is termed first contact the study of what occurs when two cultures first encounter one another the situation can be further confused when there is a complicated or contested history of migration and population of a given region which can give rise to disputes about primacy and ownership of the land and resources
wherever indigenous cultural identity is asserted common societal issues and concerns arise from the indigenous status these concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups despite the diversity of indigenous peoples it may be noted that they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing or invading society they are generally concerned that the cultures of indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies this is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat notable exceptions are the sakha and komi peoples two of the northern indigenous peoples of russia who now control their own autonomous republics within the russian state and the canadian inuit who form a majority of the territory of nunavut created in 1999 despite the control of their territories many sakha people have lost their lands as a result of the russian homestead act which allows any russian citizen to own any land in the far eastern region of russia in australia a landmark case mabo v queensland no 2 saw the high court of australia reject the idea of terra nullius this rejection ended up recognizing that there was a pre-existing system of law practiced by the meriam people
it is also sometimes argued that it is important for the human species as a whole to preserve a wide range of cultural diversity as possible and that the protection of indigenous cultures is vital to this enterprise


 human rights violations 
the bangladesh government has stated that there are no indigenous peoples in bangladesh this has angered the indigenous peoples of chittagong hill tracts bangladesh collectively known as the jumma experts have protested against this move of the bangladesh government and have questioned the governments definition of the term indigenous peoples this move by the bangladesh government is seen by the indigenous peoples of bangladesh as another step by the government to further erode their already limited rightsboth hindu and chams have experienced religious and ethnic persecution and restrictions on their faith under the current vietnamese government with the vietnamese state confisticating cham property and forbidding cham from observing their religious beliefs hindu temples were turned into tourist sites against the wishes of the cham hindus in 2010 and 2013 several incidents occurred in thành tín and phươc nhơn villages where cham were murdered by vietnamese in 2012 vietnamese police in chau giang village stormed into a cham mosque stole the electric generator and also raped cham girls cham  in the mekong delta have also been economically marginalised with ethnic vietnamese settling on land previously owned by cham people with state supportthe indonesian government has outright denied the existence of indigenous peoples within the countries borders in 2012 indonesia stated that ‘the government of indonesia supports the promotion and protection of indigenous people worldwide… indonesia however does not recognize the application of the indigenous peoples concept… in the country’ along with the brutal treatment of the countrys papuan people a conservative estimate places the violent deaths at 100,000 people in west new guinea since indonesian occupation in 1963 see papua conflict has led to survival international condemning indonesia for treating its indigenous peoples as the worst in the worldthe vietnamese viewed and dealt with the indigenous montagnards in the cidg from the central highlands as savages and this caused a montagnard uprising against the vietnamese the vietnamese were originally centered around the red river delta but engaged in conquest and seized new lands such as champa the mekong delta from cambodia  and the central highlands during nam tien while the vietnamese received strong chinese influence in their culture and civilization and were sinicized and the cambodians and laotians were indianized the montagnards in the central highlands maintained their own indigenous culture without adopting external culture and were the true indigenous  of the region and to hinder encroachment on the central highlands by vietnamese nationalists the term pays montagnard du sud-indochinois pmsi emerged for the central highlands along with the indigenous being addressed by the name montagnard the tremendous scale of vietnamese kinh colonists flooding into the central highlands has significantly altered the demographics of the region the anti-ethnic minority discriminatory policies by the vietnamese environmental degradation deprivation of lands from the indigenous people and settlement of indigenous lands by a massive amount of vietnamese settlers led to massive protests and demonstrations by the central highlands indigenous ethnic minorities against the vietnamese in january–february 2001 and this event gave a tremendous blow to the claim often published by the vietnamese government that in vietnam there has been no ethnic confrontation no religious war no ethnic conflict and no elimination of one culture by another


 health issues 
in december 1993 the united nations general assembly proclaimed the international decade of the worlds indigenous people and requested un specialized agencies to consider with governments and indigenous people how they can contribute to the success of the decade of indigenous people commencing in december 1994 as a consequence the world health organization at its forty-seventh world health assembly established a core advisory group of indigenous representatives with special knowledge of the health needs and resources of their communities thus beginning a long-term commitment to the issue of the health of indigenous peoplesthe who notes that statistical data on the health status of indigenous peoples is scarce this is especially notable for indigenous peoples in africa asia and eastern europe but snapshots from various countries where such statistics are available show that indigenous people are in worse health than the general population in advanced and developing countries alike higher incidence of diabetes in some regions of australia higher prevalence of poor sanitation and lack of safe water among twa households in rwanda a greater prevalence of childbirths without prenatal care among ethnic minorities in vietnam suicide rates among inuit youth in canada are eleven times higher than the national average infant mortality rates are higher for indigenous peoples everywhere


 racism and discrimination 

indigenous peoples have frequently been subjected to various forms of racism and discrimination indigenous peoples have been denoted primitives savages or uncivilized these terms were common during the heights of european colonial expansion but still continue in certain societies in modern times during the 17th century indigenous peoples were commonly labeled uncivilized some philosophers such as thomas hobbes considered indigenous people to be merely savages while others are purported to have considered them to be noble savages those who were close to the hobbesian view tended to believe themselves to have a duty to civilize and modernize the indigenous although anthropologists especially from europe used to apply these terms to all tribal cultures it has fallen into disfavor as demeaning and is according to many anthropologists not only inaccurate but dangerous
survival international runs a campaign to stamp out media portrayal of indigenous peoples as primitive or savages friends of peoples close to nature considers not only that indigenous culture should be respected as not being inferior but also sees their way of life as a lesson of sustainability and a part of the struggle within the corrupted western world from which the threat stemsafter world war i however many europeans came to doubt the morality of the means used to civilize peoples at the same time the anti-colonial movement and advocates of indigenous peoples argued that words such as civilized and savage were products and tools of colonialism and argued that colonialism itself was savagely destructive in the mid 20th century european attitudes began to shift to the view that indigenous and tribal peoples should have the right to decide for themselves what should happen to their ancient cultures and ancestral lands
