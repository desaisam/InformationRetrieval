below is a list of sovereign states with the dates of their formation date of their independence or of their constitution sorted by continent 
this list includes the 195 states which are currently full member states or observer states of the united nations this does not include list of former sovereign states but does include several states with limited recognition
for proposed states or various indigenous nations which consider themselves still under occupation see list of active autonomist and secessionist movements 
micronations are not included in this list
nation-building is a long evolutionary process and in most cases the date of a countrys formation cannot be objectively determined eg the fact that england and france were sovereign kingdoms on equal footing in the medieval period
does not prejudice the fact that england is not now a sovereign state having passed sovereignty to the uk in 1707 while france is a republic founded in 1792  technically france currently refers to the french fifth republic formed in 1958
an unambiguous measure is the date of national constitutions but as constitutions are an entirely modern concept all formation dates by that criterion are modern or early modern the oldest constitution being that of san marino dating to 1600
independence dates for widely recognised states earlier than 1919 should be treated with caution since prior to the founding of the league of nations there was no international body to recognise nationhood and independence had no meaning beyond mutual recognition of de facto sovereigns the role of the league of nations was effectively taken over by the united nations after the second world war see also disputed territories
many countries have some remote or fantastically remote symbolic foundation date as part of their national mythology sometimes artificially inflating a countrys age for reasons of nationalism sometimes merely gesturing at a long and gradual process of the formation of an ethnic identity such dates reflect not the formation of a state an independent political entity but of a nation an ethnic or cultural grouping terms that are often conflated in the context of nation states
the following list contains the formation dates of countries with a short description of those events for a more detailed description of a countrys formation and history please see the main article for each country

in this list date of last subordination refers to the last date of control by an external government the list shows large groupings associated with the dates of independence from decolonization eg 41 current states gained control of sovereignty from united kingdom and france between 1956 and 1966 or dissolution of a political union eg 18 current states gained control of sovereignty from soviet union and yugoslavia between 1990 and 1992 in other cases a sovereign state submitted to foreign military occupation or political subjugation for a period of time and later regained its independence eg 6 current states gained control of sovereignty from nazi germany between 1944 and 1945
dates refer to de facto rule or occupation of the major territory whether or not legitimized by international recognition
in a union such as czechoslovakia the soviet union or the kalmar union one of the constituents can be considered the dominant power â€“ generally where the seat of government was located  the united kingdom is a particularly complicated case if england is viewed as the dominant member then history can be traced from roman conquest saxon invasions 10th century unification and the 1066 norman conquest before the union of england and scotland in 1707 however if viewed from a scottish perspective an unbroken history of sovereignty can be traced from unification in 843 through the 1707 union with england with a brief annexation by england from 1657 to 1660  some scots view the 1707 union as a ceding of sovereignty to england
