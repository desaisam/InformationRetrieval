this is a list of periodic comets that were numbered by the minor planet center after having been observed on at least two occasions as of  october 2018 there are 375 numbered comets 1p–375p most of them being members of the jupiter-family jfc there are also 27 encke-type comets etcs 14 halley-type comets htcs 4 chiron-type comets ctcs and one long-period comet ie 153p many of these bodies are also near-earth comets necs in addition 8 numbered comets are principally classified as minor planets – five main-belt comets two centaurs cen and one apollo asteroid – and display characteristics of both an asteroid and a comet
occasionally comets will break up into multiple chunks as volatiles coming off the comet may cause it to break into two or more pieces an extreme example of this is 73pschwassmann–wachmann which broke into over 50 pieces during its 1995 perihelion
