national institute of aeronautics and space indonesian lembaga penerbangan dan antariksa nasionallapan is the indonesian government space agency  it was established on november 27 1963 by former indonesian president sukarno after one years existence of an informal space agency organization lapan is responsible for long-term civilian and military aerospace research for over two decades it has managed satellites and domain-developed small scientific-technology satellites lapan and telecommunication satellites palapa which were built by hughes now boeing satellite systems and launched from the us on delta rockets or from french guiana using ariane 4 and ariane 5 rockets it has also developed sounding rockets and has been trying to develop small orbital space launchers the  lapan a1 in 2007 and lapan a2 satellites were launched by india in 2015


 history 
on may 31 1962 indonesia commenced aeronautics exploration when the aeronautics committee was established by the indonesian prime minister juanda who was also the head of indonesian aeronautics  the secretary of indonesian aeronautics rj salatun was also involved in the establishmenton september 22 1962 the initial scientific and military rocket project known in indonesia as proyek roket ilmiah dan militer awal or prima was formed as an affiliation of auri indonesian air force and itb bandung institute of technology  the outcome of the project was the launching of two kartikastar series rockets and their telemetric ordnances
after two informal projects which had no national contribution the national institute of aeronautics and space lapan was established in 1963 by presidential decree 236


 programmes 
for more than 20 years lapan has done research on rocket remote sensing satellites and space sciences


 satellites 


 palapa a1 and a2 
the first program was the palapa a1 launched august 7 1976 and a2 launched october 3 1977 the satellites were almost identical to canadas anik and western unions westars although the satellites belonged to the government-owned company perumtel the spacecraft were made in the united states


 lapan satellites 
the development of microsatellites has become an opportunity for lapan in developing its space program the development of such satellites requires only limited budget and facilities compared to the development of big satellites meanwhile the capability to develop micro-satellite will brings lapan to the readiness state to implement a future space program that will have measurable economic impact and therefore contribute to the country’s sustainable development effort


 lapan-a1 
lapan-a1 or lapan-tubsat is designed to transfer of knowledge skill and experience on micro-satellite technology development from technische universität berlin germany to lapan the spacecraft is based the german dlr-tubsat but includes a new star sensor and features a new 45 × 45 × 27 cm structure the satellite payload is a cots video camera with 1000 mm lens resulting in nadir resolution of 5 m and nadir swath of 3.5 km from 650 km altitude in addition to that the satellite carries another video camera with 50 mm lens resulting in 200 m resolution video image with swath of 80 km at nadir the uplink and downlink for telemetry tracking and command ttc is done in uhf and downlink for video is done in s-band analog the satellite was successfully launched to sso of 635 km as auxiliary payload in polar satellite launch vehicle pslv c7 from sriharikota india on january 10 2007 lapan tubsat performed technological experiments earth observation and attitude control experiments


 lapan-a2 
the mission for lapan-a2 or lapan-orari is earth observation using rgb camera maritime traffic monitoring using an automatic identification system ais which can know about name and flag of the ship registered ship type physical and tonnage of the ship correct and current route departure and arrival port and amateur radio communication text and voice orari is indonesian amateur radio organization the satellite will be launched as a secondary payload of indias astrosat mission into a circular orbit of 650 km with an inclination of 8 degrees the purpose of the project is to develop capability to design assembly integration and test ait process of a micro-satellite in indonesia the satellite was successfully launched on 28 september 2015 using indias isro polar satellite launch vehicle pslv and will monitor indonesia every 97 minutes or 14 times a day


 lapan-a3 
lapan-a3 or lapan-ipb will perform experimental remote sensing mission in addition to that the satellite will support global ais mission and amateur radio communication the satellite payload is a four-band push broom multi-spectral imaging camera landsat band b g r nir which will give resolution of 18 m and coverage of 120 km from 650 km altitude the satellite has been launched in june 2016


 international cooperation 
in 2008 indonesia signed an agreement with the ukrainian national space agency nsau that will allow access to rocket and satellite technologies


 spaceport development plan 


 biak spaceport plan 2006 
since 2006 indonesia and russia have been discussing the possibility of launching a satellite from biak island using air launch technology lapan and russian federal space agency rka have worked on a government-to-government agreement in space cooperation in order to enable such activities in indonesia it is planned that antonov an-124 aircraft will deliver a polyot space launch vehicle to the new indonesian spaceport on biak island west papua province this spaceport is well suited to commercial launches as it sits almost exactly on the equator - any space vehicle launched at the equator has a greater initial velocity imparted to it making higher velocity or heavier payloads possible in the spaceport the launch vehicle will be fuelled and the satellites will be loaded on it the antonov an-124 carrying the launch vehicle is to fly at 10 km altitude above the ocean east of biak island to jettison the launch vehicle  in 2012 discussions resumed the main stumbling block is russian concerns over compliance with the terms of the missile technology control regime russia is a co-signatory indonesia is not


 enggano launchpad plan 2011 
in 2011 lapan planned to build a satellite launchpad at enggano island bengkulu province located at the westernmost part of indonesia at the indian ocean coast there are three possible locations two in kioyo natural park and one in gunung nanua bird park the most strategic site for this launchpad is inside nanua bird park a place called tanjung laboko which is 20 meters above sea level and far from residential areas the satellite launch pad requires area only one hectare but the safety zone requires 200 hectares the cost to be disbursed is rp40 trillion around 4.5 billion the location is also available for assembly of the rockets and launch preparations for satellites of up to 3.8 tonnes
the plan has concerned from the bengkulu natural resources conservation agency because both parks are habitat for a number of bird species native to enggano island which ended by rejetion by bengkulu province government


 morotai spaceport plan 2012 
after studying the surrounding environment in three potential spaceport island sites enggano-bengkulu morotai-north maluku and biak-papua lapan 21/11 announced morotai island as a future spaceport site planning started in december 2012 the launch sites completion is expected in 2025 in 2013 lapan planned to launch an rx-550 experimental satellite launcher from a location in morotai to be decided this island was selected according to the following criteria

morotai islands location near the equator which makes the launch more economical
the island has seven runways one of them 2,400 meters easily extended to 3,000 meters
the ease of building on morotai which is not densely populated and little potential for social conflict with native inhabitants
morotai islands east side faces the pacific ocean directly reducing downrange risks to other island populations
