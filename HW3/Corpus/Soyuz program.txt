the soyuz programme  soy-yooz  saw- russian союз sɐˈjus meaning union is a human spaceflight programme that was initiated by the soviet union in the early 1960s originally part of a moon landing project intended to put a soviet cosmonaut on the moon it was the third soviet human spaceflight programme after the vostok and voskhod programme
the programme consists of the soyuz spacecraft and the soyuz rocket and is now the responsibility of the russian roscosmos since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011 all human spaceflights to and from the international space station have been carried out using soyuz


 soyuz rocket 

the launch vehicles used in the soyuz expendable launch system are manufactured at the progress state research and production rocket space center tsskb-progress in samara russia as well as being used in the soyuz programme as the launcher for the manned soyuz spacecraft soyuz launch vehicles are now also used to launch unmanned progress supply spacecraft to the international space station and commercial launches marketed and operated by tsskb-progress and the starsem company currently soyuz vehicles are launched from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan and the plesetsk cosmodrome in northwest russia and since 2011 soyuz launch vehicles are also being launched from the guiana space centre in french guiana the spaceport’s new soyuz launch site has been handling soyuz launches since 21 october 2011 the date of the first launch
as of july 2014 8 soyuz launches had been made from french guiana all successful


 soyuz spacecraft 

the basic soyuz spacecraft design was the basis for many projects many of which never came to light its earliest form was intended to travel to the moon without employing a huge booster like the saturn v or the soviet n-1 by repeatedly docking with upper stages that had been put in orbit using the same rocket as the soyuz this and the initial civilian designs were done under the soviet chief designer sergei pavlovich korolev who did not live to see the craft take flight several military derivatives took precedence in the soviet design process though they never came to pass
a soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts from front to back

a spheroid orbital module
a small aerodynamic reentry module
a cylindrical service module with solar panels attachedthere have been many variants of the soyuz spacecraft including

 derivatives 
the zond spacecraft was another derivative designed to take a crew traveling in a figure-eight orbit around the earth and the moon but never achieving the degree of safety or political need to be used for such
finally the progress series of unmanned cargo ships for the salyut and mir space laboratories used the automatic navigation and docking mechanism but not the re-entry capsule of soyuz
while not a direct derivative the chinese shenzhou spacecraft follows the basic template originally pioneered by soyuz
