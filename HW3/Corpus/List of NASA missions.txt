this is a list of nasa missions both crewed and robotic since its establishment  1958


 current missions 
there are over 70 currently active missions


 x-plane program 

since 1945 naca nasas predecessor and since 1958 nasa have conducted the x-plane program  the program was originally intended to create a family of experimental aircraft not intended for production beyond the limited number of each design built solely for flight research the first x-plane the bell x-1 was the first rocket-powered airplane to break the sound barrier on october 14 1947 x-planes have set numerous milestones since then both manned and unmanned


 crewed missions 


 human spaceflight 

nasa has successfully launched over 200 manned flights two have ended in failure causing the death of the entire crew sts-51-l the challenger disaster in 1986 and sts-107 the columbia disaster in 2003 apollo 1 in 1967 lost three crew members but never launched

notes


 future 
on may 7 the obama administration announced the launch of an independent review of planned us human space flight activities with the goal of ensuring that the nation is on a vigorous and sustainable path to achieving its boldest aspirations in space the review was conducted by a panel of experts led by norman augustine the former ceo of lockheed martin who served on the presidents council of advisers on science and technology under both democrat and republican presidents
the review of united states human space flight plans was to examine ongoing and planned national aeronautics and space administration nasa development activities as well as potential alternatives and present options for advancing a safe innovative affordable and sustainable human space flight program in the years following space shuttle retirement the panel worked closely with nasa and sought input from the united states congress the white house the public industry and international partners as it developed its options it presented its results on october 22 2009in february 2010 obama announced his proposal to cancel the constellation program as part of the 2011 economic projects constellation was officially cancelled by the nasa budget authorization act on 11 october 2010
nasa brought the orion mpcv back to life from the defunct constellation program and successfully test launched the first capsule on december 5 2014 aboard eft-1  after a near perfect flight traveling 3600 miles above earth the spacecraft was recovered for study  nasa plans to use the orion crew vehicle to send humans to deep space locations such as the moon near earth asteroids and mars starting in the 2020s  orion will be powered by nasas new heavy lift vehicle the space launch system sls which is currently under development  orions next flight along with the first sls flight is slated to launch in december 2019 with the designation of exploration mission 1  this mission will send an uncrewed orion capsule around the moon  it will be succeeded by exploration mission 2 sending a crewed orion spacecraft to an undetermined location in the early 2020s
