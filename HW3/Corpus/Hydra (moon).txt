hydra is a natural satellite of pluto with a diameter of approximately 51 km 32 mi across its longest dimension hydra is the second largest moon of pluto being slightly larger than nix hydra was discovered along with nix by the pluto companion search team in june 2005 it was named after the hydra the nine-headed underworld serpent in greek mythology by distance hydra is the fifth and outermost moon of pluto orbiting beyond plutos fourth moon kerberoshydra has a highly reflective surface caused by the presence of water ice hydras reflectivity is intermediate between those of pluto and charon the new horizons spacecraft imaged pluto and its moons on july 2015 and had returned multiple images of hydra


 discovery 

hydra was discovered by researchers of the pluto companion search team consisting of hal a weaver and many others involved in the new horizons mission to pluto including alan stern and marc w buie the new horizons team had suspected that pluto might be accompanied with other moons hence they used the hubble space telescope to observe faint moons around pluto since hydras brightness is about 5,000 times fainter than pluto long exposure images of pluto were taken in order to find hydrathe discovery images were taken on 15 may 2005 and 18 may 2005 hydra and nix were independently discovered by max j mutchler on 15 june 2005 and by andrew j steffl on 15 august 2005 the discoveries were announced on 31 october 2005 after confirmation by precovering archival hubble images of pluto from 2002 the two newly discovered moons were subsequently provisionally designated s2005 p 1 for hydra and s2005 p 2 for nix the moons were informally referred to as p1 and p2 respectively by the discovery team


 naming 

the name hydra was approved on 21 june 2006 by the international astronomical union iau and was announced along with the naming of nix in the iau circular 8723 hydra was named after the lernaean hydra a nine-headed serpent that battled heracles in greek mythology particularly the nine heads of hydra subtly references plutos former ninth planetary status the two newly named moons were intentionally named that the order of their initials n and h honors the new horizons mission to pluto similarly to how the first two letters of plutos name honors percival lowell hydras name was also intentionally chosen that its initial h honors the hubble space telescope used by the pluto companion search team to discover nix and hydrathe names of features on the bodies in the pluto system are related to mythology and the literature and history of exploration in particular the names of features on hydra must be related to legendary serpents and dragons from literature mythology and history


 origin 
plutos smaller moons including hydra were thought to have formed from debris ejected from a massive collision between pluto and another kuiper belt object similarly to how the moon was thought to have formed from debris ejected by a large collision of earth the ejecta from the collision would then coalesce into the moons of pluto it was thought that hydra had initially formed at a closer proximity to pluto and its orbit had undergone tidal evolution in this case hydra along with the smaller moons of pluto had migrated outwards with charon into their current orbits around the pluto-charon barycenter through tidal damping by mutual tidal interactions with charon hydras orbit around the pluto-charon barycenter gradually became more circular over time hydra was thought to have formed from two smaller objects merging into one single object


 characteristics 


 physical characteristics 

hydra is irregular in shape measuring 50.9 km 31.6 mi along its longest axis and its shortest axis 30.9 km 19.2 mi across this gives hydra the measured dimensions of 50.9 km × 36.1 km × 30.9 km 31.6 mi × 22.4 mi × 19.2 mithe surface of hydra is highly reflective due to the presence of water ice on its surface the surface of hydra displays a neutral spectrum similarly to plutos small moons although the spectrum of hydra appears slightly bluer the water ice on hydras surface is relatively pure and shows no significant darkening compared to charon one explanation suggests that hydras surface is continually refreshed by micrometeorite impacts ejecting darker material from the surface of hydrathe surface spectrum of hydra is slightly bluish compared to the neutral surface spectrum of nix explanations for hydras bluish color suggest that the surface of hydra has a higher amount of water ice compared to nix which could also explain hydras very high geometric albedo or its reflectivity of 83 percentderived from crater counting data from new horizons the surface of hydra is estimated to be about four billion years old large craters and indentations on hydra suggest that it may have lost some of its original mass from impact events since its formation


 rotation 

hydra is not tidally locked and rotates chaotically its rotational period and axial tilt vary quickly over astronomical timescales to the point that its rotational axis regularly flips over hydras chaotic tumbling is largely caused by the varying gravitational influences of pluto and charon as they orbit around their barycenter hydras chaotic tumbling is also strengthened by its irregular shape which creates torques that act on the object at the time of the new horizons flyby of pluto and its moons hydras rotation period was approximately 10 hours and its rotational axis was tilted about 110 degrees to its orbit — it was rotating sideways at the time of the new horizons flybyhydra rotates relatively quickly compared to the rest of plutos moons which all have rotation periods greater than one day this rapid rotation of hydra is common among the rotation periods of most kuiper belt objects hydras surface material could get ejected due to centrifugal forces if it were rotating at a faster rate


 orbit 

hydra orbits the pluto-charon barycenter at a distance of 64,738 km 40,226 mi hydra is the outermost moon of pluto orbiting beyond kerberos similarly to all of plutos moons hydras orbit is nearly circular and is coplanar to charons orbit all of plutos moons have very low orbital inclinations to plutos equator
the nearly circular and coplanar orbits of plutos moons suggest that they may have gone through tidal evolutions since their formation at the time of the formation of plutos smaller moons hydra may have had a more eccentric orbit around the pluto-charon barycenter the present circular orbit of hydra may have been caused by charons tidal damping of the eccentricity of hydras orbit through tidal interactions the mutual tidal interactions of charon on hydras orbit would cause hydra to transfer its orbital eccentricity to charon thus causing the orbit of hydra to gradually become more circular over timehydra has an orbital period of approximately 38.2 days and is resonant with other moons of pluto hydra is in a 23 orbital resonance with nix and a 611 resonance with styx the ratios represent numbers of orbits completed per unit time the period ratios are the inverses as a result of this laplace-like 3-body resonance it has conjunctions with styx and nix in a 53 ratio
hydras orbit is close to a 16 orbital resonance with charon with a timing discrepancy of 0.3 a hypothesis explaining the near-resonance suggests that the resonance originated before the outward migration of charon after the formation of all five known moons and is maintained by the periodic local fluctuation of 5% in the pluto–charon gravitational field strength


 exploration 

the new horizons spacecraft visited the pluto system and imaged pluto and its moons during its flyby on 14 july 2015 at the time of the new horizons flyby hydra was behind pluto and was further away from new horizons at closest approach the larger distance of hydra from new horizons resulted in lower resolution images of hydra  before the flyby the long range reconnaissance imager on board new horizons performed measurements of hydras size estimating hydra to be about 45 km 28 mi in diameter hydras surface composition reflectivity and other basic physical properties were later performed by new horizons during the flyby
the first detailed image of hydra was downlinked or received from the new horizons spacecraft on 15 july 2015 after the flyby the first detailed image of hydra taken from a distance of 640,000 km 400,000 mi appeared to show brightness variations and a dark circular feature 10 km 6.2 mi across the highest resolution images of hydra were taken from a distance of 231,000 km 144,000 mi with an image resolution of 1.2 km 0.75 mi per pixel derived from those images hydra was given the approximate size estimate of 55 km × 40 km 34 mi × 25 mi
