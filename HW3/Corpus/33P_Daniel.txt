comet daniel is a periodic comet in the solar system discovered by zaccheus daniel halsted observatory princeton university new jersey united states on december 7 1909 estimated as magnitude 9
following its discovery the returns for 1916 1923 and 1930 were predicted but on each occasion it was not recovered
the 1937 return was recovered by shin-ichi shimizu simada japan on january 31 after a calculation of the comets orbit by hidewo hirose tokyo japan after he took calculations for the 1923 return done by alexander d dubiago and took into account perturbations from jupiter
all returns apart from 1957 and 1971 have been recovered
repeated close encounters with jupiter have increased this comets orbital period steadily since it was first discovered it will likely increase again to 8.29 years when it next encounters jupiter on december 2 2018
the comet nucleus is estimated to be 2.6 kilometers in diameterat some point between 2009 january 11 and 30 the comet underwent an outburst of around 3 magnitudes brightening from 18th to 15th magnitude
