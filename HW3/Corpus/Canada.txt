 etymology 

while a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of canada the name is now accepted as coming from the st lawrence iroquoian word kanata meaning village or settlement in 1535 indigenous inhabitants of the present-day quebec city region used the word to direct french explorer jacques cartier to the village of stadacona cartier later used the word canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to donnacona the chief at stadacona by 1545 european books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the saint lawrence river as canadafrom the 16th to the early 18th century canada referred to the part of new france that lay along the saint lawrence river in 1791 the area became two british colonies called upper canada and lower canada collectively named the canadas until their union as the british province of canada in 1841 upon confederation in 1867 canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the london conference and the word dominion was conferred as the countrys title the gradual decrease in use of dominion was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage of the canada act which refers only to canada and later that year the name of the national holiday was changed from dominion day to canada day the term dominion is also used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces though after the second world war the term federal had replaced dominion


 history 


 indigenous peoples 

indigenous peoples in present-day canada include the first nations inuit and métis the last being a mixed-blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when first nations and inuit people married european settlers the term aboriginal as a collective noun is a specific term of art used in some legal documents including the constitution act 1982the first inhabitants of north america are generally hypothesized to have migrated from siberia by way of the bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago the paleo-indian archeological sites at old crow flats and bluefish caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in canada the characteristics of canadian indigenous societies included permanent settlements agriculture complex societal hierarchies and trading networks some of these cultures had collapsed by the time european explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigationsthe indigenous population at the time of the first european settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million with a figure of 500,000 accepted by canadas royal commission on aboriginal peoples as a consequence of european colonization the population of canadas indigenous peoples declined by forty to eighty percent and several first nations such as the beothuk disappeared the decline is attributed to several causes including the transfer of european diseases such as influenza measles and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity conflicts over the fur trade conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers and the loss of indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations self-sufficiencyalthough not without conflict european canadians early interactions with first nations and inuit populations were relatively peaceful first nations and métis peoples played a critical part in the development of european colonies in canada particularly for their role in assisting european coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the north american fur trade the crown and indigenous peoples began interactions during the european colonization period though the inuit in general had more limited interaction with european settlers however from the late 18th century european canadians encouraged indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture these attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations a period of redress is underway which started with the appointment of the truth and reconciliation commission of canada by the government of canada in 2008


 european colonization 
in about 1000 ad the norse built a small encampment that only lasted a few years at lanse aux meadows on the northern tip of newfoundland no further european exploration occurred until 1497 when italian seafarer john cabot explored and claimed canadas atlantic coast in the name of king henry vii of england then basque and portuguese mariners established seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the atlantic coast in the early 16th century in 1534 french explorer jacques cartier explored the gulf of saint lawrence where on july 24 he planted a 10-metre 33 ft cross bearing the words long live the king of france and took possession of the territory new france in the name of king francis i in general the settlements appear to have been short-lived possibly due to the similarity of outputs producible in scandinavia and northern canada and the problems of navigating trade routes at that timein 1583 sir humphrey gilbert by the royal prerogative of queen elizabeth i founded st johns newfoundland as the first north american english colony french explorer samuel de champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent european settlements at port royal in 1605 and quebec city in 1608 among the colonists of new france canadiens extensively settled the saint lawrence river valley and acadians settled the present-day maritimes while fur traders and catholic missionaries explored the great lakes hudson bay and the mississippi watershed to louisiana the beaver wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the north american fur trade

the english established additional settlements in newfoundland beginning in 1610 and the thirteen colonies to the south were founded soon after a series of four wars erupted in colonial north america between 1689 and 1763 the later wars of the period constituted the north american theatre of the seven years war mainland nova scotia came under british rule with the 1713 treaty of utrecht and canada and most of new france came under british rule in 1763 after the seven years warthe royal proclamation of 1763 established first nation treaty rights created the province of quebec out of new france and annexed cape breton island to nova scotia st johns island now prince edward island became a separate colony in 1769 to avert conflict in quebec the british parliament passed the quebec act of 1774 expanding quebecs territory to the great lakes and ohio valley more importantly the quebec act afforded quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time the thirteen colonies were increasingly agitating against british rule it re-established the french language catholic faith and french civil law there staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the thirteen colonies the proclamation and the quebec act in turn angered many residents of the thirteen colonies further fuelling anti-british sentiment in the years prior to the american revolutionafter the successful american war of independence the 1783 treaty of paris recognized the independence of the newly formed united states and set the terms of peace ceding british north american territories south of the great lakes to the new country the american war of independence also caused a large out-migration of loyalists the settlers who had fought against american independence many moved to canada particularly atlantic canada where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories new brunswick was in turn split from nova scotia as part of a reorganization of loyalist settlements in the maritimes which led to the incorporation of saint john new brunswick to become canadas first city to accommodate the influx of english-speaking loyalists in central canada the constitutional act of 1791 divided the province of canada into french-speaking lower canada later quebec and english-speaking upper canada later ontario granting each its own elected legislative assemblythe canadas were the main front in the war of 1812 between the united states and the united kingdom peace came in 1815 no boundaries were changed immigration resumed at a higher level with over 960,000 arrivals from britain between 1815 and 1850 new arrivals included refugees escaping the great irish famine as well as gaelic-speaking scots displaced by the highland clearances infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of europeans who immigrated to canada before 1891the desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive rebellions of 1837 the durham report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of french canadians into english culture the act of union merged the canadas into a united province of canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of british north america by 1849 the signing of the oregon treaty by britain and the united states in 1846 ended the oregon boundary dispute extending the border westward along the 49th parallel this paved the way for british colonies on vancouver island 1849 and in british columbia 1858 in 1867 the same year as canadian confederation britain declined to purchase for canada the alaska territory that was tenuously held by russia with the united states purchasing alaska instead clearly demarcated borders for canada although there would continue to be some disputes about the exact demarcation of the alaska-yukon and alaska-bc border for years to come


 confederation and expansion 

following several constitutional conferences the constitution act officially proclaimed canadian confederation on july 1 1867 initially with four provinces ontario quebec nova scotia and new brunswick canada assumed control of ruperts land and the north-western territory to form the northwest territories where the métis grievances ignited the red river rebellion and the creation of the province of manitoba in july 1870 british columbia and vancouver island which had been united in 1866 joined the confederation in 1871 while prince edward island joined in 1873 between 1871 and 1896 almost one quarter of the canadian population immigrated southwards to the usto open the west to european immigration parliament also approved sponsoring the construction of three transcontinental railways including the canadian pacific railway opening the prairies to settlement with the dominion lands act and establishing the north-west mounted police to assert its authority over this territory in 1898 during the klondike gold rush in the northwest territories parliament created the yukon territory alberta and saskatchewan became provinces in 1905


 early 20th century 
because britain still maintained control of canadas foreign affairs under the constitution act 1867 its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought canada into world war i volunteers sent to the western front later became part of the canadian corps which played a substantial role in the battle of vimy ridge and other major engagements of the war out of approximately 625,000 canadians who served in world war i some 60,000 were killed and another 172,000 were wounded the conscription crisis of 1917 erupted when the unionist cabinets proposal to augment the militarys dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from french-speaking quebecers the military service act brought in compulsory military service though it coupled with disputes over french language schools outside quebec deeply alienated francophone canadians and temporarily split the liberal party in 1919 canada joined the league of nations independently of britain and the 1931 statute of westminster affirmed canadas independence

the great depression in canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn leading to hardship across the country in response to the downturn the co-operative commonwealth federation ccf in saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state as pioneered by tommy douglas in the 1940s and 1950s on the advice of prime minister william lyon mackenzie king war with germany was declared effective september 10 1939 by king george vi seven days after the united kingdom the delay underscored canadas independencethe first canadian army units arrived in britain in december 1939 in all over a million canadians served in the armed forces during world war ii and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war including the failed 1942 dieppe raid the allied invasion of italy the normandy landings the battle of normandy and the battle of the scheldt in 1944 canada provided asylum for the dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from nazi germanythe canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for canada britain china and the soviet union despite another conscription crisis in quebec in 1944 canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy


 contemporary era 

the financial crisis of the great depression had led the dominion of newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a crown colony ruled by a british governor after two bitter referendums newfoundlanders voted to join canada in 1949 as a provincecanadas post-war economic growth combined with the policies of successive liberal governments led to the emergence of a new canadian identity marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag in 1965 the implementation of official bilingualism english and french in 1969 and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971 socially democratic programs were also instituted such as medicare the canada pension plan and canada student loans though provincial governments particularly quebec and alberta opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictionsfinally another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the canada act the patriation of canadas constitution from the united kingdom concurrent with the creation of the canadian charter of rights and freedoms canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country although the queen retained her role as monarch of canada in 1999 nunavut became canadas third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal governmentat the same time quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the quiet revolution of the 1960s giving birth to a secular nationalist movement the radical front de libération du québec flq ignited the october crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970 and the sovereignist parti québécois was elected in 1976 organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980 attempts to accommodate quebec nationalism constitutionally through the meech lake accord failed in 1990 this led to the formation of the bloc québécois in quebec and the invigoration of the reform party of canada in the west a second referendum followed in 1995 in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent in 1997 the supreme court ruled unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional and the clarity act was passed by parliament outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from confederationin addition to the issues of quebec sovereignty a number of crises shook canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s these included the explosion of air india flight 182 in 1985 the largest mass murder in canadian history the école polytechnique massacre in 1989 a university shooting targeting female students and the oka crisis of 1990 the first of a number of violent confrontations between the government and indigenous groups canada also joined the gulf war in 1990 as part of a us-led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s including the unprofor mission in the former yugoslaviacanada sent troops to afghanistan in 2001 but declined to join the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 in 2011 canadian forces participated in the nato-led intervention into the libyan civil war and also became involved in battling the islamic state insurgency in iraq in the mid-2010s
