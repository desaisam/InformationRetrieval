25143 itokawa  japanese イトカワいとかわ糸川 itokaɰa provisional designation 1998 sf36 is a sub-kilometer near-earth object of the apollo group and a potentially hazardous asteroid it was discovered by the linear program in 1998 and later named after japanese rocket engineer hideo itokawa the strange peanut-shaped s-type asteroid has a rotation period of 12.1 hours and measures approximately 330 meters 1,100 feet in diameter due to its low density and high porosity itokawa is considered to be a  rubble pile consisting of numerous boulders of different sizes rather than of a single solid body
it was the first asteroid to be the target of a sample return mission the japanese hayabusa space probe which collected more than 1500 regolith dust particles from the asteroids surface in 2005 after its return to earth in 2010 the mineralogy petrography chemistry and isotope ratios of these particles have been studied in detail providing insights into the evolution of the solar system itokawa is the smallest asteroid ever photographed and visited by a spacecraft


 discovery and naming 
itokawa was discovered on 26 september 1998 by astronomers with the lincoln near-earth asteroid research linear program at lincoln laboratorys experimental test site near socorro new mexico in the united states it was given the provisional designation 1998 sf36 the bodys observation arc begins with its first observation by the sloan digital sky survey just one week prior to its official discovery observation the minor planet was named in memory of japanese rocket scientist hideo itokawa 1912–1999 who is regarded as the father of japanese rocketry the official naming citation was published by the minor planet center on 6 august 2003 mpc 49281


 orbit and classification 
itokawa belongs to the apollo asteroids they are earth-crossing asteroids and the largest dynamical group of near-earth objects with nearly 10 thousand known members itokawa orbits the sun at a distance of 0.95–1.70 au once every 18 months 557 days semi-major axis of 1.32 au its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.28 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic it has a low earth minimum orbital intersection distance of 0.0131 au 1,960,000 km which corresponds to 5.1 lunar distances


 hayabusa exploration 

in 2000 it was selected as the target of japans hayabusa mission the probe arrived in the vicinity of itokawa on 12 september 2005 and initially parked in an asteroid–sun line at 20 km 12 mi and later 7 km 4.3 mi from the asteroid itokawas gravity was too weak to provide an orbit so the spacecraft adjusted its orbit around the sun until it matched the asteroids hayabusa landed on 20 november for thirty minutes but it failed to operate a device designed to collect soil samples on 25 november a second landing and sampling sequence was attempted the sample capsule was returned to earth and landed at woomera south australia on 13 june 2010 around 1351 utc 2321 local on 16 november 2010 the japan aerospace exploration agency reported that dust collected during hayabusas voyage was indeed from the asteroid


 surface features 
names of major surface features were proposed by hayabusa scientists and accepted by the working group for planetary system nomenclature of the international astronomical union also the hayabusa science team is using working names for smaller surface features the following tables list the names of geological features on the asteroid no naming conventions have been disclosed for surface features on itokawa


 craters 
ten impact craters on the surface of itokawa were named on 18 february 2009


 regiones 
regio or regiones are large area marked by reflectivity or color distinctions from adjacent areas in planetary geology the following regiones have been named on itokawa


 physical characteristics 

itokawa is a stony s-type asteroid radar imaging by goldstone in 2001 observed an ellipsoid 630±60 meters long and 250±30 meters widethe hayabusa mission confirmed these findings and also suggested that itokawa may be a contact binary formed by two or more smaller asteroids that have gravitated toward each other and stuck together the hayabusa images show a surprising lack of impact craters and a very rough surface studded with boulders described by the mission team as a rubble pile furthermore the density of the asteroid is too low for it to be made from solid rock this would mean that itokawa is not a monolith but rather a rubble pile formed from fragments that have cohered over time based on yarkovsky–okeefe–radzievskii–paddack effect measurements a small section of itokawa is estimated to have a density of 2.9 gcm3 whereas a larger section is estimated to have a density of 1.8 gcm³


 rotation period and poles 
since 2001 a large number of rotational lightcurves of itokawa have been obtained from photometric observations analysis of the best-rated lightcurve by mikko kaasalainen gave a sidereal rotation period of 12.132 hours with a high brightness variation of 0.8 magnitude indicative of the asteroids non-spherical shape u3 in addition kaasalainen also determined two spin axes of 355.0° −84.0° and 39° −87.0° in ecliptic coordinates λ β alternative lightcurve measurements were made by lambert 12 h lowry 12.1 and 12.12 h ohba 12.15 h warner 12.09 h ďurech 12.1323 h and nishihara 12.1324 h


 composition 
the 26 august 2011 issue of science devoted six articles to findings based on dust that hayabusa had collected from itokawa scientists analysis suggested that itokawa was probably made up from interior fragments of a larger asteroid that broke apart dust collected from the asteroid surface is thought to have been exposed there for about eight million yearsscientists used varied techniques of chemistry and mineralogy to analyze the dust from itokawa itokawas composition was found to match the common type of meteorites known as low-total-iron low metal ordinary chondrites another team of scientists determined that the dark iron color on the surface of itokawa was the result of abrasion by micrometeoroids and high-speed particles from the sun which had converted the normally whitish iron oxide coloring


 2018 hayabusa results 
two separate groups report water in different itokawa particles jin et al report water in low-calcium pyroxene grains the waters isotope level corresponds with inner solar system and carbonaceous chondrite water isotope levels daly et al report oh and  h2o apparently formed by implantation of solar wind hydrogen the rims of an olivine particle show an enrichment of up to 1.2 at  in oh and h20 the water concentrations of the itokawa grains would indicate an estimated bsi bulk silicate itokawa water content in line with earths bulk water and that itokawa had been a water-rich asteroid
