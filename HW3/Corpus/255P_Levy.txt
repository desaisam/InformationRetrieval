255plevy formerly p2006 t1 and p2011 y1 is a periodic comet with an orbital period of 5.25 years it last came to perihelion closest approach to the sun on 14 january 2012 during the 2006 passage the comet achieved an apparent magnitude of 9.5 levy pk06t010 was believed to have been recovered on 3 june 2011 at magnitude 19.8 but other observatories were unable to confirm a recovery it was most likely a false positive because of large residuals levy was recovered on 17 december 2011 at magnitude 19.8 and given the second designation 2011 y1 it was then numbered
it came to perihelion on 14 january 2012 at a distance of 1.007 au from the sun  the comet passed the earth on 2012-jan-26 at a distance of 0.2359 au 35,290,000 km 21,930,000 mi  during the 2012 passage the comet was originally expected to reach an apparent magnitude of 7 but the comet had been in outburst in 2006 and was much dimmer than expected when it was recovered in 2011 mpc estimates after the 2011 recovery estimated that it would reach a magnitude of 17 and it had an elongation of 90° however ccd images showed it was diffuse and the comets magnitude was estimated at 14.1 on 30 december 2011the comet was not observed during the 2017 perihelion passage at opposition in august 2016 it would have been dimmer than magnitude 19
255plevy currently has an earth-moid of 0.025 au 3,700,000 km 2,300,000 mi
