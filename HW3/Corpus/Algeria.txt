 history 


 ancient history 

in the region of ain hanech saïda province early remnants 200,000 bc of hominid occupation in north africa were found neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the levalloisian and mousterian styles 43,000 bc similar to those in the levant algeria was the site of the highest state of development of middle paleolithic flake tool techniques tools of this era starting about 30,000 bc are called aterian after the archeological site of bir el ater south of tebessa
the earliest blade industries in north africa are called iberomaurusian located mainly in the oran region this industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the maghreb between 15,000 and 10,000 bc neolithic civilization animal domestication and agriculture developed in the saharan and mediterranean maghreb perhaps as early as 11,000 bc or as late as between 6000 and 2000 bc this life richly depicted in the tassili najjer paintings predominated in algeria until the classical period the mixture of peoples of north africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called berbers who are the indigenous peoples of northern africa

from their principal center of power at carthage the carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the north african coast by 600 bc a phoenician presence existed at tipasa east of cherchell hippo regius modern annaba and rusicade modern skikda these settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages
as carthaginian power grew its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture manufacturing trade and political organization supported several states trade links between carthage and the berbers in the interior grew but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others

by the early 4th century bc berbers formed the single largest element of the carthaginian army in the revolt of the mercenaries berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 bc after being unpaid following the defeat of carthage in the first punic war they succeeded in obtaining control of much of carthages north african territory and they minted coins bearing the name libyan used in greek to describe natives of north africa the carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the romans in the punic warsin 146 bc the city of carthage was destroyed as carthaginian power waned the influence of berber leaders in the hinterland grew by the 2nd century bc several large but loosely administered berber kingdoms had emerged two of them were established in numidia behind the coastal areas controlled by carthage west of numidia lay mauretania which extended across the moulouya river in modern-day morocco to the atlantic ocean the high point of berber civilization unequaled until the coming of the almohads and almoravids more than a millennium later was reached during the reign of masinissa in the 2nd century bc

after masinissas death in 148 bc the berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times masinissas line survived until 24 ad when the remaining berber territory was annexed to the roman empire 
for several centuries algeria was ruled by the romans who founded many colonies in the region like the rest of north africa algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products saint augustine was the bishop of hippo regius modern-day algeria located in the roman province of africa the germanic vandals of geiseric moved into north africa in 429 and by 435 controlled coastal numidia they did not make any significant settlement on the land as they were harassed by local tribes in fact by the time the byzantines arrived lepcis magna was abandoned and the msellata region was occupied by the indigenous laguatan who had been busy facilitating an amazigh political military and cultural revival


 middle ages 

after negligible resistance from the locals muslim arabs of the umayyad caliphate conquered algeria in the mid-7th century and a large number of the indigenous people converted to the newly founded faith of islam after the fall of the umayyad caliphate numerous local dynasties emerged including the aghlabids almohads abdalwadid zirids rustamids hammadids almoravids and the fatimids
during the middle ages north africa was home to many great scholars saints and sovereigns including judah ibn quraysh the first grammarian to suggest the afroasiatic language family the great sufi masters sidi boumediene abu madyan and sidi el houari and the emirs abd al mumin and yāghmūrasen it was during this time that the fatimids or children of fatima daughter of muhammad came to the maghreb these fatimids went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the maghreb hejaz and the levant boasting a secular inner government as well as a powerful army and navy made up primarily of arabs and levantines extending from algeria to their capital state of cairo the fatimid caliphate began to collapse when its governors the zirids seceded in order to punish them the fatimids sent the arab banu hilal and banu sulaym against them the resultant war is recounted in the epic tāghribāt in al-tāghrībāt the amazigh zirid hero khālīfā al-zānatī asks daily for duels to defeat the hilalan hero ābu zayd al-hilalī and many other arab knights in a string of victories the zirids however were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of arab customs and culture the indigenous amazigh tribes however remained largely independent and depending on tribe location and time controlled varying parts of the maghreb at times unifying it as under the fatimids the fatimid islamic state also known as fatimid caliphate made an islamic empire that included north africa sicily palestine jordan lebanon syria egypt the red sea coast of africa tihamah hejaz and yemen caliphates from northern africa traded with the other empires of their time as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other islamic states during the islamic era

the amazighs historically consisted of several tribes the two main branches were the botr and barnès tribes who were divided into tribes and again into sub-tribes each region of the maghreb contained several tribes for example sanhadja houara zenata masmouda kutama awarba and berghwata all these tribes made independent territorial decisionsseveral amazigh dynasties emerged during the middle ages in the maghreb and other nearby lands ibn khaldun provides a table summarising the amazigh dynasties of the maghreb region the zirid banu ifran maghrawa almoravid hammadid almohad merinid abdalwadid wattasid meknassa and hafsid dynastiesin the early 16th century spain constructed fortified outposts presidios on or near the algerian coast spain took control of few coastal towns like mers el kebir in 1505 oran in 1509 and tlemcen mostaganem and ténès in 1510 in the same year a few merchants of algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbour to spain which built a fort on it the presidios in north africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavour that did not guarantee access for spains merchant fleet

there reigned in ifriqiya current tunisia a berber family zirid somehow recognising the suzerainty of the fatimid caliph of cairo probably in 1048 the zirid ruler or viceroy el-muizz decided to end this suzerainty the fatimid state was too weak to attempt a punitive expedition the viceroy el-muizz also found another means of revenge
between the nile and the red sea were living bedouin tribes expelled from arabia for their disruption and turbulent influence both banu hilal and banu sulaym among others whose presence disrupted farmers in the nile valley since the nomads would often loot the then fatimid vizier devised to relinquish control of the maghreb and obtained the agreement of his sovereign this not only prompted the bedouins to leave but the fatimid treasury even gave them a light expatriation cash allowance
whole tribes set off with women children ancestors animals and camping equipment some stopped on the way especially in cyrenaica where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in ifriqiya by the gabes region the zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide but each meeting the last under the walls of kairouan his troops were defeated and arabs remained masters of the field
the flood was still rising and in 1057 the arabs spread on the high plains of constantine where they gradually choked qalaa of banu hammad as they had done kairouan few decades ago from there they gradually gained the upper algiers and oran plains some were forcibly taken by the almohads in the second half of the 12th century we can say that in the 13th century there were in all of north africa with the exception of the main mountain ranges and certain coastal regions remained entirely berber


 ottoman era 

the region of algeria was partially ruled by ottomans for three centuries from 1516 to 1830 in 1516 the turkish privateer brothers aruj and hayreddin barbarossa who operated successfully under the hafsids moved their base of operations to algiers they succeeded in conquering jijel and algiers from the spaniards but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region forcing the previous ruler abu hamo musa iii of the bani ziyad dynasty to flee when aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of tlemcen hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of algiers the ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some 2,000 janissaries with the aid of this force hayreddin conquered the whole area between constantine and oran although the city of oran remained in spanish hands until 1791

the next beylerbey was hayreddins son hasan who assumed the position in 1544 until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits subsequently with the institution of a regular ottoman administration governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms the pasha was assisted by janissaries known in algeria as the ojaq and led by an agha discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha as a result the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659plague had repeatedly struck the cities of north africa algiers lost from 30,000 to 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21 and suffered high fatalities in 1654–57 1665 1691 and 1740–42in 1671 the taifa rebelled killed the agha and placed one of its own in power the new leader received the title of dey after 1689 the right to select the dey passed to the divan a council of some sixty nobles it was at first dominated by the ojaq but by the 18th century it had become the deys instrument in 1710 the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent replacing the pasha in that role although algiers remained a part of the ottoman empirethe dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat the dey was elected for a life term but in the 159 years 1671–1830 that the system survived fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated despite usurpation military coups and occasional mob rule the day-to-day operation of ottoman government was remarkably orderly although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest autonomous tribal states were tolerated and the regencys authority was seldom applied in the kabylie

the barbary pirates preyed on christian and other non-islamic shipping in the western mediterranean sea the pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves they also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives according to robert davis from the 16th to 19th century pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million europeans as slaves they often made raids called razzias on european coastal towns to capture christian slaves to sell at slave markets in north africa and the ottoman empirein 1544 hayreddin captured the island of ischia taking 4,000 prisoners and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of lipari almost the entire population in 1551 turgut reis enslaved the entire population of the maltese island of gozo between 5,000 and 6,000 sending the captives to libya in 1554 pirates sacked vieste in southern italy and took an estimated 7,000 captives as slavesin 1558 barbary corsairs captured the town of ciutadella minorca destroyed it slaughtered the inhabitants and took 3,000 survivors as slaves to istanbul barbary pirates often attacked the balearic islands and in response the residents built many coastal watchtowers and fortified churches the threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of formentera between 1609 and 1616 england lost 466 merchant ships to barbary pirates

in july 1627 two pirate ships from algiers sailed as far as iceland raiding and capturing slaves two weeks earlier another pirate ship from salé in morocco had also raided in iceland some of the slaves brought to algiers were later ransomed back to iceland but some chose to stay in algeria in 1629 pirate ships from algeria raided the faroe islandsbarbary raids in the mediterranean continued to attack spanish merchant shipping and as a result the spanish navy bombarded algiers in 1783 and 1784 in 1792 spain abandoned oran selling it to the ottoman empire and it became the site for a new bey in algiers though french influence in the region increased over the 19th centuryin the 19th century the pirates forged affiliations with caribbean powers paying a licence tax in exchange for safe harbour of their vessels one american slave reported that the algerians had enslaved 130 american seamen in the mediterranean and atlantic from 1785 to 1793piracy on american vessels in the mediterranean resulted in the united states initiating the first 1801–1805 and second barbary wars 1815 following those wars algeria was weaker and europeans with an anglo-dutch fleet commanded by the british lord exmouth attacked algiers after a nine-hour bombardment they obtained a treaty from the dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by captain later commodore stephen decatur us navy concerning the demands of tributes in addition the dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving christiansdespite being removed from algeria in the 19th century spain retained a presence in morocco algeria consistently opposed spanish fortresses and control in nearby morocco through the 20th century


 french colonization 1830–1962 

under the pretext of a slight to their consul the french invaded and captured algiers in 1830 algerian slave trade and piracy ceased when the french conquered algiers the conquest of algeria by the french took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed a combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous algerian population to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872 historian ben kiernan wrote on the french conquest of algeria by 1875 the french conquest was complete the war had killed approximately 825,000 indigenous algerians since 1830 french losses from 1831–51 were 3,336 killed in action and 92,329 dead in the hospital the population of algeria which stood at about 2.9 million in 1872 reached nearly 11 million in 1960 french policy was predicated on civilising the country during this period a small but influential french-speaking indigenous elite was formed made up of berbers mostly kabyles
as a consequence french government favored the kabyles about 80% of indigenous schools were constructed for kabyles

from 1848 until independence france administered the whole mediterranean region of algeria as an integral part and département of the nation one of frances longest-held overseas territories algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of european immigrants who became known as colons and later as pied-noirs between 1825 and 1847 50,000 french people emigrated to algeria these settlers benefited from the french governments confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land many europeans settled in oran and algiers and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities

during the late 19th and early 20th century the european share was almost a fifth of the population the french government aimed at making algeria an assimilated part of france and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900 the indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency but in contrast to the other colonised countries path in central asia and caucasus algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human-capital intensive agriculturegradually dissatisfaction among the muslim population which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from france in may 1945 the uprising against the occupying french forces was suppressed through what is now known as the sétif and guelma massacre tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954 when the first violent events of what was later called the algerian war began historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 harkis and their dependents were killed by the front de libération nationale fln or by lynch mobs in algeria the fln used hit and run attacks in algeria and france as part of its war and the french conducted severe reprisals
the war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries historians like alistair horne and raymond aron state that the actual number of algerian muslim war dead was far greater than the original fln and official french estimates but was less than the 1 million deaths claimed by the algerian government after independence horne estimated algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around 700,000 the war uprooted more than 2 million algeriansthe war against french rule concluded in 1962 when algeria gained complete independence following the march 1962 evian agreements and the july 1962 self-determination referendum


 the first three decades of independence 1962–1991 

the number of european pied-noirs who fled algeria totaled more than 900,000 between 1962 and 1964 the exodus to mainland france accelerated after the oran massacre of 1962 in which hundreds of militants entered european sections of the city and began attacking civilians

algerias first president was the front de libération nationale fln leader ahmed ben bella moroccos claim to portions of western algeria led to the sand war in 1963 ben bella was overthrown in 1965 by houari boumédiène his former ally and defence minister under ben bella the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian boumédienne continued this trend but he relied much more on the army for his support and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role he collectivised agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive oil extraction facilities were nationalised this was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international 1973 oil crisis
in the 1960s and 1970s under president houari boumediene algeria pursued a program of industrialization within a state-controlled socialist economy boumedienes successor chadli bendjedid introduced some liberal economic reforms he promoted a policy of arabisation in algerian society and public life teachers of arabic brought in from other muslim countries spread conventional islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to orthodox islamthe algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the 1980s oil glut economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in algerian social unrest during the 1980s by the end of the decade bendjedid introduced a multi-party system political parties developed such as the islamic salvation front fis a broad coalition of muslim groups


 civil war 1991–2002 and aftermath 

in december 1991 the islamic salvation front dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections fearing the election of an islamist government the authorities intervened on 11 january 1992 cancelling the elections bendjedid resigned and a high council of state was installed to act as presidency it banned the fis triggering a civil insurgency between the fronts armed wing the armed islamic group and the national armed forces in which more than 100,000 people are thought to have died the islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacres at several points in the conflict the situation in algeria became a point of international concern most notably during the crisis surrounding air france flight 8969 a hijacking perpetrated by the armed islamic group the armed islamic group declared a ceasefire in october 1997algeria held elections in 1999 considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by president abdelaziz bouteflika he worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a civil concord initiative approved in a referendum under which many political prisoners were pardoned and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty in force until 13 january 2000 the ais disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly the groupe salafiste pour la prédication et le combat gspc a splinter group of the group islamic army continued a terrorist campaign against the governmentbouteflika was re-elected in the april 2004 presidential election after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation the programme comprised economic institutional political and social reform to modernise the country raise living standards and tackle the causes of alienation it also included a second amnesty initiative the charter for peace and national reconciliation which was approved in a referendum in september 2005 it offered amnesty to most guerrillas and government security forcesin november 2008 the algerian constitution was amended following a vote in parliament removing the two-term limit on presidential incumbents this change enabled bouteflika to stand for re-election in the 2009 presidential elections and he was re-elected in april 2009 during his election campaign and following his re-election bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a 150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs the construction of one million new housing units and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmesa continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 december 2010 inspired by similar protests across the middle east and north africa on 24 february 2011 the government lifted algerias 19-year-old state of emergency the government enacted legislation dealing with political parties the electoral code and the representation of women in elected bodies in april 2011 bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform however elections are routinely criticized by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue


 geography 

algeria is the largest country in africa and the mediterranean basin its southern part includes a significant portion of the sahara to the north the tell atlas form with the saharan atlas further south two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands both atlas tend to merge in eastern algeria the vast mountain ranges of aures and nememcha occupy the entire northeastern algeria and are delineated by the tunisian border the highest point is mount tahat 3,003 m
algeria lies mostly between latitudes 19° and 37°n a small area is north of 37°n and south of 19°n and longitudes 9°w and 12°e most of the coastal area is hilly sometimes even mountainous and there are a few natural harbours the area from the coast to the tell atlas is fertile south of the tell atlas is a steppe landscape ending with the saharan atlas farther south there is the sahara desertthe hoggar mountains arabic جبال هقار‎ also known as the hoggar are a highland region in central sahara southern algeria they are located about 1,500 km 932 mi south of the capital algiers and just east of tamanghasset algiers oran constantine and annaba are algerias main cities


 climate and hydrology 

in this region midday desert temperatures can be hot year round after sunset however the clear dry air permits rapid loss of heat and the nights are cool to chilly enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded
rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the tell atlas ranging from 400 to 670 mm 15.7 to 26.4 in annually the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east precipitation is heaviest in the northern part of eastern algeria where it reaches as much as 1,000 mm 39.4 in in some years
farther inland the rainfall is less plentiful algeria also has ergs or sand dunes between mountains among these in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty temperatures can get up to 43.3 °c 110 °f


 fauna and flora 

the varied vegetation of algeria includes coastal mountainous and grassy desert-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife many of the creatures comprising the algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilization the most commonly seen animals include the wild boars jackals and gazelles although it is not uncommon to spot fennecs foxes and jerboas algeria also has a small african leopard and saharan cheetah population but these are seldom seen a species of deer the barbary stag inhabits the dense humid forests in the north-eastern areas
a variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers the forests are inhabited by boars and jackals barbary macaques are the sole native monkey snakes monitor lizards and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of rodents throughout the semi arid regions of algeria many animals are now extinct including the barbary lions atlas bears and crocodilesin the north some of the native flora includes macchia scrub olive trees oaks cedars and other conifers the mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens aleppo pine juniper and evergreen oak and some deciduous trees fig eucalyptus agave and various palm trees grow in the warmer areas the grape vine is indigenous to the coast in the sahara region some oases have palm trees acacias with wild olives are the predominant flora in the remainder of the sahara
camels are used extensively the desert also abounds with venomous and nonvenomous snakes scorpions and numerous insects


 politics 

elected politicians have relatively little sway over algeria instead a group of unelected civilian and military décideurs known as le pouvoir the power actually rule the country even deciding who should be president the most powerful man may be mohamed mediène head of the military intelligence in recent years many of these generals have died or retired after the death of general larbi belkheir bouteflika put loyalists in key posts notably at sonatrach and secured constitutional amendments that make him re-electable indefinitelythe head of state is the president of algeria who is elected for a five-year term the president was formerly limited to two five-year terms but a constitutional amendment passed by the parliament on 11 november 2008 removed this limitation the next presidential election will be in april 2019 algeria has universal suffrage at 18 years of age the president is the head of the army the council of ministers and the high security council he appoints the prime minister who is also the head of government

 economy 

algeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the world bank algerias currency is the dinar dzd the economy remains dominated by the state a legacy of the countrys socialist post-independence development model in recent years the algerian government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy these restrictions are just starting to be lifted off recently although questions about algerias slowly-diversifying economy remain
