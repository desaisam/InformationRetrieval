 history 


 early and medieval age 

some of the earliest ancient human civilisations in south asia originated from areas encompassing present-day pakistan the earliest known inhabitants in the region were soanian during the lower paleolithic of whom stone tools have been found in the soan valley of punjab the indus region which covers most of present day pakistan was the site of several successive ancient cultures including the neolithic mehrgarh and the bronze age indus valley civilisation 2,800–1,800 bce at harappa and mohenjo-daro

the vedic period 1500–500 bce was characterised by an indo-aryan culture during this period the vedas the oldest scriptures associated with hinduism were composed and this culture later became well established in the region multan was an important hindu pilgrimage centre the vedic civilisation flourished in the ancient gandhāran city of takṣaśilā now taxila in the punjab which was founded around 1000 bce successive ancient empires and kingdoms ruled the region the persian achaemenid empire around 519 bce alexander the greats empire in 326 bce and the maurya empire founded by chandragupta maurya and extended by ashoka the great until 185 bce the indo-greek kingdom founded by demetrius of bactria 180–165 bce included gandhara and punjab and reached its greatest extent under menander 165–150 bce prospering the greco-buddhist culture in the region taxila had one of the earliest universities and centres of higher education in the world which was established during the late vedic period in 6th century bce the school consisted of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious instruction was provided on an individualistic basis the ancient university was documented by the invading forces of alexander the great the like of which had not been seen in greece and was also recorded by chinese pilgrims in the 4th or 5th century ceat its zenith the rai dynasty 489–632 ce of sindh ruled this region and the surrounding territories the pala dynasty was the last buddhist empire which under dharmapala and devapala stretched across south asia from what is now bangladesh through northern india to pakistan
the arab conqueror muhammad bin qasim conquered sindh in 711 ce the pakistan governments official chronology claims this as the time when the foundation of pakistan was laid but the concept of pakistan came in 19th centurythe early medieval period 642–1219 ce witnessed the spread of islam in the region during this period sufi missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional buddhist and hindu population to islam these developments set the stage for the rule of several successive muslim empires in the region including the ghaznavid empire 975–1187 ce the ghorid kingdom and the delhi sultanate 1206–1526 ce the lodi dynasty the last of the delhi sultanate was replaced by the mughal empire 1526–1857 ce

the mughals introduced persian literature and high culture establishing the roots of indo-persian culture in the region from the region of modern-day pakistan key cities during the mughal rule were lahore and thatta both of which were chosen as the site of impressive mughal buildings in the early 16th century the region remained under the mughal empire ruled by muslim emperors by the early 18th century increasing european influence contributed to the slow disintegration of the mughal empire as the lines between commercial and political dominance became increasingly blurredduring this time the english east india company had established coastal outposts control over the seas greater resources technology and british military protection led the company to increasingly flex its military muscle allowing the company to gain control over the subcontinent by 1765 and sideline european competitors expanding access beyond bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of region by the 1820s many historians see this as the start of the regions colonial period by this time with its economic power severely curtailed by the british parliament and itself effectively made an arm of british administration the company began more deliberately to enter non-economic arenas such as education social reform and culture such reforms included the enforcement of the english education act in 1835 and the introduction of the indian civil service ics traditional madrasahs—primary institutions of higher learning for muslims in the subcontinent—were no longer supported by the english crown and nearly all of the madrasahs lost their financial endowment


 colonial period 

the gradual decline of the mughal empire in the early 18th century enabled the sikh empire to control larger areas until the british east india company gained ascendancy over south asia a rebellion in 1857 called the sepoy mutiny of bengal was the regions major armed struggle against the british empire and queen victoria divergence in the relationship between hinduism and islam created a major rift in british india that led to motivated religious violence in british india the language controversy further escalated the tensions between hindus and muslims the hindu renaissance witnessed an awakening of intellectualism in traditional hinduism and saw the emergence of more assertive influence in the social and political spheres in british india an intellectual movement to counter the hindu renaissance was led by sir syed ahmad khan who helped found the all-india muslim league in 1901 and envisioned as well as advocated for the two-nation theory in contrast to the indian national congresss anti-british efforts the muslim league was a pro-british movement whose political program inherited the british values that would shape pakistans future civil society in events during world war i british intelligence foiled an anti-english conspiracy involving the nexus of congress and the german empire the largely non-violent independence struggle led by the indian congress engaged millions of protesters in mass campaigns of civil disobedience in the 1920s and 1930s against the british empirethe muslim league slowly rose to mass popularity in the 1930s amid fears of under-representation and neglect of british muslims in politics in his presidential address of 29 december 1930 allama iqbal called for the amalgamation of north-west muslim-majority indian states consisting of punjab north-west frontier province sind and baluchistan the perceived neglect of muslim interests by congress led british provincial governments during the period of 1937–39 convinced muhammad ali jinnah the founder of pakistan to espouse the two-nation theory and led the muslim league to adopt the lahore resolution of 1940 presented by sher-e-bangla ak fazlul haque popularly known as the pakistan resolution in world war ii jinnah and british-educated founding fathers in the muslim league supported the united kingdoms war efforts countering opposition against it whilst working towards sir syeds vision


 pakistan movement 

the 1946 elections resulted in the muslim league winning 90 percent of the seats reserved for muslims thus the 1946 election was effectively a plebiscite in which the indian muslims were to vote on the creation of pakistan a plebiscite won by the muslim league this victory was assisted by the support given to the muslim league by the support of the landowners of sindh and punjab the congress which initially denied the muslim leagues claim of being the sole representative of indian muslims was now forced to recognise the fact the british had no alternative except to take jinnahs views into account as he had emerged as the sole spokesperson of the
entire british  indias muslims however the british did not want british india to be partitioned and in one last effort to prevent it they devised the cabinet mission planas the cabinet mission failed the british government announced its intention to end the british rule  in 1946–47 nationalists in british india—including jawaharlal nehru and abul kalam azad of congress jinnah of the all-india muslim league and master tara singh representing the sikhs—agreed to the proposed terms of transfer of power and independence in june 1947 with the viceroy of india lord mountbatten of burma as the united kingdom agreed to the partitioning of india in 1947 the modern state of pakistan was established on 14 august 1947 27th of ramadan in 1366 of the islamic calendar amalgamating the muslim-majority eastern and northwestern regions of british india it comprised the provinces of balochistan east bengal the north-west frontier province west punjab and sindhin the riots that accompanied the partition in punjab province it is believed that between 200,000 and 2,000,000 people were killed in what some have described as a retributive genocide between the religions while 50,000 muslim women were abducted and raped by hindu and sikh men and 33,000 hindu and sikh women also experienced the same fate at the hands of muslims around 6.5 million muslims moved from india to west pakistan and 4.7 million hindus and sikhs moved from west pakistan to india it was the largest mass migration in human history dispute over jammu and kashmir led to the first kashmir war in 1948

 role of islam in pakistan 

the idea of pakistan which had received overwhelming popular support among indian muslims especially those in the provinces of british india where muslims were in a minority such as the united provinces was articulated in terms of an islamic state by the muslim league leadership the ulama islamic clergy and jinnah jinnah had developed a close association with the ulama and upon his death was described by one such alim maulana shabbir ahmad usmani as the greatest muslim after aurangzeb and as someone who desired to unite the muslims of the world under the banner of islamthe objectives resolution in march 1949 which declared god as the sole sovereign over the entire universe represented the first formal step to transform pakistan into an islamic state muslim league leader chaudhry khaliquzzaman asserted that pakistan could only truly become an islamic state after bringing all believers of islam into a single political unit keith callard one of the earliest scholars on pakistani politics observed that pakistanis believed in the essential unity of purpose and outlook in the muslim world and assumed that muslim from other countries would share their views on the relationship between religion and nationality

however pakistans pan-islamist sentiments for a united islamic bloc called islamistan were not shared by other muslim governments although islamists such as the grand mufti of palestine al-haj amin al-husseini and leaders of the muslim brotherhood became drawn to the country pakistans desire for an international organization of muslim countries was fulfilled in the 1970s when the organization of islamic conference oic was formedthe strongest opposition to the islamist ideological paradigm being imposed on the state came from the bengali muslims of east pakistan whose educated class according to a survey by social scientist nasim ahmad jawed preferred secularism and focused on ethnic identity unlike educated west pakistanis who tended to prefer an islamic identity the islamist party jamaat-e-islami considered pakistan to be an islamic state and believed bengali nationalism to be unacceptable in the 1971 conflict over east pakistan the jamaat-e-islami fought the bengali nationalists on the pakistan armys sideafter pakistans first ever general elections the 1973 constitution was created by an elected parliament the constitution declared pakistan an islamic republic and islam as the state religion it also stated that all laws would have to be brought into accordance with the injunctions of islam as laid down in the quran and sunnah and that no law repugnant to such injunctions could be enacted the 1973 constitution also created certain institutions such as the shariat court and the council of islamic ideology to channel the interpretation and application of islampakistans leftist prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto faced vigorous opposition which coalesced into a movement united under the revivalist banner of nizam-e-mustafa rule of the prophet which aimed to establish an islamic state based on sharia laws bhutto agreed to some islamist demands before being overthrown in a coupin 1977 after taking power from bhutto in a coup detat general zia-ul-haq who came from a religious background committed himself to establishing an islamic state and enforcing sharia law zia established separate shariat judicial courts and court benches to judge legal cases using islamic doctrine zia bolstered the influence of the ulama islamic clergy and the islamic parties zia-ul-haq forged a strong alliance between the military and deobandi institutions and even though most barelvi ulama and only a few deobandi scholars had supported pakistans creation islamic state politics came to be mostly in favour of deobandi and later ahl-e-hadithsalafi institutions instead of barelvi sectarian tensions increased with zias anti-shia policiesaccording to a pew research center pew opinion poll a majority of pakistanis support making sharia the official law of the land in a survey of several muslim countries pew also found that pakistanis tend to identify with their religion more than their nationality in contrast to muslims in other nations such as egypt indonesia and jordan

 infrastructure 


 nuclear power and energy 

by the end of 2016 nuclear power was provided by four licensed commercial nuclear power plants the pakistan atomic energy commission paec is solely responsible for operating these power plants while the pakistan nuclear regulatory authority regulates safe usage of the nuclear energy the electricity generated by commercial nuclear power plants constitutes roughly 5.8% of pakistans electrical energy compared to 64.2% from fossil fuels crude oil and natural gas 29.9% from hydroelectric power and 0.1% from coal pakistan is one of the four nuclear armed states along with india israel and north korea that is not a party to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty but it is a member in good standing of the international atomic energy agency
the kanupp-i a candu-type nuclear reactor was supplied by canada in 1971—the countrys first commercial nuclear power plant the sino-pakistani nuclear cooperation began in the early 1980s after a sino-pakistani nuclear cooperation agreement in 1986 china provided pakistan with a nuclear reactor dubbed chasnupp-i for energy and industrial growth of the country in 2005 both countries proposed working on a joint energy security plan calling for a huge increase in generation capacity to more than 160,000 mwe by 2030 under its nuclear energy vision 2050 the pakistani government plans to increase nuclear power generation capacity to 40,000 mwe 8,900 mwe of it by 2030 in june 2008 the nuclear commercial complex was expanded with the ground work of installing and operationalising the chashma-iii and chashma–iv reactors at chashma punjab province each with 325–340 mwe and costing ₨ 129 billion from which the ₨ 80 billion came from international sources principally china a further agreement for chinas help with the project was signed in october 2008 and given prominence as a counter to the us–india agreement that shortly preceded it the cost quoted then was us1.7 billion with a foreign loan component of us1.07 billion in 2013 pakistan established a second commercial nuclear complex in karachi with plans of additional reactors similar to the one in chashma the electrical energy is generated by various energy corporations and evenly distributed by the national electric power regulatory authority nepra among the four provinces however the karachi-based k-electric and the water and power development authority wapda generates much of the electrical energy used in pakistan in addition to gathering revenue nationwide as of  2014 pakistan has an installed electricity generation capacity of 22,797mwt
