a near-earth object neo is any small solar system body whose orbit brings it to proximity with earth by convention a solar system body is a neo if its closest approach to the sun perihelion is less than 1.3 astronomical units au if a neos orbit crosses the earths and the object is larger than 140 meters 460 ft across it is considered a potentially hazardous object pho most known phos and neos are asteroids but a small fraction are cometsthere are over 19,000 known near-earth asteroids neas over a hundred short-period near-earth comets necs and a number of solar-orbiting spacecraft and meteoroids large enough to be tracked in space before striking the earth it is now widely accepted that collisions in the past have had a significant role in shaping the geological and biological history of the earth neos have become of increased interest since the 1980s because of greater awareness of the potential danger some of the asteroids or comets pose when impacting the earth asteroids as small as 20 m cause sufficiently strong shock waves and heat to damage the local environment and populations larger asteroids penetrate the atmosphere to the surface of the earth producing craters if they hit ground and tsunamis if water bodies are hit it is in principle possible to deflect asteroids and methods of mitigation are being researchedbased on the orbit calculations of identified neos their risk of future impact is assessed on two scales the torino scale and the more complex palermo scale both of which rate a risk of any significance with values above 0 some neos have had temporarily positive torino or palermo scale ratings after their discovery but as of  march 2018 more precise calculations based on subsequent observations led to a reduction of the rating to or below 0 in all casessince 1998 the united states the european union and other nations are scanning for neos in an effort called spaceguard the initial us congress mandate to nasa of cataloging at least 90% of neos that are at least 1 kilometre 0.62 mi in diameter which would cause a global catastrophe in case of an impact with earth had been met by 2011 in later years the survey effort has been expanded to objects as small as about 140 m 460 ft across which still have the potential for large-scale though not global damage
due to their earth-like orbits and low surface gravity neos are easy targets for spacecraft as of  august 2018 five near-earth comets and three near-earth asteroids have been visited by spacecraft and probes are en route to two more neas plans to mine neas commercially have been drafted by private companies


 definitions 

the major technical astronomical definition for near-earth objects neos are small solar system bodies with orbits around the sun that by definition lie partly between 0.983 perihelion and 1.3 aphelion astronomical units au sun–earth distance away from the sun thus neos are not necessarily currently near the earth but they can potentially approach the earth relatively closely  however the term is also used more flexibly sometimes for example for objects in orbit around the earth or for quasi-satellites which have a more complex orbital relationship with the earth
when a neo is detected like all other small solar system bodies it is submitted to the international astronomical unions iaus minor planet center mpc for cataloging mpc maintains separate lists of confirmed neos and potential neos the orbits of some neos intersect that of the earth so they pose a collision danger these are considered potentially hazardous objects phos for the asteroids among phos the potentially hazardous asteroids phas mpc maintains a separate list neos are also catalogued by two separate units of the jet propulsion laboratory jpl of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the center for near earth object studies cneos and the solar system dynamics groupphas are currently defined based on parameters relating to their potential to approach the earth dangerously closely mostly objects with an earth minimum orbit intersection distance moid of 0.05 au or less and an absolute magnitude of 22.0 or brighter a rough indicator of large size are considered phas objects that cannot approach closer to the earth ie moid than 0.05 au 7,500,000 km 4,600,000 mi or are smaller than about 140 m 460 ft in diameter ie h  22.0 with assumed albedo of 14 are not considered phas nasas catalog of near-earth objects also includes the approach distances of asteroids and comets expressed in lunar distances


 history of human awareness of neos 

the first near-earth objects to be observed by humans were comets their extraterrestrial nature was recognised and confirmed only after tycho brahe tried to measure the distance of a comet through its parallax in 1577 and the periodicity of some comets was recognised in 1705 when edmond halley first published his orbit calculations for the returning object now known as halleys comet the 1758–1759 return of halleys comet was the first comet appearance predicted in advancethe first near-earth asteroid to be discovered was 433 eros in 1898 the asteroid was subject to several observation campaigns because measurements of its orbit enabled a precise determination of the distance of the earth from the sun in has been said that lexells comet of 1770 was the first discovered near-earth objectin 1937 asteroid 69230 hermes was discovered when it passed the earth at twice the distance of the moon hermes was considered a threat because it was lost after its discovery thus its orbit and potential for collision with earth were not known precisely hermes was re-discovered in 2003 and is now known to be no threat for at least the next centuryon june 14 1968 the 1.4 km diameter asteroid 1566 icarus passed earth at a distance of 0.042482 au 6,355,200 km or 16 times the distance of the moon during this approach icarus became the first minor planet to be observed using radar with measurements obtained at the haystack observatory and the goldstone tracking station this was the first close approach predicted years in advance icarus had been discovered in 1949 and also earned significant public attention due to alarmist news reports a year before the approach mit students launched project icarus devising a plan to deflect the asteroid with rockets in case it was found to be on a collision course with earth project icarus received wide media coverage and inspired the 1979 disaster movie meteor in which the us and the ussr join forces to blow up an earth-bound fragment of an asteroid hit by a cometon march 23 1989 the 300 m 980 ft diameter apollo asteroid 4581 asclepius 1989 fc missed the earth by 700,000 km 430,000 mi if the asteroid had impacted it would have created the largest explosion in recorded history equivalent to 20,000 megatons of tnt it attracted widespread attention because it was discovered only after the closest approachin march 1998 early orbit calculations for recently discovered asteroid 35396 1997 xf11 showed a potential 2028 close approach 0.00031 au 46,000 km from the earth well within the orbit of the moon but with a large error margin allowing for a direct hit further data allowed a revision of the 2028 approach distance to 0.0064 au 960,000 km with no chance of collision by that time inaccurate reports of a potential impact had caused a media storm


 risk 

from the late 1990s a typical frame of reference in searches for neos has been the scientific concept of risk the risk that any near-earth object poses is viewed having regard to both the culture and the technology of human society through history humans have associated neos with changing risks based on religious philosophical or scientific views as well as humanitys technological or economical capability to deal with such risks thus neos have been seen as omens of natural disasters or wars harmless spectacles in an unchanging universe the source of era-changing cataclysms or potentially poisonous fumes during earths passage through the tail of halleys comet in 1910 and finally as a possible cause of a crater-forming impact that could even cause extinction of humans and other life on earththe potential of catastrophic impacts by near-earth comets was recognised as soon as the first orbit calculations provided an understanding of their orbits in 1694 edmond halley presented a theory that noahs flood in the bible was caused by a comet impact human perception of near-earth asteroids as benign objects of fascination or killer objects with high risk to human society has ebbed and flowed during the short time that neas have been scientifically observed scientists have recognised the threat of impacts that create craters much bigger than the impacting bodies and have indirect effects on an even wider area since the 1980s after the confirmation of a theory that the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event in which dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago was caused by a large asteroid impactthe awareness of the wider public of the impact risk rose after the observation of the impact of the fragments of comet shoemaker–levy 9 into jupiter in july 1994 in 1998 the movies deep impact and armageddon popularised the notion that near-earth objects could cause catastrophic impacts also at that time a conspiracy theory arose about the supposed 2003 impact of the fictitious planet nibiru which persisted on the internet as the predicted impact date was moved to 2012 and then 2017


 risk scales 
there are two schemes for the scientific classification of impact hazards from neos

the simple torino scale which rates the risks of impacts in the next 100 years according to impact energy and impact probability using integer numbers between 0 and 10 and
the more complex palermo technical impact hazard scale which ascribes ratings that can be any positive or negative real number these ratings depend on the background impact frequency impact probability and time until possible impacton both scales risks of any concern are indicated by values above zero


 magnitude of risk 
the annual background frequency used in the palermo scale for impacts of energy greater than e megatonnes is estimated as

  
    
      
        
          f
          
            b
          
        
        
        0.03
        
          e
          
            −
            0.8
          
        
        
      
    
    displaystyle fb0.03e-0.8
  for instance this formula implies that the expected value of the time from now until the next impact greater than 1 megatonne is 33 years and that when it occurs there is a 50% chance that it will be above 2.4 megatonnes this formula is only valid over a certain range of e
however another paper published in 2002 – the same year as the paper on that the palermo scale is based – found a power law with different constants

  
    
      
        
          f
          
            b
          
        
        
        0.00737
        
          e
          
            −
            0.9
          
        
        
      
    
    displaystyle fb0.00737e-0.9
  this formula gives considerably lower rates for a given e for instance it gives the rate for bolides of 10 megatonnes or more like the tunguska explosion as 1 per thousand years rather than 1 per 210 years as in the palermo formula however the authors give a rather large uncertainty once in 400 to 1800 years for 10 megatonnes due in part to uncertainties in determining the energies of the atmospheric impacts that they used in their determination


 highly rated risks 
nasa maintains an automated system to evaluate the threat from known neos over the next 100 years which generates the continuously updated sentry risk table all or nearly all of the objects are highly likely to drop off the list eventually as more observations come in reducing the uncertainties and enabling more accurate orbital predictionsin march 2002 163132 2002 cu11 became the first asteroid with a positive rating on the torino scale with about a 1 in 9,300 chance of an impact in 2049 after more observations the estimated risk was reduced to zero and the asteroid was removed from the sentry risk table in april 2002 it is now estimated with some certainty that in the next two centuries 2002 cu11 will pass the earth safely at a closest distance perigee of 0.00425 au 636,000 km 395,000 mi on august 31 2080

asteroid 1950 da was lost after its 1950 discovery since its observations over just 17 days were insufficient to determine its orbit it was rediscovered on december 31 2000 it has a diameter of about a kilometer 0.6 miles it was also observed by radar during its close approach in 2001 allowing much more precise orbit calculations although this asteroid will not strike for at least 800 years and thus has no torino scale rating it was added to the sentry list in april 2002 because it was the first object with a palermo scale value greater than zero the then-calculated 1 in 300 maximum chance of impact and 0.17 palermo scale value was roughly 50% greater than the background risk of impact by all similarly large objects until 2880 uncertainties in the orbit calculations were further reduced using radar observations in 2012 and this decreased the odds of an impact taking all radar and optical observations until 2015 into account the probability of impact is as of  march 2018 assessed at 1 in 8,300 the corresponding palermo scale value of −1.42 is still the highest for all objects on the sentry list table as of  march 2018 only one more object 2009 fd has a palermo scale value above −2 for a single impact dateon december 24 2004 370 m 1,210 ft asteroid 99942 apophis at the time known by its provisional designation 2004 mn4 was assigned a 4 on the torino scale the highest rating ever given as there was a 2.7% chance of earth impact on april 13 2029 by december 28 2004 additional observations had produced a smaller uncertainty zone which no longer included the earth during the 2029 approach the 2029 risk of impact consequently dropped to zero but later potential impact solutions were still rated 1 on the torino scale the 2036 risk was lowered to a torino rating of 0 in august 2006 as of  march 2018 calculations show apophis has no chance of impacting earth before 2060in february 2006 144898 2004 vd17 has been assigned a torino scale rating of 2 due to a close encounter predicted for may 4 2102 after more precise calculations the rating was lowered to 1 in may 2006 and 0 in october 2006 and the asteroid was removed from the sentry risk table entirely in february 2008as of  march 2018 2010 rf12 is listed with the highest chance of impacting earth at 1 in 20 on september 5 2095 at only 7 m 23 ft across the asteroid however does not pose a serious threat the possible 2095 impact therefore rates only −3.32 on the palermo scale


 projects to minimize the threat 

the first astronomical program dedicated to the discovery of near-earth asteroids was the palomar planet-crossing asteroid survey started in 1973 by astronomers eugene shoemaker and eleanor helin the link to impact hazard the need for dedicated survey telescopes and options to head off an eventual impact were first discussed at a 1981 interdisciplinary conference in snowmass colorado plans for a more comprehensive survey named the spaceguard survey were developed by nasa from 1992 under a mandate from the united states congress to promote the survey on an international level the international astronomical union iau organised a workshop at vulcano italy in 1995 and set up the spaceguard foundation also in italy a year later in 1998 the united states congress gave nasa a mandate to detect of 90% of near-earth asteroids over 1 km 0.62 mi diameter that threaten global devastation by 2008several surveys have undertaken spaceguard activities an umbrella term including lincoln near-earth asteroid research linear spacewatch near-earth asteroid tracking neat lowell observatory near-earth-object search loneos catalina sky survey css campo imperatore near-earth object survey cineos japanese spaceguard association asiago-dlr asteroid survey adas and near-earth object wise neowise as a result the ratio of the known and the estimated total number of near-earth asteroids larger than 1 km in diameter rose from about 20% in 1998 to 65% in 2004 80% in 2006 and 93% in 2011 the original spaceguard goal has thus been met only three years late as of  june 12 2018 893 neas larger than 1 km have been discovered or 97% of an estimated total of about 920in 2005 the original usa spaceguard mandate was extended by the george e brown jr near-earth object survey act which calls for nasa to detect 90% of neos with diameters of 140 m 460 ft or greater by 2020 in january 2016 nasa announced the creation of the planetary defense coordination office pdco to track neos larger than about 30–50 m 98–164 ft in diameter and coordinate an effective threat response and mitigation effortsurvey programs aim to identify threats years in advance giving humanity time to prepare a space mission to avert the threat

the atlas project by contrast aims to find impacting asteroids shortly before impact much too late for deflection maneuvers but still in time to evacuate and otherwise prepare the affected earth region another project the zwicky transient facility ztf which surveys for objects that change their brightness rapidly also detects asteroids passing close to earthscientists involved in neo research have also considered options for actively averting the threat from an object found to be on a collision course with earth all viable methods aim to deflect rather than destroy the threatening neo because the fragments would still cause widespread destruction deflection which means a change in the objects orbit months to years prior to the predicted impact also requires orders of magnitude less energy


 number and classification 

near-earth objects are classified as meteoroids asteroids or comets depending on size and composition asteroids can also be members of an asteroid family and comets create meteoroid streams that can generate meteor showers
as of  january 8 2019 according to statistics maintained by cneos 19,470 neos have been discovered only 107 0.55 of them are comets whilst 19,363 99.45 are asteroids there are 1,955 neos that are classified as potentially hazardous asteroids phas discovery is heavily influenced by the opposition effect see diagram below
as of  january 8 2019 there are 893 neas on the sentry impact risk page at the nasa website a significant number of these neas are equal to or smaller than 50 meters in diameter and none of the listed objects are placed even in the green zone torino scale 1 meaning that none warrant the attention of general public


 observational biases 
one problem with estimating the number of neos is that detections are influenced by a number of factors  observational biases need to be taken into account when trying to calculate the number of bodies in a population  what is easily detected will be more countedfor example it has been easier to spot objects on the night-side of earth  there is less noise from twilight and the searcher is looking at the sunlit side of the asteroids  in the daytime sky a searcher looking towards the sun sees the backside of the object eg comparing a full moon at night to a new moon in daytime  in addition opposition surge make them even brighter when the earth is along the axis of sunlight finally the day sky near the sun is bright the light of sun hitting asteroids has been called full asteroid similar to a full moon and the greater amount of light creates a bias that they are easier to detect in this casein the year 2000 it was predicted that there are 900 near earth asteroids of at least kilometer size taking into account known observational biases studies of asteroid populations try to take into account observational selection biases to make a more accurate assessment finding observational biases can help determine neo populations for example one study noted that bodies in low-eccentricity earth-crossing  orbits were favored making the detection of aten more favored than apollostwo of the biggest near-earth objects 433 eros and 1036 ganymed were naturally also some the earliest to be detected 1036 ganymed is about 20 miles in diameter as bigger asteroids they reflected more light  one way around this bias is to use thermal infrared telescopes that observe their heat emissionsevidencing this bias over half 53 of the discoveries of near earth objects were made in 3.8% of the sky in a 22.5° cone facing directly away from the sun and the vast majority 87 were made in 15% of the sky in a 45° cone facing away from the sun


 near-earth asteroids 

these are objects in a near-earth orbit without the tail or coma of a comet as of  january 6 2019 19,363 near-earth asteroids are known only 1,955 of which are phasneas survive in their orbits for just a few million years they are eventually eliminated by planetary perturbations causing ejection from the solar system or a collision with the sun or a planet with orbital lifetimes short compared to the age of the solar system new asteroids must be constantly moved into near-earth orbits to explain the observed asteroids the accepted origin of these asteroids is that main-belt asteroids are moved into the inner solar system through orbital resonances with jupiter the interaction with jupiter through the resonance perturbs the asteroids orbit and it comes into the inner solar system the asteroid belt has gaps known as kirkwood gaps where these resonances occur as the asteroids in these resonances have been moved onto other orbits new asteroids migrate into these resonances due to the yarkovsky effect that provides a continuing supply of near-earth asteroids compared to the entire mass of the asteroid belt the mass loss necessary to sustain the nea population is relatively small totalling less than 6% over the past 3.5 billion years the composition of near-earth asteroids is comparable to that of asteroids from the asteroid belt reflecting a variety of asteroid spectral typesa small number of neas are extinct comets that have lost their volatile surface materials although having a faint or intermittent comet-like tail does not necessarily result in a classification as a near-earth comet making the boundaries somewhat fuzzy the rest of the near-earth asteroids are driven out of the asteroid belt by gravitational interactions with jupitermany asteroids have natural satellites minor-planet moons as of  march 15 2017 66 neas were known to have at least one moon including three known to have two moons the asteroid 3122 florence one of the largest phas with a diameter of 4.5 km 2.8 mi has two moons measuring 100–300 m 330–980 ft across which were discovered by radar imaging during the asteroids 2017 approach to earth


 size distribution 

while a small fraction of these asteroids has accurate direct diameter measurements from radar observations from images of the asteroid surface or from stellar occultations the size of the vast majority of near earth asteroids can only be estimated on the basis of their brightness and a representative asteroid albedo or surface reflectivity which is commonly assumed to be 14 such indirect size estimates are uncertain by a factor of 2 for individual asteroids since asteroid albedos can range at least as low as 0.05 and as high as 0.3 using this method an absolute magnitude of 17.75 roughly corresponds to a diameter of 1 km 0.62 mi and an absolute magnitude of 22.0 corresponds to a diameter of 140 m 460 ft  
in may 2016 the precision of asteroid diameter estimates arising from the wide-field infrared survey explorer and neowise missions was questioned by technologist nathan myhrvold although the early original criticism did not pass peer review and faced criticism for its methodology itself a more recent peer-reviewed study was subsequently publishedas of january 4 2019 and mostly using the crude estimate from an absolute magnitude 897 neas listed by cneos including 156 phas measure at least 1 km in diameter and 8,452 known neas are larger than 140 m in diameter
the smallest known near-earth asteroid is 2008 ts26 with an absolute magnitude of 33.2 corresponding to a diameter of about 1 m 3.3 ft the largest such object is 1036 ganymed with an absolute magnitude of 9.45 and a diameter of about 38 km 24 miin 2000 nasa reduced its estimate of the number of existing near-earth asteroids over one kilometer in diameter from 1,000–2,000 to 500–1,000 shortly thereafter  the linear survey provided an alternative estimate  of 1,227170−90 in 2011 on the basis of neowise observations the estimated number of one-kilometer neas was narrowed to 981±19 of which 93% had been discovered at the time while the number of neas larger than 140 meters across was estimated at 13,200±1,900 the neowise estimate differed from other estimates in assuming a slightly lower average asteroid albedo which produces larger estimated diameters for the same asteroid brightness this resulted in 911 then known asteroids at least 1 km across as opposed to the 830 then listed by cneos in 2017 using an improved statistical method two studies reduced the estimated number of neas brighter than absolute magnitude 17.75 approximately over one kilometer in diameter to 921±20 the estimated number of asteroids brighter than absolute magnitude of 22.0 approximately over 140 m across rose to 27,100±2,200 double the wise estimate of which about a third are known as of 2018
the number of asteroids brighter than h  25 which corresponds to about 40 m 130 ft in diameter is estimated at about 840,000±23,000—of which about 1.3 percent had been discovered by february 2016 the number of asteroids brighter than h  30 larger than 3.5 m 11 ft is estimated at about 400±100 million—of which about 0.003 percent had been discovered by february 2016


 orbital classification 

near-earth asteroids are divided into groups based on their semi-major axis a perihelion distance q and aphelion distance q
the atiras or apoheles have orbits strictly inside earths orbit an atira asteroids aphelion distance q is smaller than earths perihelion distance 0.983 au that is q  0.983 au this implies that the asteroids semi-major axis is also less than 0.983 au
the atens have a semi-major axis of less than 1 au and cross earths orbit mathematically a  1.0 au and q  0.983 au
the apollos have a semi-major axis of more than 1 au and cross earths orbit mathematically a  1.0 au and q  1.017 au 1.017 au is earths aphelion distance
the amors have orbits strictly outside earths orbit an amor asteroids perihelion distance q is greater than earths aphelion distance 1.017 au amor asteroids are also near-earth objects so q  1.3 au in summary 1.017 au  q  1.3 au this implies that the asteroids semi-major axis a is also larger than 1.017 au some amor asteroid orbits cross the orbit of marsnote some authors define atens differently they define it as being all the asteroids with a semi-major axis of less than 1 au that is they consider the atiras to be part of the atens historically until 1998 there were no known or suspected atiras so the distinction wasnt necessary
atiras and amors do not cross the earths orbit and are not immediate impact threats but their orbits may change to become earth-crossing orbits in the futureas of  may 10 2018 17 atiras 1,342 atens 9,964 apollos and 6,813 amors have been discovered and cataloged


 co-orbital asteroids 

neas on a co-orbital configuration have the same orbital period as the earth all co-orbital asteroids have special orbits that are relatively stable and paradoxically can prevent them from getting close to earth

trojans near the orbit of a planet there are five gravitational equilibrium points the lagrangian points in which an asteroid would orbit the sun in fixed formation with the planet two of these 60 degrees ahead and behind the planet along its orbit designated l4 and l5 respectively are stable that is an asteroid near these points would stay there for millions of years even if perturbed by other planets and non-gravitational forces as of  march 2018 earths only confirmed trojan is 2010 tk7 circling earths l4 point
horseshoe librators the region of stability around l4 and l5 also includes orbits for co-orbital asteroids that run around both l4 and l5 seen from earth the orbit can resemble the circumference of a horseshoe or may consist of annual loops that wander back and forth librate in a horseshoe-shaped area in both cases the sun is at the horseshoes center of gravity earth is in the gap of the horseshoe and l4 and l5 are inside the ends of the horseshoe by 2016 12 horseshoe librators of earth have been discovered the most-studied and at about 5 km 3.1 mi largest is 3753 cruithne which travels along bean-shaped annual loops and completes its horseshoe libration cycle every 770 to 780 years 419624 2010 so16 is an asteroid on a relatively stable circumference-of-a-horseshoe orbit with a horseshoe libration period of about 350 years
quasi-satellites quasi-satellites are co-orbital asteroids on a normal elliptic orbit with a higher eccentricity than earths which they travel in a way synchronised with earths motion since the asteroid orbits the sun slower than earth when further away and faster than earth when closer to the sun when observed from earth the quasi-satellite appears to orbit earth in a retrograde direction in one year even though it is not bound gravitationally by 2016 five asteroids were known to be a quasi-satellite of earth 469219 2016 ho3 is earths closest quasi-satellite in an orbit that has been stable for almost a century orbit calculations until 2016 showed that all quasi-satellites and four of the horseshoe librators then known repeatedly transfer between horseshoe and quasi-satellite orbits one of these objects 2003 yn107 was observed during its transition from a quasi-satellite orbit to a horseshoe orbit in 2006 it is expected to transfer back to a quasi-satellite orbit 60 years later
temporary satellites neas can also transfer between solar orbits and distant earth orbits becoming gravitationally bound temporary satellites according to simulations temporary satellites are typically caught when they pass the l1 or l2 lagrangian points and earth has at least one temporary satellite 1 m 3.3 ft across at any given time but they are too faint to detect by current surveys as of  march 2018 the only observed transition was that of asteroid 2006 rh120 which was a temporary satellite from september 2006 to june 2007 and has been on a solar orbit with a 1.003-year period ever since according to orbital calculations on its solar orbit 2006 rh120 passes earth at low speed every 20 to 21 years at which point it can become a temporary satellite again


 meteoroids 
in 1961 the iau defined meteoroids as a class of solid interplanetary objects distinct from asteroids by their considerably smaller size this definition was useful at the time because with the exception of the tunguska event all historically observed meteors were produced by objects significantly smaller than the smallest asteroids observable by telescopes as the distinction began to blur with the discovery of ever smaller asteroids and a greater variety of observed neo impacts revised definitions with size limits have been proposed from the 1990s in april 2017 the iau adopted a revised definition that generally limits meteoroids to a size between 30 μm and 1 m in diameter but permits the use of the term for any object of any size that caused a meteor thus leaving the distinction between asteroid and meteoroid blurred


 near-earth comets 

near-earth comets necs are objects in a near-earth orbit with a tail or coma comet nuclei are typically less dense than asteroids but they pass earth at higher relative speeds thus the impact energy of comet nucleus is slightly larger than that of a similar-sized asteroid necs may pose an additional hazard due to fragmentation the meteoroid streams which produce meteor showers may include large inactive fragments effectively neas although no impact of a comet in earths history has been conclusively confirmed the tunguska event may have been caused by a fragment of comet enckecomets are commonly divided between short-period and long-period comets short-period comets with an orbital period of less than 200 years originated in the kuiper belt beyond the orbit of neptune while long-period comets originate in the oort cloud in the outer reaches of the solar system the orbital period distinction is of importance in the evaluation of the risk from near-earth comets because short-period necs are likely to have been observed during multiple apparitions and thus their orbits can be determined with some precision while long-period necs can be assumed to have been seen for the first and last time when they appeared during the age of science thus their approaches cannot be predicted well in advance since the threat from long-period necs is estimated to be at most 1% of the threat from neas and long-period comets are very faint and thus difficult to detect at large distances from the sun spaceguard efforts consistently focused on asteroids and short-period comets cneos even restricts its definition of necs to short-period comets—as of  may 10 2018 107 such objects have been discoveredas of  march 2018 only 20 comets have been observed to pass within 0.1 au 15,000,000 km 9,300,000 mi of earth including 10 which are or have been short-period comets two of these comets halleys comet and 73pschwassmann–wachmann have been observed during multiple close approaches the closest observed approach was 0.0151 au 5.88 ld for lexells comet on july 1 1770 after an orbit change due to a close approach of jupiter in 1779 this object is no longer a nec the closest approach ever observed for a current short-period nec is 0.0229 au 8.92 ld for comet tempel–tuttle in 1366 this comet is the parent body of the leonid meteor shower which also produced the great meteor storm of 1833 orbital calculations show that p1999 j6 soho a faint sungrazing comet and confirmed short-period nec observed only during its close approaches to the sun passed earth undetected at a distance of 0.0121 au 4.70 ld on june 12 1999comet 109pswift–tuttle which is also the source of the perseid meteor shower which hits earth every year in august has a roughly 130-year orbit which passes close to the earth after the comets 1992 return when only the two previous returns in 1862 and 1737 have been identified orbital calculations showed that the comet would pass very close to earth during its next return in 2126 with an impact within the range of uncertainty by 1993 even earlier returns back to at least 188 ad have been identified and the new orbital calculation eliminated the impact risk predicting the comet to pass earth in 2126 at a distance of 24 million kilometers in 3044 the comet is expected to pass earth at less than 1.6 million kilometers


 artificial near-earth objects 

defunct space probes and final stages of rockets can end up in near-earth orbits around the sun and be re-discovered by neo surveys when they return to earths vicinity
in september 2002 astronomers found an object designated j002e3 the object was on a temporary satellite orbit around earth leaving for a solar orbit in june 2003 calculations showed that it was also on a solar orbit before 2002 but was close to earth in 1971 j002e3 was identified as the third stage of the saturn v rocket that carried apollo 12 to the moon in 2006 two more apparent temporary satellites were discovered which were suspected of being artificial one of them was eventually confirmed as an asteroid and classified as the temporary satellite 2006 rh120 the other 6q0b44e was confirmed as an artificial object but its identity is unknown another confirmed artificial temporary satellite with unidentified origin is 2013 qw1in some cases active space probes on solar orbits have been observed by neo surveys and erroneously catalogued as asteroids before identification during its 2007 flyby of earth on its route to a comet esas space probe rosetta was detected unidentified and classified as asteroid 2007 vn84 with an alert issued due to its close approach the designation 2015 hp116 was similarly removed from asteroid catalogues when the observed object was identified with gaia esas space observatory for astrometry


 impacts 

when a near-earth object impacts earth objects up to a few tens of metres across ordinarily explode in the upper atmosphere usually harmlessly with most or all of the solids vaporized while larger objects hit the water surface forming waves or the solid surface forming impact cratersthe frequency of impacts of objects of various sizes is estimated on the basis of orbit simulations of neo populations the frequency of impact craters on the earth and the moon and the frequency of close encounters the study of impact craters indicates that impact frequency has been more or less steady for the past 3.5 billion years which requires a steady replenishment of the neo population from the asteroid main belt one impact model based on widely accepted neo population models estimates the average time between the impact of two stony asteroids with a diameter of at least 4 m 13 ft at about one year for asteroids 7 m 23 ft across which impacts with as much energy as the atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima approximately 15 kilotonnes of tnt at five years for asteroids 60 m 200 ft across an impact energy of 10 megatons comparable to the tunguska event in 1908 at 1,300 years for asteroids 1 km 0.62 mi across at half a million years and for asteroids 5 km 3.1 mi across at 18 million years some other models estimate similar impact frequencies while others calculate higher frequencies for tunguska-sized 10-megaton impacts there are estimates of one event every 2,000–3,000 years and one event every 300 years

the second-largest observed impact after the tunguska meteor was a 1.1-megaton air blast near the prince edward islands off the coast of south africa in 1963 which was detected only by infrasound sensors the third-largest but most-observed impact was the chelyabinsk meteor of february 15 2013 a 20 m 66 ft asteroid exploded with the equivalent blast yield of 400–500 kilotons the calculated orbit of the pre-impact asteroid is similar to that of apollo asteroid 2011 eo40 making the latter the meteors possible parent bodyon october 7 2008 19 hours after it has been first observed 4 m 13 ft asteroid 2008 tc3 blew up 37 km 23 mi above the nubian desert in sudan it was the first time that an asteroid was observed and its impact had been predicted prior to its entry into the atmosphere as a meteor 10.7 kg of meteorites were recovered after the impacton january 2 2014 just 21 hours after it was the first asteroid to be discovered in 2014 2–4 m 2014 aa blew up in earths atmosphere above the atlantic ocean far from any land the meteor explosion was only observed by three infrasound detectors of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty organization this impact was the second to be predicted in advanceasteroid impact prediction is however in its infancy and successfully predicted asteroid impacts are rare the vast majority of impacts recorded by infrasound sensors designed to detect detonation of nuclear devices are not predicted in advance
observed impacts arent restricted to the surface and atmosphere of earth dust-sized neos have impacted man-made spacecraft including nasas long duration exposure facility which collected interplanetary dust in low earth orbit for six years from 1984 impacts on the moon can be observed as flashes of light with a typical duration of a fraction of a second the first lunar impacts were recorded during the 1999 leonid storm subsequently several continuous monitoring programs were launched as of  march 2018 the largest observed lunar impact occurred on september 11 2013 lasted 8 seconds and was likely caused by an object 0.6–1.4 m 2.0–4.6 ft in diameter


 close approaches 

each year several mostly small neos pass earth closer than the distance of the moonon august 10 1972 a meteor that became known as the 1972 great daylight fireball was witnessed by many people it moved north over the rocky mountains from the us southwest to canada it was an earth-grazing meteoroid that passed within 57 km 35 mi of the earths surface and was filmed by a tourist at the grand teton national park in wyoming with an 8-millimeter color movie cameraon october 13 1990 earth-grazing meteoroid en131090 was observed above czechoslovakia and poland moving at 41.74 kms 25.94 mis along a 409 km 254 mi trajectory from south to north the closest approach to the earth was 98.67 km 61.31 mi above the surface it was captured by two all-sky cameras of the european fireball network which for the first time enabled geometric calculations of the orbit of such a bodyon march 18 2004 linear announced that a 30 m 98 ft asteroid 2004 fh would pass the earth that day at only 42,600 km 26,500 mi about one-tenth the distance to the moon and the closest miss ever noticed until then they estimated that similar-sized asteroids come as close about every two yearson march 31 2004 two weeks after 2004 fh 2004 fu162 set a new record for closest recorded approach above the atmosphere passing earths surface only 6,500 km 4,000 mi away about one earth radius or one-sixtieth of the distance to the moon because it was very small 6 meters20 feet fu162 was detected only hours before its closest approach if it had collided with earth it probably would have disintegrated harmlessly in the atmosphereon february 4 2011 an asteroid designated 2011 cq1 estimated at 0.8–2.6 m 2.6–8.5 ft in diameter passed within 5,500 km 3,400 mi of the earth setting a new record for closest approach without impact which still stands as of  september 2018on november 8 2011 asteroid 308635 2005 yu55 relatively large at about 360 m 1,180 ft in diameter passed within 324,600 km 201,700 mi 0.85 lunar distances of earthon february 15 2013 the 30 m 98 ft asteroid 367943 duende 2012 da14 passed approximately 27,700 km 17,200 mi above the surface of earth closer than satellites in geosynchronous orbit the asteroid was not visible to the unaided eye this was the first close passage of an object discovered during a previous passage and was thus the first to be predicted well in advance


 exploratory missions 
some neos are of special interest because they can be physically explored with lower mission velocity than is necessary for even the moon due to their combination of low velocity with respect to earth and weak gravity they may present interesting scientific opportunities both for direct geochemical and astronomical investigation and as potentially economical sources of extraterrestrial materials for human exploitation this makes them an attractive target for exploration


 missions to neas 

the iau held a minor planets workshop in tucson arizona in march 1971 at that point launching a spacecraft to asteroids was considered premature the workshop only inspired the first astronomical survey specifically aiming for neas missions to asteroids were considered again during a workshop at the university of chicago held by nasas office of space science in january 1978 of all of the near-earth asteroids nea that had been discovered by mid-1977 it was estimated that spacecraft could rendezvous with and return from only about 1 in 10 using less propulsive energy than is necessary to reach mars it was recognised that due to the low surface gravity of all neas moving around on the surface of a nea would cost very little energy and thus space probes could gather multiple samples overall it was estimated that about one percent of all neas might provide opportunities for human-crewed missions or no more than about ten neas known at the time a five-fold increase in the nea discovery rate was deemed necessary to make a manned mission within ten years worthwhilethe first near-earth asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft was 17 km 11 mi asteroid 433 eros when nasas near earth asteroid rendezvous near probe orbited it from february 2001 landing on the asteroid surface in february 2002 a second near-earth asteroid the 535 m 1,755 ft long peanut-shaped 25143 itokawa was visited in september 2005 by jaxas hayabusa mission which succeeded in taking material samples back to earth a third near-earth asteroid the 2.26 km 1.40 mi long elongated 4179 toutatis was explored by cnsas change 2 spacecraft during a flyby in december 2012

the 980 m 3,220 ft apollo asteroid 162173 ryugu is the target of jaxas hayabusa 2 mission the space probe was launched in december 2014 is expected to arrive at the asteroid in june 2018 and to return a sample to earth in december 2020 the 500 m 1,600 ft apollo asteroid 101955 bennu which as of  march 2018 has the second-highest cumulative palermo scale rating −1.71 for several close encounters between 2175 and 2199 is the target of nasas osiris-rex probe the new frontiers program mission was launched in september 2016 on its two-year journey to bennu the probe is searching for earths trojan asteroids will rendezvous with bennu in august 2018 and will return samples from the asteroid in september 2023in april 2012 the company planetary resources announced its plans to mine asteroids commercially in a first phase the company reviewed data and selected potential targets among neas in a second phase space probes would be sent to the selected neas mining spacecraft would be sent in a third phase planetary resources launched two testbed satellites in april 2015 and january 2018 and the first prospecting satellite for the second phase is planned for a 2020 launch
