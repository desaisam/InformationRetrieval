if two states work together to launch a space object then both of those states are jointly and severally liable for the damage that object causes this means that the injured party can sue either of the two states for the full amount of damage


 claims between states only 
claims under the liability convention must be brought by the state against a state the convention was created to supplement existing and future national laws providing compensation to parties injured by space activities whereas under most national legal systems an individual or a corporation may bring a lawsuit against another individual or another corporation under the liability convention claims must be brought on the state level only this means that if an individual is injured by a space object and wishes to seek compensation under the liability convention the individual must arrange for his or her country to make a claim against the country that launched the space object that caused the damage
