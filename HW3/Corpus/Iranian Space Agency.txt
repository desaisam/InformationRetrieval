 space centers 

the main launch site of the iranian space agency is emamshahr located at 36°25′0″n 55°01′0″e where suborbital shahab 3s lv have been launched
qom located at 34°39′0″n 50°54′0″e is the other launch siteon occasion of the inaugural  launch of irans first safir-class sub-orbital rocket called kavoshgar-1 explorer-1 iran unveiled on 4 february 2008 its first satellite launch center 35.234°n 53.921°e﻿  35.234 53.921﻿ iranian space agency satellite launch center semnan in semnan the facility includes an underground command and control center a tracking station and a launchpad among other structures
in december 2010 it was announced that due to geographical limitations of first space center in injecting satellite into orbit studies have been carried out for setting up a second satellite launch pad the new national spaceport of iran named after imam khomeini is being built in semnan this new port is to be used to launch all future iranian space missions similar to american kennedy space center or the baikonur cosmodrome in march 2011 janes information group reported on the basis of its satellite imagery analysis of iranian space launch sites that iran is aggressively building complex facilities with very rapid pace showing the nations inclinations towards space readinessin june 2013 iran inaugurated its first space monitoring center located near delijan in markazi province according to irans defense minister general ahmad vahidi the new center which was named imam jafar sadeq would mostly be used to track and detect space objects and satellites passing overhead using radar electro-optic and radio systems


 space test laboratory 

in 2011 iran launched a number of laboratories for testing “space structures and systems” in line with its progressing space program the laboratory includes ten labs to “reinforce infrastructures of irans space industry” and help improve the abilities of human resources


 manned space program 

iran expressed for the first time its intention to send a human to space during the summit of soviet and iranian presidents at 21 june 1990 soviet president mikhail gorbachev reached an agreement in principle with then-president akbar hashemi rafsanjani to make joint soviet-iranian manned flights to mir space station but this agreement was never realized after the breakup of the soviet union
almost two decades later the iranian news agency claimed on 21 november 2005 that the iranians have a manned space program along with plans for the development of a spacecraft and a space laboratory iran aerospace industries organization iaio head reza taghipour on 20 august 2008 revealed iran intends to launch a manned mission into space within a decade this goal was described as the countrys top priority for the next 10 years in order to make iran the leading space power of the region by 2021in august 2010 president ahmadinejad announced that irans first astronaut should be sent into space on board an iranian spacecraft by no later than 2019 later on in december 2010 iranian communications and information technology minister reza taghipour stated that “the initial steps for the plan have been taken and the study phase on the definition of subsystems sub-projects costs and what projects need to be developed toward that end has been conducted which needs to be submitted to the supreme council on space” according to iranian manned space program the first sub-orbital spaceflight was take place by 2016 at an altitude below 200 kilometers as preparation for the eventual orbital spaceflight  no such vehicle was developed
on 17 february 2015 iran unveiled a mock prototype of iranian manned spaceship that would capable of taking astronauts into space according to irans space administrator this program was put on hold in 2017 indefinitely


 space station 
according to unofficial chinese internet sources an iranian participation in the future chinese space station program has been discussed this involvement might range from simply sending astronauts to the 60 tons class space station to contributing with development of a space laboratory module international manned space cooperation has officially been disclosed for the first time after the launch of the chinese shenzhou 7 spacecraft


 lunar program 
western media has quoted that iran has plans to land an astronaut on the moon by 2025 currently iran doesnt have a medium lift rocket therefore as of now iran sending a human to space is unlikely due to the lack of equipment 


 controversy 

the iranian space program has been condemned by united states and europe because of their concern over its military potential some analysts have compared the relatively fast iranian advancement in space technology to russias sputnik program with the prediction that this advancement will propel irans military capability in other areas as well the recent launches of the iranian space program has put its rocket technology ahead of north koreas especially in multi-stage technologies necessary for orbital launch the military concerns over irans space program has been exacerbated over safir rockets advanced 2nd stage which iran has kept secret by not releasing any technical information related to the second stage of the rocket keeping outside observers guessing over the technicalities
