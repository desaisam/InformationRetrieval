the space research and technology institute bulgarian институт за космически изследвания и технологии institut za kosmicheski izsledvaniya i tekhnologii of the bulgarian academy of sciences is one of the primary research bodies in the field of space science in bulgaria the mission of srti-bas is to conduct fundamental and applied studies in the field of space physics remote sensing of the earth and planets and aerospace systems and technologies


 scope 
the field of activity of srti ranges over fundamental and applied investigations in space physics astrophysics image processing remote sensing life sciences scientific equipment preparation and implementation of experiments in the area of space exploration and usage from the board of automatic and piloted spacecraft investigation on control systems air- and spacecraft and equipment for them activity for creation of cosmic materials and technologies and their transfer in the national economy education of post-graduate students and masters degrees


 history 
the organized participation of bulgarian scientists in space research started in 1969 with the creation of a scientific group of space physics sgsp at the presidium of the bulgarian academy of sciences in 1974 based on the sgsp the central laboratory for space research clsr was founded the space research institute sri at the bulgarian academy of sciences succeeded the central laboratory for space research in 1987 under the reform carried out at the bulgarian academy of sciences by a resolution of the general assembly of the bas of 23 march 2010 the sri and the solar-terrestrial influences institute stii merged to form a new unit – the space and solar-terrestrial research institute at the bas sstri–bas renamed in 2012 to space research and technology institute srtibulgarian scientists from srti-bas successfully participated in the intercosmos program preparing experiments and designing equipment for several satellites and rockets
in 1979 the first bulgarian cosmonaut georgi ivanov flew in space on board of soyuz 33
in 1981 two satellites were launched - bulgaria 1300 and meteor-priroda 2-4 meteor 1-31 furnished entirely with bulgarian equipment aimed at studying the ionospheric-magnetospheric relationship and remote sensing of the earth from space
in 1984 teams from srti-bas took part in the international projects vega 1 and 2 1984 – for realization of the project venus-halleys cometin 1988 the second bulgarian cosmonaut alexandar alexsandrov flew on board soyuz tm-5 to the mir space station active 1989 – for determination of the electrostatic field around a satellite the development of apparatus vsk- fregat 1989 – which transmit images of the phobos satellite of mars within the phobos program in the institute was created the space greenhouse svet with which successful experiments were carried out by russian and american astronauts including the cultivation of plants from seed to seed of the space station ss miruntil 2001 on board of the mir ss worked and the system for complex physiological study of astronauts nevrolab-b and r-400 radiometer to obtain data on the parameters of the earths surface
in the recent years the institute is actively included in competitions on the 6th 7th and horizon 2020 framework programmes of the eu phare programme nato etc


 publishing activity 
since 2004 srti-bas is organizing an annual conference space ecology safety which proceedings issn  can be found on the srti-bas website few more workshops and conferences were organized by stil-bas before the reform in 2010 their proceedings can also be found in the publishing activity section of srti-bas website
the aerospace research in bulgaria journal was founded in 1978 under the name space research in bulgaria its founder and first editor was acad kiril serafimov 1978–1990 over the years editors were prof boris bonev 1991–1996 prof nikola georgiev 1996–2006 and prof garo mardirossian 2006–until now the journal has been changing its name two times firstly its was issued under space research in bulgaria issn 0204-9104 no 1–8 from no 9 to no 15 its name was changed to “аерокосмически изследвания в българия” issn 0861-1432 continuing the policy from the first issues to publish in bulgarian russian and english since 2001 the journal name was changed to aerospace research in bulgaria no 16- issn 1313-0927 eissn 2367-9522 and its content is entirely in english with summaries in bulgarian or russian
