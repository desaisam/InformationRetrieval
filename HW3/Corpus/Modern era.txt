modern history the modern period or the modern era is the linear global historiographical approach to the time frame after post-classical history modern history can be further broken down into periods

the early modern period began approximately in the early 16th century notable historical milestones included the european renaissance the age of discovery and the protestant reformation
the late modern period began approximately in the mid-18th century notable historical milestones included the american revolution the french revolution the industrial revolution the great divergence and the russian revolution it took all of human history up to 1804 for the worlds population to reach 1 billion the next billion came just over a century later in 1927
contemporary history is the span of historic events from approximately 1945 that are immediately relevant to the present timethis article primarily covers the 1800–1950 time period with a brief summary of 1500–1800 for a more in depth article on modern times before 1800 see early modern period


 terminology and usage 


 pre-modern 

in the pre-modern era many peoples sense of self and purpose was often expressed via a faith in some form of deity be it that in a single god or in many gods pre-modern cultures have not been thought of creating a sense of distinct individuality though religious officials who often held positions of power were the spiritual intermediaries to the common person it was only through these intermediaries that the general masses had access to the divine tradition was sacred to ancient cultures and was unchanging and the social order of ceremony and morals in a culture could be strictly enforced


 modern 
the term modern was coined in the 16th century to indicate present or recent times ultimately derived from the latin adverb modo meaning just now the european renaissance c 1420–1630 which marked the transition between the late middle ages and early modern times started in italy and was spurred in part by the rediscovery of classical art and literature as well as the new perspectives gained from the age of discovery and the invention of the telescope and microscope expanding the borders of thought and knowledge
in contrast to the pre-modern era western civilization made a gradual transition from pre-modernity to modernity when scientific methods were developed which led many to believe that the use of science would lead to all knowledge thus throwing back the shroud of myth under which pre-modern peoples lived new information about the world was discovered via empirical observation versus the historic use of reason and innate knowledge
the term early modern was introduced in the english language in the 1930s to distinguish the time between what has been called the middle ages and time of the late enlightenment 1800 when the meaning of the term modern ages was developing its contemporary form it is important to note that these terms stem from european history in usage in other parts of the world such as in asia and in muslim countries the terms are applied in a very different way but often in the context with their contact with european culture in the age of discovery


 contemporary 

in the contemporary era there were various socio-technological trends regarding the 21st century and the late modern world the information age and computers were forefront in use not completely ubiquitous but often present in everyday life the development of eastern powers was of note with china and india becoming more powerful in the eurasian theater the european union and russian federation were two forces recently developed a concern for western world if not the whole world was the late modern form of terrorism and the warfare that has resulted from the contemporary terrorist acts


 modern era 


 significant developments 
the modern period has been a period of significant development in the fields of science politics warfare and technology it has also been an age of discovery and globalization during this time the european powers and later their colonies began a political economic and cultural colonization of the rest of the world
by the late 19th and 20th centuries modernist art politics science and culture has come to dominate not only western europe and north america but almost every civilized area on the globe including movements thought of as opposed to the west and globalization the modern era is closely associated with the development of individualism capitalism urbanization and a belief in the possibilities of technological and political progresswars and other perceived problems of this era many of which come from the effects of rapid change and the connected loss of strength of traditional religious and ethical norms have led to many reactions against modern development optimism and belief in constant progress has been most recently criticized by postmodernism while the dominance of western europe and anglo-america over other continents has been criticized by postcolonial theory
one common conception of modernity is the condition of western history since the mid-15th century or roughly the european development of movable type and the printing press in this context the modern society is said to develop over many periods and to be influenced by important events that represent breaks in the continuity

 early modern period 

historians consider the early modern period to be approximately between 1500 and 1800 it follows the late middle ages and is marked by the first european colonies the rise of strong centralized governments and the beginnings of recognizable nation-states that are the direct antecedents of todays states
the expansion of islam took place in north and east africa in west africa various native nations existed the indian empires and civilizations of southeast asia were a vital link in the spice trade on the indian subcontinent the mughal empire existed the archipelagic empires the sultanate of malacca and later the sultanate of johor controlled the southern areas
various chinese dynasties and japanese shogunates controlled the asian sphere in japan the edo period from 1600 to 1868 is also referred to as the early modern period in korea the early modern period is considered to have lasted from the rise of the joseon dynasty to the enthronement of king gojong in the americas pre-columbian peoples had built a large and varied civilization including the aztec empire and alliance the inca civilization the mayan empire and cities and the chibcha in the west kingdoms of europe moved in the direction of reformation and expansion russia reached the pacific coast in 1647 and consolidated its control over the russian far east in the 19th century
later religious trends of the period saw the end of the aforementioned muslim expansion christians and christendom saw the end of the crusades and of religious unity under the roman catholic church it was during this time that the inquisitions and the protestant reformation took place

during the early modern period an age of discovery and trade was undertaken by the western european nations portugal spain the netherlands the united kingdom and france went on a colonial expansion and took possession of lands and set up colonies in africa southern asia and north and south america turkey colonized southeastern europe and parts of the west asia and north africa russia took possession in eastern europe asia and north america


 asia 


 china 

in china urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex large urban centers such as nanjing and beijing also contributed to the growth of private industry in particular small-scale industries grew up often specializing in paper silk cotton and porcelain goods for the most part however  relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country town markets mainly traded food with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil despite the xenophobia and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of neo-confucianism china under the later ming dynasty became isolated prohibiting the construction of ocean going sea vessels despite isolationist policies the ming economy still suffered from an inflation due to an overabundance of spanish new world silver entering its economy through new european colonies such as macao ming china was further strained by victorious but costly wars to protect korea from japanese invasionthe qing dynasty 1644–1912 was founded after the fall of the ming the last han chinese dynasty by the manchus the manchus were formerly known as the jurchens when beijing was captured by li zichengs peasant rebels in 1644 the chongzhen emperor the last ming emperor committed suicide the manchus then allied with former ming general wu sangui and seized control of beijing which became the new capital of the qing dynasty the manchus adopted the confucian norms of traditional chinese government in their rule of china proper schoppa the editor of the columbia guide to modern chinese history argues a date around 1780 as the beginning of modern china is thus closer to what we know today as historical reality it also allows us to have a better baseline to understand the precipitous decline of the chinese polity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries


 japan 

in pre-modern japan following the sengoku period of warring states central government had been largely reestablished by oda nobunaga and toyotomi hideyoshi during the azuchi–momoyama period after the battle of sekigahara in 1600 central authority fell to tokugawa ieyasu who completed this process and received the title of shōgun in 1603
society in the japanese tokugawa period edo society unlike the shogunates before it was based on the strict class hierarchy originally established by toyotomi hideyoshi the daimyōs feudal lords were at the top followed by the warrior-caste of samurai with the farmers artisans and traders ranking below the country was strictly closed to foreigners with few exceptions with the sakoku policy literacy among the japanese people rose in the two centuries of isolationin some parts of the country particularly smaller regions daimyōs and samurai were more or less identical since daimyōs might be trained as samurai and samurai might act as local lords otherwise the largely inflexible nature of this social stratification system unleashed disruptive forces over time taxes on the peasantry were set at fixed amounts which did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value as a result the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time this often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants none however proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers


 india 

on the indian subcontinent the mughal empire ruled most of india in the early 18th century the classic period ended with the death and defeat of emperor aurangzeb in 1707 by the rising hindu maratha empire although the dynasty continued for another 150 years during this period the empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions all the significant monuments of the mughals their most visible legacy date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of persian cultural influence in the indian subcontinent with brilliant literary artistic and architectural results the maratha empire was located in the south west of present-day india and expanded greatly under the rule of the peshwas the prime ministers of the maratha empire in 1761 the maratha army lost the third battle of panipat which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of maratha states


 british and dutch colonization 
the development of new imperialism saw the conquest of nearly all eastern hemisphere territories by colonial powers the commercial colonization of india commenced in 1757 after the battle of plassey when the nawab of bengal surrendered his dominions to the british east india company in 1765 when the company was granted the diwani or the right to collect revenue in bengal and bihar or in 1772 when the company established a capital in calcutta appointed its first governor-general warren hastings and became directly involved in governance

the maratha states following the anglo-maratha wars eventually lost to the british east india company in 1818 with the third anglo-maratha war the rule lasted until 1858 when after the indian rebellion of 1857 and consequent of the government of india act 1858 the british government assumed the task of directly administering india in the new british raj in 1819 stamford raffles established singapore as a key trading post for britain in their rivalry with the dutch however their rivalry cooled in 1824 when an anglo-dutch treaty demarcated their respective interests in southeast asia from the 1850s onwards the pace of colonization shifted to a significantly higher gear
the dutch east india company 1800 and british east india company 1858 were dissolved by their respective governments who took over the direct administration of the colonies only thailand was spared the experience of foreign rule although thailand itself was also greatly affected by the power politics of the western powers colonial rule had a profound effect on southeast asia while the colonial powers profited much from the regions vast resources and large market colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent


 europe 

many major events caused europe to change around the start of the 16th century starting with the fall of constantinople in 1453 the fall of muslim spain and the discovery of the americas in 1492 and martin luthers protestant reformation in 1517 in england the modern period is often dated to the start of the tudor period with the victory of henry vii over richard iii at the battle of bosworth in 1485 early modern european history is usually seen to span from the start of the 15th century through the age of enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries until the beginning of the industrial revolution in the late 18th century


 tsardom of russia 

russia experienced territorial growth through the 17th century which was the age of cossacks cossacks were warriors organized into military communities resembling pirates and pioneers of the new world the native land of the cossacks is defined by a line of russianruthenian town-fortresses located on the border with the steppe and stretching from the middle volga to ryazan and tula then breaking abruptly to the south and extending to the dnieper via pereyaslavl this area was settled by a population of free people practicing various trades and crafts

in 1648 the peasants of ukraine joined the zaporozhian cossacks in rebellion against poland-lithuania during the khmelnytsky uprising because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under polish rule in 1654 the ukrainian leader bohdan khmelnytsky offered to place ukraine under the protection of the russian tsar aleksey i alekseys acceptance of this offer led to another russo-polish war 1654–1667 finally ukraine was split along the river dnieper leaving the western part or right-bank ukraine under polish rule and eastern part left-bank ukraine and kiev under russian later in 1670–71 the don cossacks led by stenka razin initiated a major uprising in the volga region but the tsars troops were successful in defeating the rebels in the east the rapid russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of siberia was led mostly by cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory russian explorers pushed eastward primarily along the siberian river routes and by the mid-17th century there were russian settlements in the eastern siberia on the chukchi peninsula along the amur river and on the pacific coast in 1648 the bering strait between asia and north america was passed for the first time by fedot popov and semyon dezhnyov


 reason and enlightenment 

traditionally the european intellectual transformation of and after the renaissance bridged the middle ages and the modern era the age of reason in the western world is generally regarded as being the start of modern philosophy and a departure from the medieval approach especially scholasticism early 17th-century philosophy is often called the age of rationalism and is considered to succeed renaissance philosophy and precede the age of enlightenment but some consider it as the earliest part of the enlightenment era in philosophy extending that era to two centuries the 18th century saw the beginning of secularization in europe rising to notability in the wake of the french revolution
the age of enlightenment is a time in western philosophy and cultural life centered upon the 18th century in which reason was advocated as the primary source and legitimacy for authority enlightenment gained momentum more or less simultaneously in many parts of europe and america developing during the enlightenment era renaissance humanism as an intellectual movement spread across europe the basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write typically in the form of a letter the term umanista comes from the latter part of the 15th century the people were associated with the studia humanitatis a novel curriculum that was competing with the quadrivium and scholastic logic
renaissance humanism took a close study of the latin and greek classical texts and was antagonistic to the values of scholasticism with its emphasis on the accumulated commentaries and humanists were involved in the sciences philosophies arts and poetry of classical antiquity they self-consciously imitated classical latin and deprecated the use of medieval latin by analogy with the perceived decline of latin they applied the principle of ad fontes or back to the sources across broad areas of learningthe quarrel of the ancients and the moderns was a literary and artistic quarrel that heated up in the early 1690s and shook the académie française the opposing two sides were the ancients anciens who constrain choice of subjects to those drawn from the literature of antiquity and the moderns modernes who supported the merits of the authors of the century of louis xiv fontenelle quickly followed with his digression sur les anciens et les modernes 1688 in which he took the modern side pressing the argument that modern scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge


 scientific revolution 

the scientific revolution was a period when european ideas in classical physics astronomy biology human anatomy chemistry and other classical sciences were rejected and led to doctrines supplanting those that had prevailed from ancient greece to the middle ages which would lead to a transition to modern science this period saw a fundamental transformation in scientific ideas across physics astronomy and biology in institutions supporting scientific investigation and in the more widely held picture of the universe individuals started to question all manners of things and it was this questioning that led to the scientific revolution which in turn formed the foundations of contemporary sciences and the establishment of several modern scientific fields


 the french revolutions 

toward the middle and latter stages of the age of revolution the french political and social revolutions and radical change saw the french governmental structure previously an absolute monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and catholic clergy transform changing to forms based on enlightenment principles of citizenship and inalienable rights the first revolution led to government by the national assembly the second by the legislative assembly and the third by the directory
the changes were accompanied by violent turmoil which included the trial and execution of the king vast bloodshed and repression during the reign of terror and warfare involving every other major european power subsequent events that can be traced to the revolution include the napoleonic wars two separate restorations of the monarchy and two additional revolutions as modern france took shape in the following century france would be governed at one point or another as a republic constitutional monarchy and two different empires


 national and legislative assembly 

during the french revolution the national assembly which existed from june 17 to july 9 of 1789 was a transitional body between the estates-general and the national constituent assembly
the legislative assembly was the legislature of france from october 1 1791 to september 1792 it provided the focus of political debate and revolutionary law-making between the periods of the national constituent assembly and of the national convention


 the directory and napoleonic era 

the executive directory was a body of five directors that held executive power in france following the convention and preceding the consulate the period of this regime 2 november 1795 until 10 november 1799 commonly known as the directory or directoire era constitutes the second to last stage of the french revolution napoleon before seizing the title of emperor was elected as first consul of the consulate of france
the campaigns of french emperor and general napoleon bonaparte characterized the napoleonic era born on corsica as the french invaded and dying suspiciously on the tiny british island of st helena this brilliant commander controlled a french empire that at its height ruled a large portion of europe directly from paris while many of his friends and family ruled countries such as spain poland several parts of italy and many other kingdoms republics and dependencies the napoleonic era changed the face of europe forever and old empires and kingdoms fell apart as a result of the mighty and glorious surge of republicanism


 italian unification 

italian unification was the political and social movement that annexed different states of the italian peninsula into the single state of italy in the 19th century there is a lack of consensus on the exact dates for the beginning and the end of this period but many scholars agree that the process began with the end of napoleonic rule and the congress of vienna in 1815 and approximately ended with the franco-prussian war in 1871 though the last città irredente did not join the kingdom of italy until after world war i


 end of the early modern period 
toward the end of the early modern period europe was dominated by the evolving system of mercantile capitalism in its trade and the new economy european states and politics had the characteristic of absolutism the french power and english revolutions dominated the political scene there eventually evolved an international balance of power that held at bay a great conflagration until years later
the end date of the early modern period is usually associated with the industrial revolution which began in britain in about 1750 another significant date is 1789 the beginning of the french revolution which drastically transformed the state of european politics and ushered in the prince edward era and modern europe


 north america 

the french and indian wars were a series of conflicts in north america that represented the actions there that accompanied the european dynastic wars in quebec the wars are generally referred to as the intercolonial wars while some conflicts involved spanish and dutch forces all pitted great britain its colonies and american indian allies on one side and france its colonies and indian allies on the other
the expanding french and british colonies were contending for control of the western or interior territories whenever the european countries went to war there were actions within and by these colonies although the dates of the conflict did not necessarily exactly coincide with those of the larger conflicts
beginning the age of revolution the american revolution and the ensuing political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century saw the thirteen colonies of north america overthrow the governance of the parliament of great britain and then reject the british monarchy itself to become the sovereign united states of america in this period the colonies first rejected the authority of the parliament to govern them without representation and formed self-governing independent states the second continental congress then joined together against the british to defend that self-governance in the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the american revolutionary war also called american war of independence

the american revolution began with fighting at lexington and concord on july 4 1776 they issued the declaration of independence which proclaimed their independence from great britain and their formation of a cooperative union in june 1776 benjamin franklin was appointed a member of the committee of five that drafted the declaration of independence although he was temporarily disabled by gout and unable to attend most meetings of the committee franklin made several small changes to the draft sent to him by thomas jefferson
the rebellious states defeated great britain in the american revolutionary war the first successful colonial war of independence while the states had already rejected the governance of parliament through the declaration the new united states now rejected the legitimacy of the monarchy to demand allegiance the war raged for seven years with effective american victory followed by formal british abandonment of any claim to the united states with the treaty of paris
the philadelphia convention set up the current united states the united states constitution ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic with a limited central government the bill of rights comprising ten constitutional amendments guaranteeing many fundamental civil rights and freedoms was ratified in 1791


 decolonization of north and south americas 
the decolonization of the americas was the process by which the countries in the americas gained their independence from european rule decolonization began with a series of revolutions in the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries the spanish american wars of independence were the numerous wars against spanish rule in spanish america that took place during the early 19th century from 1808 until 1829 directly related to the napoleonic french invasion of spain the conflict started with short-lived governing juntas established in chuquisaca and quito opposing the composition of the supreme central junta of seville
when the central junta fell to the french numerous new juntas appeared all across the americas eventually resulting in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from argentina and chile in the south to mexico in the north after the death of the king ferdinand vii in 1833 only cuba and puerto rico remained under spanish rule until the spanish–american war in 1898 unlike the spanish the portuguese did not divide their colonial territory in america the captaincies they created were subdued to a centralized administration in salvador later relocated to rio de janeiro which reported directly to the portuguese crown until its independence in 1822 becoming the empire of brazil

 industrial revolutions 

the development of the steam engine started the industrial revolution in great britain the steam engine was created to pump water from coal mines enabling them to be deepened beyond groundwater levels the date of the industrial revolution is not exact eric hobsbawm held that it broke out in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s while ts ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830 in effect the reigns of george iii the regency and george iv the great changes of centuries before the 19th were more connected with ideas religion or military conquest and technological advance had only made small changes in the material wealth of ordinary people
the first industrial revolution merged into the second industrial revolution around 1850 when technological and economic progress gained momentum with the development of steam-powered ships and railways and later in the 19th century with the internal combustion engine and electric power generation the second industrial revolution was a phase of the industrial revolution labeled as the separate technical revolution from a technological and a social point of view there is no clean break between the two major innovations during the period occurred in the chemical electrical petroleum and steel industries specific advancements included the introduction of oil fired steam turbine and internal combustion driven steel ships the development of the airplane the practical commercialization of the automobile mass production of consumer goods the perfection of canning mechanical refrigeration and other food preservation techniques and the invention of the telephone


 industrialization 
industrialization is the process of social and economic change whereby a human group is transformed from a pre-industrial society into an industrial one it is a subdivision of a more general modernization process where social change and economic development are closely related with technological innovation particularly with the development of large-scale energy and metallurgy production it is the extensive organization of an economy for the purpose of manufacturing industrialization also introduces a form of philosophical change where people obtain a different attitude towards their perception of nature


 revolution in manufacture and power 

an economy based on manual labour was replaced by one dominated by industry and the manufacture of machinery it began with the mechanization of the textile industries and the development of iron-making techniques and trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of canals improved roads and then railways
the introduction of steam power fuelled primarily by coal and powered machinery mainly in textile manufacturing underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity the development of all-metal machine tools in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries
the modern petroleum industry started in 1846 with the discovery of the process of refining kerosene from coal by nova scotian abraham pineo gesner ignacy łukasiewicz improved gesners method to develop a means of refining kerosene from the more readily available rock oil petr-oleum seeps in 1852 and the first rock oil mine was built in bóbrka near krosno in galicia in the following year in 1854 benjamin silliman a science professor at yale university in new haven was the first to fractionate petroleum by distillation these discoveries rapidly spread around the world


 notable engineers 

engineering achievements of the revolution ranged from electrification to developments in materials science the advancements made a great contribution to the quality of life in the first revolution lewis paul was the original inventor of roller spinning the basis of the water frame for spinning cotton in a cotton mill matthew boulton and james watts improvements to the steam engine were fundamental to the changes brought by the industrial revolution in both the kingdom of great britain and the world
in the latter part of the second revolution thomas alva edison developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world and is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory in 1882 edison switched on the worlds first large-scale electrical supply network that provided 110 volts direct current to fifty-nine customers in lower manhattan also toward the end of the second industrial revolution nikola tesla made many contributions in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries


 social effects and classes 
the industrial revolutions were major technological socioeconomic and cultural changes in late 18th and early 19th centuries that began in britain and spread throughout the world the effects spread throughout western europe and north america during the 19th century eventually affecting the majority of the world the impact of this change on society was enormous and is often compared to the neolithic revolution when mankind developed agriculture and gave up its nomadic lifestyleit has been argued that gdp per capita was much more stable and progressed at a much slower rate until the industrial revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy and that it has since increased rapidly in capitalist countries


 mid-19th-century european revolts 

the european revolutions of 1848 known in some countries as the spring of nations or the year of revolution were a series of political upheavals throughout the european continent described as a revolutionary wave the period of unrest began in france and then further propelled by the french revolution of 1848 soon spread to the rest of europe although most of the revolutions were quickly put down there was a significant amount of violence in many areas with tens of thousands of people tortured and killed while the immediate political effects of the revolutions were reversed the long-term reverberations of the events were far-reaching


 industrial age reformism 
industrial age reform movements began the gradual change of society rather than with episodes of rapid fundamental changes the reformists ideas were often grounded in liberalism although they also possessed aspects of utopian socialist or religious concepts the radical movement campaigned for electoral reform a reform of the poor laws free trade educational reform postal reform prison reform and public sanitation
following the enlightenments ideas the reformers looked to the scientific revolution and industrial progress to solve the social problems which arose with the industrial revolution newtons natural philosophy combined a mathematics of axiomatic proof with the mechanics of physical observation yielding a coherent system of verifiable predictions and replacing a previous reliance on revelation and inspired truth applied to public life this approach yielded several successful campaigns for changes in social policy

under peter the great russia was proclaimed an empire in 1721 and became recognized as a world power ruling from 1682 to 1725 peter defeated sweden in the great northern war forcing it to cede west karelia and ingria two regions lost by russia in the time of troubles as well as estland and livland securing russias access to the sea and sea trade on the baltic sea peter founded a new capital called saint petersburg later known as russias window to europe peter the greats reforms brought considerable western european cultural influences to russia catherine ii the great who ruled in 1762–96 extended russian political control over the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into russia during the partitions of poland pushing the russian frontier westward and southward  russia would colonize the vast asian lands of siberia expanding by land to the pacific coast of asia and north america  as the large realm embraced absolute monarchy russia remained more conservative than its western neighbors in the 19th century russia was invaded by france in 1812 but emerged as a more powerful superpower afterwards nonetheless industrialization did not come to russia until the 1870s the medieval practice of serfdom was abolished in 1861 freeing over thirty million russian peasants a market economy finally emerged in the russian empire however class warfare rose and the nation was vulnerable due to rivalries with the united kingdom the ottoman empire and the japanese empire


 european dominance and the 19th century 

historians define the 19th century historical era as stretching from 1815 the congress of vienna to 1914 the outbreak of the first world war alternatively eric hobsbawm defined the long nineteenth century as spanning the years 1789 to 1914


 imperialism and empires 

in the 1800s and early 1900s once great and powerful empires such as spain ottoman turkey the mughal empire and the kingdom of portugal began to break apart spain which was at one time unrivaled in europe had been declining for a long time when it was crippled by napoleon bonapartes invasion sensing the time was right spains vast colonies in south america began a series of rebellions that ended with almost all of the spanish territories gaining their independence
the once mighty ottoman empire was wracked with a series of revolutions resulting with the ottomans only holding a small region that surrounded the capital istanbul

the mughal empire which was descended from the mongol khanate was bested by the upcoming maratha confederacy all was going well for the marathas until the british took an interest in the riches of india and the british ended up ruling not just the boundaries of modern india but also pakistan burma nepal bangladesh and some southern regions of afghanistan
the king of portugals vast territory of brazil reformed into the independent empire of brazil with the defeat of napoleonic france britain became undoubtedly the most powerful country in the world and by the end of the first world war controlled a quarter of the worlds population and a third of its surface however the power of the british empire did not end on land since it had the greatest navy on the planet electricity steel and petroleum enabled germany to become a great international power that raced to create empires of its own
the meiji restoration was a chain of events that led to enormous changes in japans political and social structure that was taking a firm hold at the beginning of the meiji era which coincided the opening of japan by the arrival of the black ships of commodore matthew perry and made imperial japan a great power russia and qing dynasty china failed to keep pace with the other world powers which led to massive social unrest in both empires the qing dynastys military power weakened during the 19th century and faced with international pressure massive rebellions and defeats in wars the dynasty declined after the mid-19th century
european powers controlled parts of oceania with french new caledonia from 1853 and french polynesia from 1889 the germans established colonies in new guinea in 1884 and samoa in 1900 the united states expanded into the pacific with hawaii becoming a us territory from 1898 disagreements between the us germany and uk over samoa led to the tripartite convention of 1899


 british victorian era 
the victorian era of the united kingdom was the period of queen victorias reign from june 1837 to january 1901 this was a long period of prosperity for the british people as profits gained from the overseas british empire as well as from industrial improvements at home allowed a large educated middle class to develop some scholars would extend the beginning of the period—as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political games that have come to be associated with the victorians—back five years to the passage of the reform act 1832

in britains imperial century victory over napoleon left britain without any serious international rival other than russia in central asia unchallenged at sea britain adopted the role of global policeman a state of affairs later known as the pax britannica and a foreign policy of splendid isolation alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies britains dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many nominally independent countries such as china argentina and siam which has been generally characterized as informal empire of note during this time was the anglo-zulu war which was fought in 1879 between the british empire and the zulu empire
british imperial strength was underpinned by the steamship and the telegraph new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century allowing it to control and defend the empire by 1902 the british empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables the so-called all red line growing until 1922 around 13,000,000 square miles 34,000,000 km2 of territory and roughly 458 million people were added to the british empire the british established colonies in australia in 1788 new zealand in 1840 and fiji in 1872 with much of oceania becoming part of the british empire


 french governments and conflicts 
the bourbon restoration followed the ousting of napoleon i of france in 1814 the allies restored the bourbon dynasty to the french throne the ensuing period is called the restoration following french usage and is characterized by a sharp conservative reaction and the re-establishment of the roman catholic church as a power in french politics the july monarchy was a period of liberal constitutional monarchy in france under king louis-philippe starting with the july revolution or three glorious days of 1830 and ending with the revolution of 1848 the second empire was the imperial bonapartist regime of napoleon iii from 1852 to 1870 between the second republic and the third republic in france

the franco-prussian war was a conflict between france and prussia while prussia was backed up by the north german confederation of which it was a member and the south german states of baden württemberg and bavaria the complete prussian and german victory brought about the final unification of germany under king wilhelm i of prussia it also marked the downfall of napoleon iii and the end of the second french empire which was replaced by the third republic as part of the settlement almost all of the territory of alsace-lorraine was taken by prussia to become a part of germany which it would retain until the end of world war i
the french third republic was the republican government of france between the end of the second french empire following the defeat of louis-napoléon in the franco-prussian war in 1870 and the vichy regime after the invasion of france by the german third reich in 1940 the third republic endured seventy years making it the most long-lasting regime in france since the collapse of the ancien régime in the french revolution of 1789


 slavery and abolition 

slavery was greatly reduced around the world in the 19th century following a successful slave revolt in haiti britain forced the barbary pirates to halt their practice of kidnapping and enslaving europeans banned slavery throughout its domain and charged its navy with ending the global slave trade slavery was then abolished in russia america and brazil


 african colonization 

following the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 and propelled by economic exploitation the scramble for africa was initiated formally at the berlin west africa conference in 1884–1885 the berlin conference attempted to avoid war among the european powers by allowing the european rival countries to carve up the continent of africa into national colonies africans were not consulted
the major european powers laid claim to the areas of africa where they could exhibit a sphere of influence over the area these claims did not have to have any substantial land holdings or treaties to be legitimate the european power that demonstrated its control over a territory accepted the mandate to rule that region as a national colony the european nation that held the claim developed and benefited from their colonys commercial interests without having to fear rival european competition with the colonial claim came the underlying assumption that the european power that exerted control would use its mandate to offer protection and provide welfare for its colonial peoples however this principle remained more theory than practice there were many documented instances of material and moral conditions deteriorating for native africans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries under european colonial rule to the point where the colonial experience for them has been described as hell on earth

at the time of the berlin conference africa contained one-fifth of the worlds population living in one-quarter of the worlds land area however from europes perspective they were dividing an unknown continent european countries established a few coastal colonies in africa by the mid-nineteenth century which included cape colony great britain angola portugal and algeria france but until the late nineteenth century europe largely traded with free african states without feeling the need for territorial possession until the 1880s most of africa remained uncharted with western maps from the period generally showing blank spaces for the continents interior
from the 1880s to 1914 the european powers expanded their control across the african continent competing with each other for africas land and resources great britain controlled various colonial holdings in east africa that spanned the length of the african continent from egypt in the north to south africa the french gained major ground in west africa and the portuguese held colonies in southern africa germany italy and spain established a small number of colonies at various points throughout the continent which included german east africa tanganyika and german southwest africa for germany eritrea and libya for italy and the canary islands and rio de oro in northwestern africa for spain finally for king leopold ruled from 1865 to 1909 there was the large “piece of that great african cake” known as the congo which became his personal fiefdom by 1914 almost the entire continent was under european control liberia which was settled by freed american slaves in the 1820s and abyssinia ethiopia in eastern africa were the last remaining independent african states


 meiji japan 

 around the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century the meiji era occurred during the reign of the meiji emperor during this time japan started its modernization and rose to world power status this era name means enlightened rule in japan the meiji restoration started in the 1860s marking the rapid modernization by the japanese themselves along european lines much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous tokugawa period it was not until the beginning of the meiji era that the japanese government began taking modernization seriously japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations the hyobusho war office was replaced with a war department and a naval department the samurai class suffered great disappointment the following years
laws were instituted that required every able-bodied male japanese citizen regardless of class to serve a mandatory term of three years with the first reserves and two additional years with the second reserves this action the deathblow for the samurai warriors and their daimyōs initially met resistance from both the peasant and warrior alike the peasant class interpreted the term for military service ketsu-eki blood tax literally and attempted to avoid service by any means necessary the japanese government began modelling their ground forces after the french military the french government contributed greatly to the training of japanese officers many were employed at the military academy in kyoto and many more still were feverishly translating french field manuals for use in the japanese ranks japans modernized military gave japan the opportunity to engage in imperialism with its victory against the qing empire in the first sino-japanese war japan annexed taiwan korea and the chinese province of shangdong
after the death of the meiji emperor the taishō emperor took the throne the taishō period was a time of democratic reform granting democratic rights to all japanese men foreigners would instrumental in aiding in japans modernization  a key foreign observer of the remarkable and rapid changes in japanese society in this period was ernest mason satow


 united states 


 antebellum expansion 

the antebellum age was a period of increasing division in the country based on the growth of slavery in the american south and in the western territories of kansas and nebraska that eventually led to the civil war in 1861 the antebellum period is often considered to have begun with the kansas–nebraska act of 1854 although it may have begun as early as 1812 this period is also significant because it marked the transition of american manufacturing to the industrial revolutionmanifest destiny was the belief that the united states was destined to expand across the north american continent from the atlantic seaboard to the pacific ocean during this time the united states expanded to the pacific ocean—from sea to shining sea—largely defining the borders of the contiguous united states as they are today


 civil war and reconstruction 

the american civil war began when seven southern slave states declared their secession from the us and formed the confederate states of america the confederacy four more states joinged the confederacy later led by jefferson davis they fought against the us federal government the union under president abraham lincoln which was supported by all the free states and the five border slave states in the north
northern leaders agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting secession and confederate nationalism had to be totally repudiated and all forms of slavery or quasi-slavery had to be eliminated lincoln proved effective in mobilizing support for the war goals raising large armies and supplying them avoiding foreign interference and making the end of slavery a war goal the confederacy had a larger area than it could defend and it failed to keep its ports open and its rivers clear as was the case in the battle of vickysburg the north kept up the pressure as the south could barely feed and clothe its soldiers its soldiers especially those in the east under the command of general robert e lee proved highly resourceful until they finally were overwhelmed by generals ulysses s grant and william t sherman in 1864–65 the reconstruction era 1863–77 began with the emancipation proclamation in 1863 and included freedom full citizenship and voting rights for southern blacks it was followed by a reaction that left the blacks in a second class status legally politically socially and economically until the 1960s


 the gilded age and legacy 

during the gilded age there was substantial growth in population in the united states and extravagant displays of wealth and excess of americas upper-class during the post-civil war and post-reconstruction era in the late 19th century the wealth polarization derived primarily from industrial and population expansion the businessmen of the second industrial revolution created industrial towns and cities in the northeast with new factories and contributed to the creation of an ethnically diverse industrial working class which produced the wealth owned by rising super-rich industrialists and financiers called the robber barons an example is the company of john d rockefeller who was an important figure in shaping the new oil industry using highly effective tactics and aggressive practices later widely criticized standard oil absorbed or destroyed most of its competition
the creation of a modern industrial economy took place with the creation of a transportation and communication infrastructure the corporation became the dominant form of business organization and a managerial revolution transformed business operations in 1890 congress passed the sherman antitrust act—the source of all american anti-monopoly laws the law forbade every contract scheme deal or conspiracy to restrain trade though the phrase restraint of trade remained subjective by the beginning of the 20th century per capita income and industrial production in the united states exceeded that of any other country except britain long hours and hazardous working conditions led many workers to attempt to form labor unions despite strong opposition from industrialists and the courts but the courts did protect the marketplace declaring the standard oil group to be an unreasonable monopoly under the sherman antitrust act in 1911 it ordered standard to break up into 34 independent companies with different boards of directors


 science and philosophy 

replacing the classical physics in use since the end of the scientific revolution modern physics arose in the early 20th century with the advent of quantum physics substituting mathematical studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure the old quantum theory was a collection of results which predate modern quantum mechanics but were never complete or self-consistent the collection of heuristic prescriptions for quantum mechanics were the first corrections to classical mechanics outside the realm of quantum physics the various aether theories in classical physics which supposed a fifth element such as the luminiferous aether were nullified by the michelson–morley experiment—an attempt to detect the motion of earth through the aether in biology darwinism gained acceptance promoting the concept of adaptation in the theory of natural selection the fields of geology astronomy and psychology also made strides and gained new insights in medicine there were advances in medical theory and treatments
starting one-hundred years before the 20th century the enlightenment spiritual philosophy was challenged in various quarters around the 1900s developed from earlier secular traditions modern humanist ethical philosophies affirmed the dignity and worth of all people based on the ability to determine right and wrong by appealing to universal human qualities particularly rationality without resorting to the supernatural or alleged divine authority from religious texts for liberal humanists such as rousseau and kant the universal law of reason guided the way toward total emancipation from any kind of tyranny these ideas were challenged for example by the young karl marx who criticized the project of political emancipation embodied in the form of human rights asserting it to be symptomatic of the very dehumanization it was supposed to oppose for friedrich nietzsche humanism was nothing more than a secular version of theism in his genealogy of morals he argues that human rights exist as a means for the weak to collectively constrain the strong on this view such rights do not facilitate emancipation of life but rather deny it in the 20th century the notion that human beings are rationally autonomous was challenged by the concept that humans were driven by unconscious irrational desires


 notable persons 

sigmund freud is renowned for his redefinition of sexual desire as the primary motivational energy of human life as well as his therapeutic techniques including the use of free association his theory of transference in the therapeutic relationship and the interpretation of dreams as sources of insight into unconscious desires
albert einstein is known for his theories of special relativity and general relativity he also made important contributions to statistical mechanics especially his mathematical treatment of brownian motion his resolution of the paradox of specific heats and his connection of fluctuations and dissipation despite his reservations about its interpretation einstein also made contributions to quantum mechanics and indirectly quantum field theory primarily through his theoretical studies of the photon


 social darwinism 
at the end of the 19th century social darwinism was promoted and included the various ideologies based on a concept that competition among all individuals groups nations or ideas was a natural framework for social evolution in human societies in this view societys advancement is dependent on the survival of the fittest the term was in fact coined by herbert spencer and referred to in the gospel of wealth written by andrew carnegie


 marxist society 

karl marx summarized his approach to history and politics in the opening line of the first chapter of the communist manifesto 1848 he wrote

the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class strugglesthe manifesto went through a number of editions from 1872 to 1890 notable new prefaces were written by marx and engels for the 1872 german edition the 1882 russian edition the 1883 german edition and the 1888 english edition in general marxism identified five and one transitional successive stages of development in western europe
primitive communism as seen in cooperative tribal societies
slave society which develops when the tribe becomes a city-state aristocracy is born
feudalism aristocracy is the ruling class merchants develop into capitalists
capitalism capitalists are the ruling class who create and employ the true working class
dictatorship of the proletariat workers gain class consciousness overthrow the capitalists and take control over the state
communism a classless and stateless society


 european decline and the 20th century 

major political developments saw the former british empire lose most of its remaining political power over commonwealth countries the trans-siberian railway crossing asia by train was complete by 1916 other events include the israeli–palestinian conflict two world wars and the cold war


 australian constitution 
in 1901 the federation of australia was the process by which the six separate british self-governing colonies of new south wales queensland south australia tasmania victoria and western australia formed one nation they kept the systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies but also would have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation when the constitution of australia came into force the colonies collectively became states of the commonwealth of australia


 revolution and warlords in china 

the last days of the qing dynasty were marked with civil unrest failed reforms and foreign invasions such as the boxer rebellion responding to these civil failures and discontent the qing imperial court did attempt to reform the government in various ways as the decision to draft a constitution in 1906 the establishment of provincial legislatures in 1909 and the preparation for a national parliament in 1910 however many of these measures were opposed by the conservatives of the qing court and many reformers were either imprisoned or executed outright the failures of the imperial court to enact such reforming measures of political liberalization and modernization caused the reformists to steer toward the road of revolution
the assertions of chinese philosophy began to integrate concepts of western philosophy as steps toward modernization by the time of the xinhai revolution in 1911 there were many calls such as the may fourth movement to completely abolish the old imperial institutions and practices of china there were attempts to incorporate democracy republicanism and industrialism into chinese philosophy notably by sun yat-sen at the beginning of the 20th century
in 1912 the republic of china was established and sun yat-sen was inaugurated in nanjing as the first provisional president but power in beijing already had passed to yuan shikai who had effective control of the beiyang army the most powerful military force in china at the time to prevent civil war and possible foreign intervention from undermining the infant republic leaders agreed to armys demand that china be united under a beijing government on march 10 in beijing shikai was sworn in as the second provisional president of the republic of china
after the early 20th century revolutions shifting alliances of chinas regional warlords waged war for control of the beijing government despite the fact that various warlords gained control of the government in beijing during the warlord era this did not constitute a new era of control or governance because other warlords did not acknowledge the transitory governments in this period and were a law unto themselves these military-dominated governments were collectively known as the beiyang government the warlord era ended around 1927


 world wars era 


 start of the 20th century 

in 1900 the worlds population had approached approximately 1.6 billion
four years into the 20th century saw the russo-japanese war with the battle of port arthur establishing the empire of japan as a world power the russians were in constant pursuit of a warm water port on the pacific ocean for their navy as well as for maritime trade the manchurian campaign of the russian empire was fought against the japanese over manchuria and korea the major theatres of operations were southern manchuria specifically the area around the liaodong peninsula and mukden and the seas around korea japan and the yellow sea the resulting campaigns in which the fledgling japanese military consistently attained victory over the russian forces arrayed against them were unexpected by world observers these victories as time transpired would dramatically transform the distribution of power in east asia resulting in a reassessment of japans recent entry onto the world stage the embarrassing string of defeats increased russian popular dissatisfaction with the inefficient and corrupt tsarist government
the russian revolution of 1905 was a wave of mass political unrest through vast areas of the russian empire some of it was directed against the government while some was undirected  it included terrorism worker strikes peasant unrests and military mutinies it led to the establishment of the limited constitutional monarchy the establishment of state duma of the russian empire and the multi-party system
in china the qing dynasty was overthrown following the xinhai revolution the xinhai revolution began with the wuchang uprising on october 10 1911 and ended with the abdication of emperor puyi on february 12 1912 the primary parties to the conflict were the imperial forces of the qing dynasty 1644–1911 and the revolutionary forces of the chinese revolutionary alliance tongmenghui


 edwardian britain 

the edwardian era in the united kingdom is the period spanning the reign of king edward vii up to the end of the first world war including the years surrounding the sinking of the rms titanic in the early years of the period the second boer war in south africa split the country into anti- and pro-war factions the imperial policies of the conservatives eventually proved unpopular and in the general election of 1906 the liberals won a huge landslide the liberal government was unable to proceed with all of its radical programme without the support of the house of lords which was largely conservative conflict between the two houses of parliament over the peoples budget led to a reduction in the power of the peers in 1910 the general election in january that year returned a hung parliament with the balance of power held by labour and irish nationalist members


 world war i 

the causes of world war i included many factors including the conflicts and antagonisms of the four decades leading up to the war the triple entente was the name given to the loose alignment between the united kingdom france and russia after the signing of the anglo-russian entente in 1907  the alignment of the three powers supplemented by various agreements with japan the united states and spain constituted a powerful counterweight to the triple alliance of germany austria-hungary and italy the third having concluded an additional secret agreement with france effectively nullifying her alliance commitments militarism alliances imperialism and nationalism played major roles in the conflict the immediate origins of the war lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the july crisis of 1914 the spark or casus belli for which was the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand of austria
however the crisis did not exist in a void it came after a long series of diplomatic clashes between the great powers over european and colonial issues in the decade prior to 1914 which had left tensions high the diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in europe since 1870 an example is the baghdad railway which was planned to connect the ottoman empire cities of konya and baghdad with a line through modern-day turkey syria and iraq the railway became a source of international disputes during the years immediately preceding world war i although it has been argued that they were resolved in 1914 before the war began it has also been argued that the railroad was a cause of the first world war fundamentally the war was sparked by tensions over territory in the balkans austria-hungary competed with serbia and russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the great powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties the balkan wars were two wars in south-eastern europe in 1912–1913 in the course of which the balkan league bulgaria montenegro greece and serbia first captured ottoman-held remaining part of thessaly macedonia epirus albania and most of thrace and then fell out over the division of the spoils with incorporation of romania this time

 
the first world war began in 1914 and lasted to the final armistice in 1918 the allied powers led by the british empire france russia until march 1918 japan and the united states after 1917 defeated the central powers led by the german empire austro-hungarian empire and the ottoman empire the war caused the disintegration of four empires—the austro-hungarian german ottoman and russian ones—as well as radical change in the european and west asian maps the allied powers before 1917 are referred to as the triple entente and the central powers are referred to as the triple alliance

much of the fighting in world war i took place along the western front within a system of opposing manned trenches and fortifications separated by a no mans land running from the north sea to the border of switzerland on the eastern front the vast eastern plains and limited rail network prevented a trench warfare stalemate from developing although the scale of the conflict was just as large  hostilities also occurred on and under the sea and—for the first time—from the air more than 9 million soldiers died on the various battlefields and nearly that many more in the participating countries home fronts on account of food shortages and genocide committed under the cover of various civil wars and internal conflicts notably more people died of the worldwide influenza outbreak at the end of the war and shortly after than died in the hostilities the unsanitary conditions engendered by the war severe overcrowding in barracks wartime propaganda interfering with public health warnings and migration of so many soldiers around the world helped the outbreak become a pandemicultimately world war i created a decisive break with the old world order that had emerged after the napoleonic wars which was modified by the mid-19th centurys nationalistic revolutions the results of world war i would be important factors in the development of world war ii approximately 20 years later more immediate to the time the partitioning of the ottoman empire was a political event that redrew the political boundaries of west asia the huge conglomeration of territories and peoples formerly ruled by the sultan of the ottoman empire was divided into several new nations the partitioning brought the creation of the modern arab world and the republic of turkey the league of nations granted france mandates over syria and lebanon and granted the united kingdom mandates over mesopotamia and palestine which was later divided into two regions palestine and transjordan parts of the ottoman empire on the arabian peninsula became parts of what are today saudi arabia and yemen


 revolutions and war in eurasia 

the russian revolution is the series of revolutions in russia in 1917 which destroyed the tsarist autocracy and led to the creation of the soviet union following the abdication of nicholas ii of russia the russian provisional government was established in october 1917 a red faction revolution occurred in which the red guard armed groups of workers and deserting soldiers directed by the bolshevik party seized control of saint petersburg then known as petrograd and began an immediate armed takeover of cities and villages throughout the former russian empire
another action in 1917 that is of note was the armistice signed between russia and the central powers at brest-litovsk as a condition for peace the treaty by the central powers conceded huge portions of the former russian empire to imperial germany and the ottoman empire greatly upsetting nationalists and conservatives the bolsheviks made peace with the german empire and the central powers as they had promised the russian people prior to the revolution vladimir lenins decision has been attributed to his sponsorship by the foreign office of wilhelm ii german emperor offered by the latter in hopes that with a revolution russia would withdraw from world war i this suspicion was bolstered by the german foreign ministrys sponsorship of lenins return to petrograd  the western allies expressed their dismay at the bolsheviks upset at

the withdrawal of russia from the war effort
worried about a possible russo-german alliance and
galvanized by the prospect of the bolsheviks making good their threats to assume no responsibility for and so default on imperial russias massive foreign loans
in addition there was a concern shared by many central powers as well that the socialist revolutionary ideas would spread to the west hence many of these countries expressed their support for the whites including the provision of troops and supplies winston churchill declared that bolshevism must be strangled in its cradlethe russian civil war was a multi-party war that occurred within the former russian empire after the russian provisional government collapsed and the soviets under the domination of the bolshevik party assumed power first in petrograd st petersburg and then in other places in the wake of the october revolution the old russian imperial army had been demobilized the volunteer-based red guard was the bolsheviks main military force augmented by an armed military component of the cheka the bolshevik state security apparatus there was an instituted mandatory conscription of the rural peasantry into the red army opposition of rural russians to red army conscription units was overcome by taking hostages and shooting them when necessary in order to force compliance former tsarist officers were utilized as military specialists voenspetsy taking their families hostage in order to ensure loyalty at the start of the war three-fourths of the red army officer corps was composed of former tsarist officers by its end 83% of all red army divisional and corps commanders were ex-tsarist soldiers

the principal fighting occurred between the bolshevik red army and the forces of the white army many foreign armies warred against the red army notably the allied forces yet many volunteer foreigners fought in both sides of the russian civil war other nationalist and regional political groups also participated in the war including the ukrainian nationalist green army the ukrainian anarchist black army and black guards and warlords such as ungern von sternberg the most intense fighting took place from 1918 to 1920 major military operations ended on 25 october 1922 when the red army occupied vladivostok previously held by the provisional priamur government the last enclave of the white forces was the ayano-maysky district on the pacific coast the majority of the fighting ended in 1920 with the defeat of general pyotr wrangel in the crimea but a notable resistance in certain areas continued until 1923 eg kronstadt uprising tambov rebellion basmachi revolt and the final resistance of the white movement in the far east
while the early 1920s was a time of flux for revolutionary russia and central asia the union of soviet socialist republics was proclaimed in 1922 as the successor state to the fallen russian empire revolutionary leader vladimir lenin died of natural causes and was succeeded by joseph stalin


 the early republic of china 
in 1917 china declared war on germany in the hope of recovering its lost province then under japanese control the new culture movement occupied the period from 1917 to 1923 chinese representatives refused to sign the treaty of versailles due to intense pressure from the student protesters and public opinion alike

the may fourth movement helped to rekindle the then-fading cause of republican revolution in 1917 sun yat-sen had become commander-in-chief of a rival military government in guangzhou in collaboration with southern warlords suns efforts to obtain aid from the western democracies were ignored however and in 1920 he turned to the soviet union which had recently achieved its own revolution the soviets sought to befriend the chinese revolutionists by offering scathing attacks on western imperialism but for political expediency the soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both sun and the newly established chinese communist party ccp
in early 1927 the kuomintang-ccp rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks the ccp and the left wing of the kuomintang had decided to move the seat of the nationalist government from guangzhou to wuhan but chiang kai-shek whose northern expedition was proving successful set his forces to destroying the shanghai ccp apparatus and established an anti-communist government at nanjing in april 1927


 nanjing period in china 
the nanjing decade of 1928–37 was one of consolidation and accomplishment under the leadership of the nationalists with a mixed but generally positive record in the economy social progress development of democracy and cultural creativity some of the harsh aspects of foreign concessions and privileges in china were moderated through diplomacy


 the 1920s and the depression 

the interwar period was the period between the end of the first world war and the beginning of the second world war this period was marked by turmoil in much of the world as europe struggled to recover from the devastation of the first world war in north america especially the first half of this period people experienced considerable prosperity in the roaring twenties the social and societal upheaval known as the roaring twenties began in north america and spread to europe in the aftermath of world war i the roaring twenties often called the jazz age saw an exposition of social artistic and cultural dynamism normalcy returned to politics jazz music blossomed the flapper redefined modern womanhood art deco peaked the spirit of the roaring twenties was marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity a break with traditions everything seemed to be feasible through modern technology new technologies especially automobiles movies and radio proliferated modernity to a large part of the population the 1920s saw the general favor of practicality in architecture as well as in daily life the 1920s was further distinguished by several inventions and discoveries extensive industrial growth and the rise in consumer demand and aspirations and significant changes in lifestyle
europe spent these years rebuilding and coming to terms with the vast human cost of the conflict the economy of the united states became increasingly intertwined with that of europe in germany the weimar republic gave way to episodes of political and economic turmoil which culminated with the german hyperinflation of 1923 and the failed beer hall putsch of that same year when germany could no longer afford war payments wall street invested heavily in european debts to keep the european economy afloat as a large consumer market for american mass-produced goods by the middle of the decade economic development soared in europe and the roaring twenties broke out in germany britain and france the second half of the decade becoming known as the golden twenties in france and francophone canada they were also called the années folles crazy years 1935 german nazis created large public performances to earn public support worldwide prosperity changed dramatically with the onset of the great depression in 1929 the wall street crash of 1929 served to punctuate the end of the previous era as the great depression set in the great depression was a worldwide economic downturn starting in most places in 1929 and ending at different times in the 1930s or early 1940s for different countries it was the largest and most important economic depression in the 20th century and is used in the 21st century as an example of how far the worlds economy can fallthe depression had devastating effects in virtually every country rich or poor international trade plunged by half to two-thirds as did personal income tax revenue prices and profits cities all around the world were hit hard especially those dependent on heavy industry construction was virtually halted in many countries farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by roughly 60 percent facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs areas dependent on primary sector industries suffered the most
the great depression ended at different times in different countries with the effect lasting into the next era americas great depression ended in 1941 with americas entry into world war ii the majority of countries set up relief programs and most underwent some sort of political upheaval pushing them to the left or right in some world states the desperate citizens turned toward nationalist demagogues—the most infamous being adolf hitler—setting the stage for the next era of war the convulsion brought on by the worldwide depression resulted in the rise of nazism in asia japan became an ever more assertive power especially with regards to china


 the league and crises 

the interwar period was also marked by a radical change in the international order away from the balance of power that had dominated pre–world war i europe one main institution that was meant to bring stability was the league of nations which was created after the first world war with the intention of maintaining world security and peace and encouraging economic growth between member countries the league was undermined by the bellicosity of nazi germany imperial japan the soviet union and mussolinis italy and by the non-participation of the united states leading many to question its effectiveness and legitimacya series of international crises strained the league to its limits the earliest being the invasion of manchuria by japan and the abyssinian crisis of 1935/36 in which italy invaded abyssinia one of the only free african nations at that time

the league tried to enforce economic sanctions upon italy but to no avail the incident highlighted french and british weakness exemplified by their reluctance to alienate italy and lose her as their ally the limited actions taken by the western powers pushed mussolinis italy towards alliance with hitlers germany anyway the abyssinian war showed hitler how weak the league was and encouraged the remilitarization of the rhineland in flagrant disregard of the treaty of versailles this was the first in a series of provocative acts culminating in the invasion of poland in september 1939 and the beginning of the second world war
few chinese had any illusions about japanese designs on china hungry for raw materials and pressed by a growing population japan initiated the seizure of manchuria in september 1931 and established ex-qing emperor puyi as head of the puppet state of manchukuo in 1932 during the sino-japanese war 1937–1945 the loss of manchuria and its vast potential for industrial development and war industries was a blow to the kuomintang economy the league of nations established at the end of world war i was unable to act in the face of the japanese defiance after 1940 conflicts between the kuomintang and communists became more frequent in the areas not under japanese control the communists expanded their influence wherever opportunities presented themselves through mass organizations administrative reforms and the land- and tax-reform measures favoring the peasants—while the kuomintang attempted to neutralize the spread of communist influence


 tripartite pact 

the second sino-japanese war had seen tensions rise between imperial japan and the united states events such as the panay incident and the nanking massacre turned american public opinion against japan with the occupation of french indochina in the years of 1940–41 and with the continuing war in china the united states placed embargoes on japan of strategic materials such as scrap metal and oil which were vitally needed for the war effort the japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from china and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich european-controlled colonies of south east asia—specifically british malaya and the dutch east indies modern-day indonesia in 1940 imperial japan signed the tripartite pact with nazi germany and fascist italy


 world war ii 

the second world war was a global military conflict that took place in 1939–1945 it was the largest and deadliest war in history culminating in the holocaust and ending with the dropping of the atom bomb
even though japan had been invading in china since 1937 the conventional view is that the war began on september 1 1939 when nazi germany invaded poland the drang nach osten within two days the united kingdom and france declared war on germany even though the fighting was confined to poland pursuant to a then-secret provision of its non-aggression molotov–ribbentrop pact the soviet union joined with germany on september 17 1939 to conquer poland and to divide eastern europe
the allies were initially made up of poland the united kingdom france australia canada new zealand south africa as well as british commonwealth countries which were controlled directly by the uk such as the indian empire all of these countries declared war on germany in september 1939

following the lull in fighting known as the phoney war germany invaded western europe in may 1940 six weeks later france in the mean time attacked by italy as well surrendered to germany which then tried unsuccessfully to conquer britain on september 27 germany italy and japan signed a mutual defense agreement the tripartite pact and were known as the axis powers nine months later on june 22 1941 germany launched a massive invasion of the soviet union which promptly joined the allies germany was now engaged in fighting a war on two fronts this proved to be a mistake by germany – germany had not successfully carried out the invasion of britain and the war turned against the axis
on december 7 1941 japan attacked the united states at pearl harbor bringing it too into the war on the allied side china also joined the allies as eventually did most of the rest of the world china was in turmoil at the time and attacked japanese armies through guerilla-type warfare by the beginning of 1942 the major combatants were aligned as follows the british commonwealth the united states and the soviet union were fighting germany and italy and the british commonwealth china and the united states were fighting japan the united kingdom the united states the soviet union and china were referred as a trusteeship of the powerful during the world war ii and were recognized as the allied big four in declaration by united nations these four countries were considered as the four policemen or four sheriffs of the allies power and primary victors of world war ii from then through august 1945 battles raged across all of europe in the north atlantic ocean across north africa throughout southeast asia throughout china across the pacific ocean and in the air over japan
italy surrendered in september 1943 and was split into a northern germany-occupied puppet state and an allies-friendly state in the south germany surrendered in may 1945 following the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki japan surrendered marking the end of the war on september 2 1945

it is possible that around 62 million people died in the war estimates vary greatly about 60% of all casualties were civilians who died as a result of disease starvation genocide in particular the holocaust and aerial bombing the former soviet union and china suffered the most casualties estimates place deaths in the soviet union at around 23 million while china suffered about 10 million no country lost a greater portion of its population than poland approximately 5.6 million or 16 of its pre-war population of 34.8 million died
the holocaust which roughly means burnt whole was the deliberate and systematic murder of millions of jews and other unwanted during world war ii by the nazi regime in germany several differing views exist regarding whether it was intended to occur from the wars beginning or if the plans for it came about later regardless persecution of jews extended well before the war even started such as in the kristallnacht night of broken glass the nazis used propaganda to great effect to stir up anti-semitic feelings within ordinary germans
after world war ii europe was informally split into western and soviet spheres of influence western europe later aligned as the north atlantic treaty organization nato and eastern europe as the warsaw pact there was a shift in power from western europe and the british empire to the two new superpowers the united states and the soviet union these two rivals would later face off in the cold war in asia the defeat of japan led to its democratization chinas civil war continued through and after the war resulting eventually in the establishment of the peoples republic of china the former colonies of the european powers began their road to independence


 end of the period – postwar world 

the mid-20th century is distinguished from most of human history in that its most significant changes were directly or indirectly economic and technological in nature economic development was the force behind vast changes in everyday life to a degree which was unprecedented in human history
over the course of the 20th century the worlds per-capita gross domestic product grew by a factor of five much more than all earlier centuries combined including the 19th with its industrial revolution many economists make the case that this understates the magnitude of growth as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of the 20th century such as improved medicine causing world life expectancy to increase by more than two decades and communications technologies were not available at any price at its beginning  however the gulf between the worlds rich and poor grew wider and the majority of the global population remained in the poor side of the dividestill advancing technology and medicine has had a great impact even in the global south large-scale industry and more centralized media made brutal dictatorships possible on an unprecedented scale in the middle of the century leading to wars that were also unprecedented however the increased communications contributed to democratization technological developments included the development of airplanes and space exploration nuclear technology advancement in genetics and the dawning of the information age


 american peace 

pax americana is an appellation applied to the historical concept of relative liberal peace in the western world resulting from the preponderance of power enjoyed by the united states of america starting around the start of the 20th century although the term finds its primary utility in the latter half of the 20th century it has been used in various places and eras its modern connotations concern the peace established after the end of world war ii in 1945


 cold war era 

the cold war began in the mid-1940s and lasted into the early 1990s throughout this period the conflict was expressed through military coalitions espionage weapons development invasions propaganda and competitive technological development the conflict included costly defense spending a massive conventional and nuclear arms race and numerous proxy wars the two superpowers never fought one another directly

the soviet union created the eastern bloc of countries that it occupied annexing some as soviet socialist republics and maintaining others as satellite states that would later form the warsaw pact the united states and various western european countries began a policy of containment of communism and forged myriad alliances to this end including nato several of these western countries also coordinated efforts regarding the rebuilding of western europe including western germany which the soviets opposed in other regions of the world such as latin america and southeast asia the soviet union fostered communist revolutionary movements which the united states and many of its allies opposed and in some cases attempted to roll back many countries were prompted to align themselves with the nations that would later form either nato or the warsaw pact though other movements would also emerge

in china mao zedong máo zé dōng utilized marxist-leninist thought when the communist party of china assumed power in 1959 previous schools of chinese thought excepting notably legalism were denounced as backward many parts of chinas past were even purged during the cultural revolution though initially friendly with the soviet union the chinese and soviet communists diverged in the sino-soviet split of 1960 through the end of the cold-war china would continue on its own path from other communist countries building better relations with the united states after 1972 chinas economy would recover from the cultural revolution due to market-oriented reforms led by deng xiaoping
the cold war saw periods of both heightened tension and relative calm international crises arose such as the berlin blockade 1948–1949 the korean war 1950–1953 the berlin crisis of 1961 the vietnam war 1955–1975 the cuban missile crisis 1962 the soviet–afghan war 1979–1989 and nato exercises in november 1983 there were also periods of reduced tension as both sides sought détente direct military attacks on adversaries were deterred by the potential for mutual assured destruction using deliverable nuclear weapons

the cold war drew to a close in the late 1980s and the early 1990s the united states under president ronald reagan increased diplomatic military and economic pressure on the soviet union which was already suffering from severe economic stagnation in the second half of the 1980s newly appointed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev introduced the perestroika and glasnost reforms the soviet union collapsed in 1991 leaving the united states as the dominant military power though russia retained much of the massive soviet nuclear arsenal


 latin america polarization 
in latin america in the 1970s leftists acquired a significant political influence which prompted the right-wing ecclesiastical authorities and a large portion of the individual countrys upper class to support coups détat to avoid what they perceived as a communist threat this was further fueled by cuban and united states intervention which led to a political polarization most south american countries were in some periods ruled by military dictatorships that were supported by the united states of america in the 1970s the regimes of the southern cone collaborated in operation condor killing many leftist dissidents including some urban guerrillas however by the early 1990s all countries had restored their democracies


 space age 

the space age is a period encompassing the activities related to the space race space exploration space technology and the cultural developments influenced by these events the space age began with the development of several technologies that culminated with the launch of sputnik 1 by the soviet union in october 1957 this was the worlds first artificial satellite orbiting the earth in 98.1 minutes and weighing in at 83 kg the launch of sputnik 1 ushered a new era of political scientific and technological achievements that became known as the space age the space age was characterized by rapid development of new technology in a close race mostly between the united states and the soviet union the space age brought the first human spaceflight during the vostok programme and reached its peak with the apollo program which captured the imagination of much of the worlds population the landing of apollo 11 was an event watched by over 500 million people around the world and is widely recognized as one of the defining moments of the 20th century since then and with the end of the space race due to the dissolution of the soviet union public attention has largely moved to other areas


 education and schools 
the humanities are academic disciplines which study the human condition using methods that are primarily analytic critical or speculative as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural and social sciences although many of the subjects of modern history coincide with that of standard history the subject is taught independently by various systems of education in the world


 british education 
students can choose the subject at university the material covered includes from the mid-18th century to analysis of the present day virtually all colleges and sixth forms that do teach modern history do it alongside standard history very few teach the subject exclusively


 universities 
at the university of oxford modern history has a somewhat different meaning the contrast is not with the middle ages but with antiquity the earliest period that can be studied in the final honour school of modern history begins in 285
