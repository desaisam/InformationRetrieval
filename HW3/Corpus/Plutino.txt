in astronomy the plutinos are a dynamical group of trans-neptunian objects in the outermost region of the solar system that orbit in 23 mean-motion resonance with neptune this means that for every two orbits a plutino makes neptune orbits three times the dwarf planet pluto is the largest member and namesake of this group plutinos are named after mythological creatures associated with the underworld
plutinos form the inner part of the kuiper belt and represent about a quarter of the known kuiper belt objects they are the largest class of the resonant trans-neptunian objects also see adjunct box with hierarchical listing aside from pluto itself the first plutino 385185 1993 ro was discovered on september 16 1993


 orbits 


 origin 
it is thought that objects that are currently in mean orbital resonances with neptune initially followed independent heliocentric paths as neptune migrated outward early in the solar systems history see origins of the kuiper belt the bodies it approached would have been scattered during this process some of them would have been captured into resonances the 32 resonance is a low-order resonance and the strongest and most stable among all resonances this is the main reason it contains the largest number of bodies


 orbital characteristics 

while the majority of plutinos have low orbital inclinations a substantial number of them  follow orbits  similar to that of pluto with inclinations in the 10–25° range and eccentricities around 0.2–0.25 resulting in perihelia inside or close to the orbit of neptune and aphelia close to the main kuiper belts outer edge where objects have 12 resonance with neptune
the orbital periods of plutinos cluster around 247.3 years 1.5 × neptunes orbital period varying by at most a few years from this value
unusual plutinos include

2005 tv189 which follows the most highly inclined orbit 34.5°
15875 1996 tp66 which has the most elliptical orbit its eccentricity is 0.33 with the perihelion halfway between uranus and neptune
470308 2007 jh43 following a quasi-circular orbit
2002 vx130 lying almost perfectly on the ecliptic inclination less than 1.5°see also the comparison with the distribution of the cubewanos


 long-term stability 
the gravitational influence of pluto is usually neglected given its small mass however the resonance width the range of semi-axes compatible with the resonance is very narrow and only a few times larger than pluto’s hill sphere gravitational influence consequently depending on the original eccentricity some plutinos will be driven out of the resonance by interactions with pluto  numerical simulations suggest that the orbits of plutinos with an eccentricity 10–30% smaller or larger than that of pluto are not stable over ga timescales
