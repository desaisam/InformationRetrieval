ariel is the fourth-largest of the 27 known moons of uranus ariel orbits and rotates in the equatorial plane of uranus which is almost perpendicular to the orbit of uranus and so has an extreme seasonal cycle
it was discovered in october 1851 by william lassell and named for a character in two different pieces of literature as of 2017 much of the detailed knowledge of ariel derives from a single flyby of uranus performed by the spacecraft voyager 2 in 1986 which managed to image around 35% of the moons surface there are no active plans at present to return to study the moon in more detail although various concepts such as a uranus orbiter and probe have been proposed
after miranda ariel is the second-smallest of uranus five major rounded satellites and the second-closest to its planet among the smallest of the solar systems 19 known spherical moons it ranks 14th among them in diameter it is believed to be composed of roughly equal parts ice and rocky material its mass is approximately equal in magnitude to earths hydrosphere
like all of uranus moons ariel probably formed from an accretion disc that surrounded the planet shortly after its formation and like other large moons it is likely differentiated with an inner core of rock surrounded by a mantle of ice ariel has a complex surface consisting of extensive cratered terrain cross-cut by a system of scarps canyons and ridges the surface shows signs of more recent geological activity than other uranian moons most likely due to tidal heating


 discovery and name 
discovered on 24 october 1851 by william lassell it is named for a sky spirit in alexander popes the rape of the lock and shakespeares the tempest
both ariel and the slightly larger uranian satellite umbriel were discovered by william lassell on 24 october 1851 although william herschel who discovered uranuss two largest moons titania and oberon in 1787 claimed to have observed four additional moons this was never confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spuriousall of uranuss moons are named after characters from the works of william shakespeare or alexander popes the rape of the lock the names of all four satellites of uranus then known were suggested by john herschel in 1852 at the request of lassell ariel is named after the leading sylph in the rape of the lock it is also the name of the spirit who serves prospero in shakespeares the tempest the moon is also designated uranus i


 orbit 
among uranuss five major moons ariel is the second closest to the planet orbiting at the distance of about 190,000 km its orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of uranus its orbital period is around 2.5 earth days coincident with its rotational period this means that one side of the moon always faces the planet a condition known as tidal lock ariels orbit lies completely inside the uranian magnetosphere the trailing hemispheres those facing away from their directions of orbit of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere like ariel are struck by magnetospheric plasma co-rotating with the planet this bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres observed for all uranian moons except oberon see below ariel also captures magnetospheric charged particles producing a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moons orbit observed by voyager 2 in 1986because ariel like uranus orbits the sun almost on its side relative to its rotation its northern and southern hemispheres face either directly towards or directly away from the sun at the solstices this means it is subject to an extreme seasonal cycle just as earths poles see permanent night or daylight around the solstices so ariels poles see permanent night or daylight for half a uranian year 42 earth years with the sun rising close to the zenith over one of the poles at each solstice the voyager 2 flyby coincided with the 1986 southern summer solstice when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was dark once every 42 years when uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the earth mutual occultations of uranuss moons become possible a number of such events occurred in 2007–2008 including an occultation of ariel by umbriel on 19 august 2007currently ariel is not involved in any orbital resonance with other uranian satellites in the past however it may have been in a 53 resonance with miranda which could have been partially responsible for the heating of that moon although the maximum heating attributable to a former 13 resonance of umbriel with miranda was likely about three times greater ariel may have once been locked in the 41 resonance with titania from which it later escaped escape from a mean motion resonance is much easier for the moons of uranus than for those of jupiter or saturn due to uranuss lesser degree of oblateness this resonance which was likely encountered about 3.8 billion years ago would have increased ariels orbital eccentricity resulting in tidal friction due to time-varying tidal forces from uranus this would have caused warming of the moons interior by as much as 20 k


 composition and internal structure 

ariel is the fourth largest of the uranian moons and may have the third greatest mass the moons density is 1.66 gcm3 which indicates that it consists of roughly equal parts water ice and a dense non-ice component the latter could consist of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins the presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations which have revealed crystalline water ice on the surface of the moon which is porous and thus transmits little solar heat to layers below water ice absorption bands are stronger on ariels leading hemisphere than on its trailing hemisphere the cause of this asymmetry is not known but it may be related to bombardment by charged particles from uranuss magnetosphere which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere due to the plasmas co-rotation the energetic particles tend to sputter water ice decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics leaving a dark carbon-rich residue behindexcept for water the only other compound identified on the surface of ariel by infrared spectroscopy is carbon dioxide co2 which is concentrated mainly on its trailing hemisphere ariel shows the strongest spectroscopic evidence for co2 of any uranian satellite and was the first uranian satellite on which this compound was discovered the origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear it might be produced locally from carbonates or organic materials under the influence of the energetic charged particles coming from uranuss magnetosphere or solar ultraviolet radiation this hypothesis would explain the asymmetry in its distribution as the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere another possible source is the outgassing of primordial co2 trapped by water ice in ariels interior the escape of co2 from the interior may be related to past geological activity on this moongiven its size rockice composition and the possible presence of salt or ammonia in solution to lower the freezing point of water ariels interior may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle if this is the case the radius of the core 372 km is about 64% of the radius of the moon and its mass is around 56% of the moons mass—the parameters are dictated by the moons composition the pressure in the center of ariel is about 0.3 gpa 3 kbar the current state of the icy mantle is unclear although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely by some but possible by others


 surface 


 albedo and color 
ariel is the most reflective of uranuss moons its surface shows an opposition surge the reflectivity decreases from 53% at a phase angle of 0° geometrical albedo to 35% at an angle of about 1° the bond albedo of ariel is about 23—the highest among uranian satellites the surface of ariel is generally neutral in color there may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres the latter appears to be redder than the former by 2 ariels surface generally does not demonstrate any correlation between albedo and geology on the one hand and color on the other hand for instance canyons have the same color as the cratered terrain however bright impact deposits around some fresh craters are slightly bluer in color there are also some slightly blue spots which do not correspond to any known surface features


 surface features 

the observed surface of ariel can be divided into three terrain types cratered terrain ridged terrain and plains the main surface features are impact craters canyons fault scarps ridges and troughs

the cratered terrain a rolling surface covered by numerous impact craters and centered on ariels south pole is the moons oldest and most geographically extensive geological unit it is intersected by a network of scarps canyons graben and narrow ridges mainly occurring in ariels mid-southern latitudes the canyons known as chasmata probably represent graben formed by extensional faulting which resulted from global tensional stresses caused by the freezing of water or aqueous ammonia in the moons interior see below they are 15–50 km wide and trend mainly in an east- or northeasterly direction the floors of many canyons are convex rising up by 1–2 km sometimes the floors are separated from the walls of canyons by grooves troughs about 1 km wide the widest graben have grooves running along the crests of their convex floors which are called valles the longest canyon is kachina chasma at over 620 km in length the feature extends into the hemisphere of ariel that voyager 2 did not see illuminatedthe second main terrain type—ridged terrain—comprises bands of ridges and troughs hundreds of kilometers in extent it bounds the cratered terrain and cuts it into polygons within each band which can be up to 25 to 70 km wide are individual ridges and troughs up to 200 km long and between 10 and 35 km apart the bands of ridged terrain often form continuations of canyons suggesting that they may be a modified form of the graben or the result of a different reaction of the crust to the same extensional stresses such as brittle failure

the youngest terrain observed on ariel are the plains relatively low-lying smooth areas that must have formed over a long period of time judging by their varying levels of cratering the plains are found on the floors of canyons and in a few irregular depressions in the middle of the cratered terrain in the latter case they are separated from the cratered terrain by sharp boundaries which in some cases have a lobate pattern the most likely origin for the plains is through volcanic processes their linear vent geometry resembling terrestrial shield volcanoes and distinct topographic margins suggest that the erupted liquid was very viscous possibly a supercooled waterammonia solution with solid ice volcanism also a possibility the thickness of these hypothetical cryolava flows is estimated at 1–3 km the canyons must therefore have formed at a time when endogenic resurfacing was still taking place on ariel a few of these areas appear to be less than 100 million years old suggesting that ariel may still be geologically active in spite of its relatively small size and lack of current tidal heatingariel appears to be fairly evenly cratered compared to other moons of uranus the relative paucity of large craters suggests that its surface does not date to the solar systems formation which means that ariel must have been completely resurfaced at some point of its history ariels past geologic activity is believed to have been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently the largest crater observed on ariel yangoor is only 78 km across and shows signs of subsequent deformation all large craters on ariel have flat floors and central peaks and few of the craters are surrounded by bright ejecta deposits many craters are polygonal indicating that their appearance was influenced by the preexisting crustal structure in the cratered plains there are a few large about 100 km in diameter light patches that may be degraded impact craters if this is the case they would be similar to palimpsests on jupiters moon ganymede it has been suggested that a circular depression 245 km in diameter located at 10°s 30°e is a large highly degraded impact structure


 origin and evolution 
ariel is thought to have formed from an accretion disc or subnebula a disc of gas and dust that either existed around uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave uranus its large obliquity the precise composition of the subnebula is not known however the higher density of uranian moons compared to the moons of saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide co and molecular nitrogen n2 instead of methane and ammonia the moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice with co and n2 trapped as clathrate and more rock explaining the higher densitythe accretion process probably lasted for several thousand years before the moon was fully formed models suggest that impacts accompanying accretion caused heating of ariels outer layer reaching a maximum temperature of around 195 k at a depth of about 31 km after the end of formation the subsurface layer cooled while the interior of ariel heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks the cooling near-surface layer contracted while the interior expanded this caused strong extensional stresses in the moons crust reaching estimates of 30 mpa which may have led to cracking some present-day scarps and canyons may be a result of this process which lasted for about 200 million yearsthe initial accretional heating together with continued decay of radioactive elements and likely tidal heating may have led to melting of the ice if an antifreeze like ammonia in the form of ammonia hydrate or some salt was present the melting may have led to the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle a layer of liquid water ocean rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core–mantle boundary the eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176 k the ocean however is likely to have frozen long ago the freezing of the water likely led to the expansion of the interior which may have been responsible for the formation of the canyons and obliteration of the ancient surface the liquids from the ocean may have been able to erupt to the surface flooding floors of canyons in the process known as cryovolcanismthermal modeling of saturns moon dione which is similar to ariel in size density and surface temperature suggests that solid state convection could have lasted in ariels interior for billions of years and that temperatures in excess of 173 k the melting point of aqueous ammonia may have persisted near its surface for several hundred million years after formation and near a billion years closer to the core


 observation and exploration 

the apparent magnitude of ariel is 14.8 similar to that of pluto near perihelion however while pluto can be seen through a telescope of 30 cm aperture ariel due to its proximity to uranuss glare is often not visible to telescopes of 40 cm aperturethe only close-up images of ariel were obtained by the voyager 2 probe which photographed the moon during its flyby of uranus in january 1986 the closest approach of voyager 2 to ariel was 127,000 km 79,000 mi—significantly less than the distances to all other uranian moons except miranda the best images of ariel have a spatial resolution of about 2 km they cover about 40% of the surface but only 35% was photographed with the quality required for geological mapping and crater counting at the time of the flyby the southern hemisphere of ariel like those of the other moons was pointed towards the sun so the northern dark hemisphere could not be studied no other spacecraft has ever visited the uranian system the possibility of sending the cassini spacecraft to uranus was evaluated during its mission extension planning phase it would have taken about twenty years to get to the uranian system after departing saturn and these plans were scrapped in favour of remaining at saturn and eventually destroying the spacecraft in saturns atmosphere


 transits 
on 26 july 2006 the hubble space telescope captured a rare transit made by ariel on uranus which cast a shadow that could be seen on the uranian cloud tops such events are rare and only occur around equinoxes as the moons orbital plane about uranus is tilted 98° to uranuss orbital plane about the sun another transit in 2008 was recorded by the european southern observatory
