 nasa career 
before joining nasa as a member of the first group of scientist-astronauts in june 1965 he worked at the us geological surveys astrogeology center at flagstaff arizona developing geological field techniques that would be used by the apollo crews following his selection schmitt spent his first year at air force upt learning to become a jet pilot upon his return to the astronaut corps in houston he played a key role in training apollo crews to be geologic observers when they were in lunar orbit and competent geologic field workers when they were on the lunar surface after each of the landing missions he participated in the examination and evaluation of the returned lunar samples and helped the crews with the scientific aspects of their mission reports
schmitt spent considerable time becoming proficient in the csm and lm systems  in march 1970 he became the first of the scientist-astronauts to be assigned to space flight joining richard f gordon jr commander and vance brand command module pilot on the apollo 15 backup crew the flight rotation put these three in line to fly as prime crew on the third following mission apollo 18 when apollo flights 18 and 19 were cancelled in september 1970 the community of lunar geologists supporting apollo felt so strongly about the need to land a professional geologist on the moon that they pressured nasa to reassign schmitt to a remaining flight as a result schmitt was assigned in august 1971 to fly on the last mission apollo 17 replacing joe engle as lunar module pilot schmitt landed on the moon with commander gene cernan in december 1972schmitt claims to have taken the photograph of the earth known as the blue marble possibly one of the most widely distributed photographic images in existence nasa officially credits the image to the entire apollo 17 crew
while on the moons surface schmitt — the only geologist in the astronaut corps — collected the rock sample designated troctolite 76535 which has been called without doubt the most interesting sample returned from the moon  among other distinctions it is the central piece of evidence suggesting that the moon once possessed an active magnetic fieldas he returned to the lunar module before cernan schmitt is the next-to-last person to have walked on the moons surface
after the completion of apollo 17 schmitt played an active role in documenting the apollo geologic results and also took on the task of organizing nasas energy program office

 views on global warming 

schmitts view on climate change diverges from the frequently reported scientific consensus as he emphasizes natural over human factors as driving climate  schmitt has expressed the view that the risks posed by climate change are overrated and suggests instead that climate change is a tool for people who are trying to increase the size of government  he resigned his membership in the planetary society primarily because of its mars-first policy but also because of its stance on global warming writing in his resignation letter that the global warming scare is being used as a political tool to increase government control over american lives incomes and decision-making  schmitt spoke at the march 2009 international conference on climate change sponsored by the heartland institute he appeared in december that year on the fox business network saying the co2 scare is a red herringin a 2009 interview with conspiracy theorist and talk-radio host alex jones schmitt asserted a link between soviet communism and the american environmental movement i think the whole trend really began with the fall of the soviet union because the great champion of the opponents of liberty namely communism had to find some other place to go and they basically went into the environmental movement at the heartland institutes sixth international conference on climate change schmitt said that climate change was a stalking horse for national socialismschmitt co-authored a may 8 2013 wall street journal opinion column with william happer contending that increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are not significantly correlated with global warming attributing the single-minded demonization of this natural and essential atmospheric gas to advocates of government control of energy production noting a positive relationship between crop resistance to drought and increasing carbon dioxide levels the authors argued contrary to what some would have us believe increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will benefit the increasing population on the planet by increasing agricultural productivity
