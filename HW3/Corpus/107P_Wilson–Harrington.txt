4015 wilson–harrington is a small solar system body known both as comet wilson–harrington or 107pwilson–harrington and as an asteroid designated 4015 wilson–harrington
this near-earth object is considered both an apollo asteroid with the designation 4015 wilson–harrington and a periodic comet known as comet wilson–harrington or 107pwilson–harrington it was initially discovered in 1949 as a comet and then lost to further observations thirty years later it was rediscovered as an asteroid after which it took over a decade to determine that these observations were of the same object therefore it has both a comet designation and an asteroid designation and with a name length of 17 characters it is currently the asteroid with the longest name having one more character than the 16-character limit imposed by the iauthe comet was discovered on november 19 1949 by albert g wilson and robert g harrington at palomar observatory  only three photographic observations were obtained and the comet was lost insufficient observations to determine a precise enough orbit to know where to look for future appearances of the comet see lost comet
on november 15 1979 an apparent mars-crosser asteroid was found by eleanor f helin also of palomar observatory it received the designation 1979 va and when re-observed on december 20 1988 received the permanent number 4015
on august 13 1992 it was reported that asteroid 4015 1979 va and comet 107pwilson–harrington were the same object by then enough observations of the asteroid had been accumulated to obtain a fairly precise orbit and the search of old photographic plates for pre-discovery images turned up the 1949 plates with the images of the lost comet
although the 1949 images show cometary features all subsequent images show only a stellar image suggesting it may be an inactive comet that undergoes only infrequent outbursts
the eccentricity is 0.624 which is somewhat higher than that of a typical asteroid-belt minor planet and more typical of periodic comets  its minimum orbit intersection distance moid of less than 0.05 au and its large size make it a potentially hazardous asteroid pha
there are only seven other objects that are cross-listed as both comets and asteroids 2060 chiron 95pchiron 7968 elst–pizarro 133pelst–pizarro 60558 echeclus 174pecheclus 118401 linear 176plinear 323137 2003 bm80 282p2003 bm80 300163 2006 vw139 288p2006 vw139 and 457175 2008 go98 362p2008 go98 as a dual status object astrometric observations of 4015 wilson–harrington should be reported under the minor planet designationa flyby of 4015 wilson–harrington was formerly planned by deep space 1 it was also considered for the near mission
