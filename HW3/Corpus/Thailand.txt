 early states 

after the decline of the khmer empire and kingdom of pagan in the early 13th century various states thrived in their place the domains of tai people existed from the northeast of present-day india to the north of present-day laos and to the malay peninsula during the 13th century tai people have already settled in the core land of dvaravati and lavo kingdom to nakhon si thammarat in the south there are however no records detailing the arrival of the tais around 1240s pho khun bang klang hao a local tai ruler rallied the people to rebel against the khmer he later crowned himself the first king of sukhothai kingdom in 1238 mainstream thai historians count sukhothai as the first kingdom of thai people sukhothai expanded furthest during the reign of ram khamhaeng 1279–98 however it was mostly a network of local lords who swore fealty to sukhothai not directly controlled by it he is believed to invent thai script and thai ceramics was an important export goods in his era sukhothai embraced theravada buddhism in the reign of maha thammaracha i 1347–68
to the north mangrai who descended from a local ruler linage of ngoenyang founded the kingdom of lan na in 1292 centered in chiang mai he unified the surrounding area and his dynasty would rule the kingdom continuously for the next two centuries he also created a network of state through political alliance to the east and north of mekong while in the port in lower chao phraya basin a federation around phetchaburi suphan buri lopburi and ayutthaya area was created in the 11th century


 ayutthaya kingdom 

according to the most widely accepted version of its origin ayutthaya kingdom rose from the earlier nearby lavo kingdom and suvarnabhumi with uthong as its first king ayutthaya was a patchwork of self-governing principalities and tributary provinces owing allegiance to the king of ayutthaya under mandala system its initial expansion is through conquest and political marriage before the end of the 15th century ayutthaya invaded khmer empire twice and sacked its capital angkor ayutthaya then became a regional great power in place of khmer empire constant interference of sukhothai effectively made it a vassal state of ayutthaya and was finally incorporated in to the kingdom borommatrailokkanat brought about bureaucratic reforms which lasted into the 20th century and created a system of social hierarchy called sakdina where common male was conscripted into corvée for six months a year ayutthaya was interested in malay peninsula but failed to conquer malacca sultanate which was supported by chinese ming dynasty
european contact and trade started in the early 16th century with the envoy of portuguese duke afonso de albuquerque in 1511 followed by the french dutch and english rivalry for supremacy over chiang mai and mon people pitted ayutthaya against burmese kingdom multiple war with its ruling dynasty taungoo dynasty starting in the 1540s in the reign of tabinshwehti and bayinnaung were ultimately ended with capture of the capital in 1570 then was a period of brief vassalage to burma until naresuan proclaimed independence in 1584

ayutthaya then seek to improve relations with european powers for many successive reigns the kingdom especially prospered during cosmopolitan narais reign 1656–88 where some european travelers regarded ayutthaya as asian great powers alongside china and india however growing french influence later in his reign was met with nationalist sentiment and led eventually to the revolution of 1688 however overall relations remain stable with french missionaries still active in preaching christianity
after that there was a period of relative peace but the kingdoms influence gradually waned partly because of bloody struggles over each succession until the capital ayutthaya was utterly destroyed in 1767 by burmas new alaungpaya dynasty anarchy followed destruction of the former capital with its territories split into five different factions each controlled by a warlord taksin rose to power and proclaimed thonburi as temporary capital in the same year he also quickly subdued the other warlords his forces engaged in wars with burma laos and cambodia which successfully drove the burmese out of lan na in 1775 captured vientiane in 1778 and tried to install a pro-thai king in cambodia in the 1770s in his final years there was a coup which was caused by his supposedly insanity and eventually taksin and his sons were executed by longtime companion general chao phraya chakri future rama i he was the first king of the ruling chakri dynasty and founder of bangkok rattanakosin kingdom on april 6 1782


 modernization and centralization 

under rama i 1782–1809 rattanakosin successfully defended against burmese attacks and put an end to burmese invasion he also created overlordship over large portions of laos and cambodia in 1821 john crawfurd was sent on a mission to negotiate a new trade agreement with siam — the first sign of an issue which was to dominate 19th-century siamese politics bangkok signed burney treaty in 1826 after the british victory in first anglo-burmese war anouvong of vientiane who misunderstood that britain was about to attack bangkok started the lao rebellion in 1826 and was defeated vientiane was destroyed and a large number of lao people was relocated to khorat plateau as the result bangkok also waged multiple wars with vietnam where bangkok successfully regained influence over cambodia

since the late 19th century siam tried to subdue the ethnic groups in the realm as colony in the reign of mongkut 1851–68 who recognized the threat of western powers the court contacted the british government directly to defuse the tension a british mission led by sir john bowring governor of hong kong led to the conclusion of bowring treaty first of many unequal treaties with western countries it however brought economic development in bangkok and international trade the unexpected death of mongkut by malaria led to succession by young prince chulalongkorn and somdet chaophraya sri suriwongse chuang bunnag acted as a regent
chulalongkorn r 1868–1910 initiated centralization set up a privy council and abolished slavery and corvée system front palace crisis of 1874 stalled reformation attempt in the 1870s and 1880s he incorporated the protectorate up north into the kingdom proper which later expanded to the protectorate in the northeast and the south he established twelve krom in 1888 which was equivalent to present-day ministries crisis of 1893 which was caused by french demands of laotian territory east of mekong france and britain agreed between themselves to make siam buffer state it was not until the 20th century can siam renegotiate every unequal treaty since bowring treaty including extraterritoriality but had to pay with many territorial exchanges the advent of monthon system marked the creation of modern nation-state in 1905 there was rebellions in ancient pattani area ubon ratchathani and phrae to oppose an attempt to subdue the power of local ruling lords
palace revolt of 1912 was a failed attempt by western-educated military officers who aimed to overthrow absolute monarchy vajiravudh r 1910–25 responded by propaganda for the entirety of his reign he promoted the idea of thai nation in 1917 siam joined world war i on the side of the allies because there were concerns that the allies may react to neutral countries and desire to amend past unequal treaties in the aftermath siam joined paris peace conference gained freedom of taxation and cancellation of extraterritoriality


 constitutional monarchy world war ii and cold war 

the bloodless revolution took place in 1932 carried out by the khana ratsadon group of military and civilian officials resulted in a transition of power when prajadhipok was forced to grant the people of siam their first constitution thereby ending centuries of absolute monarchy it was the combined results of economic hardship felt by the great depression sharply fell rice price and significantly reduction in public spending causing discontent among aristocrats in 1933 a counter-revolutionary rebellion occurred which aimed to reinstate absolute monarchy but failed prajadhipoks conflict with the government eventually led to abdication the government selected ananda mahidol who was studying in switzerland to be the new king
later that decade the military wing of khana ratsadon came to dominate siamese politics plaek phibunsongkhram who became premier in 1938 started political oppression and took openly anti-royalist stance his government adopted nationalism and westernization anti-chinese and anti-french policies in 1940 there was a decree changing the name of the country from siam to thailand in 1941 thailand was in a brief conflict with vichy france resulting in thailand gained laotian and cambodian territories until the war ends on december 8 1941 japan invaded thailand and the government quickly agreed to join military alliance with japan the government also declare war on the united states and the united kingdom free thai movement was launched both in thailand and abroad to oppose the government and japanese occupation after the war ends in 1945 thailand signed formal agreement to end the state of war with the allies most allied powers did not recognize thailands declaration of war

in june 1946 young king ananda was found dead under mysterious circumstances his younger brother bhumibol adulyadej succeeded the throne thailand signed southeast asia treaty organization seato to became an active ally of the united states since 1954 field marshal sarit thanarat launched a coup in 1957 which removed khana ratsadon from politics his rule was autocratic he built his legitimacy around the god-like status of the monarch and by channeling the governments loyalty to the king his government improved the countrys infrastructure and education after the us joined vietnam war in 1961 there was a secret agreement where the us promised to protect thailand
the period brought about increasing modernisation and westernisation internal conflict regarding economic difficulties which began in 1968 led to 1973 thai popular uprising an important event in thai modern history


 contemporary history 

constant unrest and instability as well as fear of communist takeover after fall of saigon made some ultra-right groups brand increasingly leftist students as communists this culminated in thammasat university massacre in october 1976 a coup détat on that very day brought thailand a new ultra-right government which oppressed many media outlets officials and intellectuals and fueled the communist insurgency further another coup in the following year installed a more moderate government which offered amnesty to communist fighters in 1978 the party abandoned the insurgency by 1983 thailand had its first elected prime minister in 1988suchinda kraprayoon who was the coup leader in 1991 and said he would not seek to become prime minister was nominated as one by majority coalition government after the 1992 general election this caused a popular demonstration in bangkok which ended with a military crackdown bhumibol intervened in the event and suchinda then resigned

the 1997 asian financial crisis originated in thailand and forced the country to take an imf loan with unpopular provisions the populist thai rak thai party led by prime minister thaksin shinawatra governed from 2001 until 2006 a south thailand insurgency escalated starting from 2004 the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami hit the country mostly in the south massive protests against thaksin led by the peoples alliance for democracy pad ended with a coup détat in 2006
in 2007 a civilian government led by the thaksin-allied peoples power party ppp was elected another protest led by pad ended with the dissolution of ppp and the democrat party led a coalition government in its place the pro-thaksin united front for democracy against dictatorship udd protested both in 2009 and in 2010
after the general election of 2011 the populist pheu thai party won a majority and yingluck shinawatra thaksins younger sister became prime minister the peoples democratic reform committee organized another anti-shinawatra protest which ended with another coup détat in 2014 and democracy was replaced with what the rulers called national harmony  the national council for peace and order a military junta led by general prayut chan-o-cha has led the country since the referendum and adoption of thailands current constitution happened under the juntas rule in 2016 bhumibol the longest reigning thai king died and his son vajiralongkorn ascended the throne in 2019 the kings sister ubolratana rajakanya sirivadhana varnavadi was nominated to be a candidate for prime minister by a political party associated with the shinawatra political family the king however dismissed the nomination as inappropriate behaviour that went against the nations constitutional monarchy also declaring his candidacy was ruling prime minister prayuth chan-ocha a defender of the thai monarchy he was backed by the military led palang pracharat party the ruling junta restricts freedom of speech and assembly those who violate or who are seen to be political opponents to the ruling party members are sent to attitude adjustment  camps in addition citizens who insult the monarchy are subject to strict  lèse-majesté laws prosecution under these laws that make it a crime to criticize or insult the king have increased significantly in recent years


 politics and government 

prior to 1932 all legislative powers were vested in the monarch this had been the case since the foundation of the sukhothai kingdom in the 12th century as the king was seen as a dharmaraja or king who rules in accordance with dharma the buddhist law of righteousness modern absolute monarchy was established by chulalongkorn when he transformed the decentralized protectorate system into a unitary state on 24 june 1932 khana ratsadon peoples party carried out a bloodless revolution which ended the absolute rule
the politics of thailand is conducted within the framework of a constitutional monarchy whereby the prime minister is the head of government and a hereditary monarch is head of state the judiciary is supposed to be independent of the executive and the legislative branches although judicial rulings are suspected of being based on political considerations rather than on existing law however since may 2014 thailand has been ruled by a military junta the national council for peace and order

thailand has had 20 constitutions and charters since 1932 including the latest and current 2017 constitution throughout this time the form of government has ranged from military dictatorship to electoral democracy but all governments have acknowledged a hereditary monarch as the head of state thailand has had the 4th most coups in the world uniformed or ex-military men have led thailand for 55 of the 83 years between 1932 and 2009the legislative branch under the 2007 constitution was the bicameral national assembly composed of the senate the 150-member upper house and house of representatives the 350-member lower house since 2014 coup it was replaced by a rubber stamp unicameral national legislative assembly
the current king of thailand is vajiralongkorn or rama x since october 2016 under the constitution the powers of the king are limited and he is primarily a symbol of the thai nation as the head of state he is given some powers and has a role to play in the workings of government according to the constitution the king is head of the armed forces he is required to be buddhist as well as the defender of all faiths in the country the king also retained some traditional powers such as the power to appoint his heirs the power to grant pardons and the royal assent the king is aided in his duties by the privy council of thailand
since the 2000s two political parties dominated thai general elections one was pheu thai party which was a successor of peoples power party and thai rak thai party respectively and the other was democrat party the political parties which support thaksin shinawatra won the most representatives every general election since 2001 in a controversial move the pro-army


 domestic human rights 

the 2007 constitution was partially abrogated by the military dictatorship that came to power in may 2014thailands kings are protected by lèse-majesté laws which allows critics to be jailed for three to fifteen years after the 2014 thai coup détat thailand had the highest number of lèse-majesté prisoners in the nations history in 2017 the military court in thailand sentenced a man to 35 years in prison for violating the countrys lèse-majesté law thailand has been rated not free on the freedom house index since 2014 thai activist and magazine editor somyot prueksakasemsuk who was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for lèse-majesté in 2013 is a designated prisoner of conscience by amnesty international


 geography 

totalling 513,120 square kilometres 198,120 sq mi thailand is the 50th-largest country by total area it is slightly smaller than yemen and slightly larger than spain
thailand comprises several distinct geographic regions partly corresponding to the provincial groups the north of the country is the mountainous area of the thai highlands with the highest point being doi inthanon in the thanon thong chai range at 2,565 metres 8,415 ft above sea level the northeast isan consists of the khorat plateau bordered to the east by the mekong river the centre of the country is dominated by the predominantly flat chao phraya river valley which runs into the gulf of thailand

southern thailand consists of the narrow kra isthmus that widens into the malay peninsula politically there are six geographical regions which differ from the others in population basic resources natural features and level of social and economic development the diversity of the regions is the most pronounced attribute of thailands physical setting
the chao phraya and the mekong river are the indispensable water courses of rural thailand industrial scale production of crops use both rivers and their tributaries the gulf of thailand covers 320,000 square kilometres 124,000 sq mi and is fed by the chao phraya mae klong bang pakong and tapi rivers it contributes to the tourism sector owing to its clear shallow waters along the coasts in the southern region and the kra isthmus the eastern shore of the gulf of thailand is an industrial centre of thailand with the kingdoms premier deepwater port in sattahip and its busiest commercial port laem chabang

the andaman sea is a precious natural resource as it hosts the most popular and luxurious resorts in asia phuket krabi ranong phang nga and trang and their islands all lay along the coasts of the andaman sea and despite the 2004 tsunami they remain a tourist magnet for visitors from around the world
plans have resurfaced for a canal which would connect the andaman sea to the gulf of thailand analogous to the suez and the panama canals the idea has been greeted positively by thai politicians as it would cut fees charged by the ports of singapore improve ties with china and india lower shipping times and eliminate pirate attacks in the strait of malacca and support the thai governments policy of being the logistical hub for southeast asia the canal it is claimed would improve economic conditions in the south of thailand which relies heavily on tourism income and it would also change the structure of the thai economy by making it an asia logistical hub the canal would be a major engineering project and has an expected cost of us20–30 billion


 climate 

thailands climate is influenced by monsoon winds that have a seasonal character the southwest and northeast monsoon the southwest monsoon which starts from may until october is characterized by movement of warm moist air from the indian ocean to thailand causing abundant rain over most of the country the northeast monsoon starting from october until february brings cold and dry air from china over most of thailand in southern thailand the northeast monsoon brings mild weather and abundant rainfall on the eastern coast of that region most of thailand has a tropical wet and dry or savanna climate type köppens tropical savanna climate the south and the eastern tip of the east have a tropical monsoon climate
thailand is divided into three seasons the first is the rainy or southwest monsoon season mid–may to mid–october which prevails over most of the country this season is characterized by abundant rain with august and september being the wettest period of the year this can occasionally lead to floods in addition to rainfall caused by the southwest monsoon the intertropical convergence zone itcz  and tropical cyclones also contribute to producing heavy rainfall during the rainy season nonetheless dry spells commonly occur for 1 to 2 weeks from june to early july this is due to the northward movement of the intertropical convergence zone to southern china winter or the northeast monsoon starts from mid–october until mid–february most of thailand experiences dry weather during this season with mild temperatures the exception is the southern parts of thailand where it receives abundant rainfall particularly during october to november summer or the pre–monsoon season runs from mid–february until mid–may and is characterized by warmer weatherdue to its inland nature and latitude the north northeast central and eastern parts of thailand experience a long period of warm weather during the hottest time of the year march to may temperatures usually reach up to 40 °c 104 °f or more with the exception of coastal areas where sea breezes moderate afternoon temperatures in contrast outbreaks of cold air from china can bring colder temperatures in some cases particularly the north and northeast close to or below 0 °c 32 °f southern thailand is characterized by mild weather year-round with less diurnal and seasonal variations in temperatures due to maritime influencesmost of the country receives a mean annual rainfall of 1,200 to 1,600 mm 47 to 63 in however certain areas on the windward sides of mountains such as ranong province in the west coast of southern thailand and eastern parts of trat province receive more than 4,500 mm 180 in of rainfall per year the driest areas are on the leeward side in the central valleys and northernmost portion of south thailand where mean annual rainfall is less than 1,200 mm 47 in most of thailand north northeast central and east is characterized by dry weather during the northeast monsoon and abundant rainfall during the southwest monsoon in the southern parts of thailand abundant rainfall occurs in both the northeast and southwest monsoon seasons with a peak in september for the western coast and a peak in november–january on the eastern coast


 environment 
thailand has a mediocre but improving performance in the global environmental performance index epi with an overall ranking of 91 out of 180 countries in 2016 this is also a mediocre rank in the asia pacific region specifically but ahead of countries like indonesia and china the epi was established in 2001 by the world economic forum as a global gauge to measure how well individual countries perform in implementing the united nations sustainable development goals the environmental areas where thailand performs worst ie highest ranking are air quality 167 environmental effects of the agricultural industry 106 and the climate and energy sector 93 the later mainly because of a high co2 emission per kwh produced thailand performs best ie lowest ranking in water resource management 66 with some major improvements expected for the future too and sanitation 68


 wildlife 

the elephant is thailands national symbol although there were 100,000 domesticated elephants in thailand in 1850 the population of elephants has dropped to an estimated 2,000 poachers have long hunted elephants for ivory and hides and now increasingly for meat young elephants are often captured for use in tourist attractions or as work animals although their use has declined since the government banned logging in 1989 there are now more elephants in captivity than in the wild and environmental activists claim that elephants in captivity are often mistreatedpoaching of protected species remains a major problem hunters have decimated the populations of tigers leopards and other large cats for their valuable pelts many animals including tigers bears crocodiles and king cobras are farmed or hunted for their meat which is considered a delicacy and for their supposed medicinal properties although such trade is illegal the famous bangkok market chatuchak is still known for the sale of endangered speciesthe practice of keeping wild animals as pets threatens several species baby animals are typically captured and sold which often requires killing the mother once in captivity and out of their natural habitat many pets die or fail to reproduce affected populations include the asiatic black bear malayan sun bear white-handed lar pileated gibbon and binturong

 regions 

thai provinces are administrated by regions the regions that thailand uses to divide the provinces is the four-region division system it divides the country into the four regions
northern thailand northeastern thailand central thailand
and southern thailand each region has its own different historical background culture language and people
in contrast to the administrative divisions of the provinces of thailand thailand is a unitary state the provincial governors district chiefs and district clerks are appointed by the central government the regions themselves do not have an administrative character but are used for geographical statistical geological meteorological or touristic purposes


 southern region 

thailand controlled the malay peninsula as far south as malacca in the 15th century and held much of the peninsula including temasek singapore some of the andaman islands and a colony on java but eventually contracted when the british used force to guarantee their suzerainty over the sultanate
mostly the northern states of the malay sultanate presented annual gifts to the thai king in the form of a golden flower—a gesture of tribute and an acknowledgement of vassalage the british intervened in the malay state and with the anglo-siamese treaty tried to build a railway from the south to bangkok thailand relinquished sovereignty over what are now the northern malay provinces of kedah perlis kelantan and terengganu to the british satun and pattani provinces were given to thailand
the malay peninsular provinces were occupied by the japanese during world war ii and infiltrated by the malayan communist party cpm from 1942 to 2008 when they sued for peace with the malaysian and thai governments after the cpm lost its support from vietnam and china subsequent to the cultural revolution recent insurgent uprisings may be a continuation of separatist fighting which started after world war ii with sukarnos support for the pulo  most victims since the uprisings have been buddhist and muslim bystanders
