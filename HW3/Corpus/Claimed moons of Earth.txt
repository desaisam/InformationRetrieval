claims of the existence of other moons of earth—that is of one or more natural satellites other than the moon that orbit earth—have existed for some time several candidates have been proposed but none has been confirmed since the 19th century scientists have made genuine searches for more moons but the possibility has also been the subject of a number of dubious non-scientific speculations as well as a number of likely hoaxesalthough the moon is earths only natural satellite there are a number of near-earth objects neos with orbits that are in resonance with earth these have been called inaccurately second third or other moons of earth2016 ho3 an asteroid discovered on 27 april 2016 is possibly the most stable quasi-satellite of earth as it orbits the sun 2016 ho3 appears to circle around earth as well it is too distant to be a true satellite of earth but is the best and most stable example of a quasi-satellite a type of near-earth object they appear to orbit a point other than earth itself such as the orbital path of the neo asteroid 3753 cruithne earth trojans such as 2010 tk7 are neos that orbit the sun not earth on the same orbital path as earth and appear to lead or follow earth along the same orbital path
other small natural objects in orbit around the sun may enter orbit around earth for a short amount of time becoming temporary natural satellites to date the only confirmed example has been 2006 rh120 in earth orbit during 2006 and 2007 though further instances are already predicted


 history 


 petits moon 
the first major claim of another moon of earth was made by french astronomer frédéric petit director of the toulouse observatory who in 1846 announced that he had discovered a second moon in an elliptical orbit around earth
it was claimed to have also been reported by lebon and dassier at toulouse and by larivière at artenac observatory during the early evening of march 21 1846petit proposed that this second moon had an elliptical orbit a period of 2 hours 44 minutes with 3,570 km 2,220 mi apogee and 11.4 km 7.1 mi perigee this claim was soon dismissed by his peers the 11.4 km 37,000 ft perigee is similar to the cruising altitude of most modern airliners and within earths atmosphere petit published another paper on his 1846 observations in 1861 basing the second moons existence on perturbations in movements of the actual moon this second moon hypothesis was not confirmed either
petits proposed moon became a plot point in jules vernes 1870 science fiction novel around the moon


 waltemaths moons 
in 1898 hamburg scientist dr georg waltemath announced that he had located a system of tiny moons orbiting earth he had begun his search for secondary moons based on the hypothesis that something was gravitationally affecting the moons orbitwaltemath described one of the proposed moons as being 1,030,000 km 640,000 mi from earth with a diameter of 700 km 430 mi a 119-day orbital period and a 177-day synodic period he also said it did not reflect enough sunlight to be observed without a telescope unless viewed at certain times and made several predictions of its next appearances sometimes it shines at night like the sun but only for an hour or soe stone wiggins a canadian weather expert ascribed the cold spring of 1907 to the effect of a second moon which he said he had first seen in 1882 and had publicized the find in 1884 in the new york tribune when he put it forward as probable cause of an anomalous solar eclipse of may of that year he said it was also probably the green crescent moon seen in new zealand and later in north america in 1886 for periods of less than a half-hour each time he said this was the second moon seen by  waltemath in 1898 wiggins hypothesized that the second moon had a high carbon atmosphere but could be seen occasionally by its reflected lightthe existence of these objects put forward by waltemath and wiggins was discredited after the absence of corroborating observation by other members of the scientific community especially problematic was a failed prediction that they would be seen in february 1898the august 1898 issue of science mentioned that waltemath had sent the journal an announcement of a third moon which he termed a wahrhafter wetter und magnet mond real weather and magnet moon it was supposedly 746 km 464 mi in diameter and closer than the second moon that he had seen previously


 other claims 
in 1918 astrologer walter gornold also known as sepharial claimed to have confirmed the existence of waltemaths moon he named it lilith sepharial claimed that lilith was a dark moon invisible for most of the time but he claimed to be the first person in history to view it as it crossed the sunin 1926 the science journal die sterne published the findings of amateur german astronomer w spill who claimed to have successfully viewed a second moon orbiting earthin the late 1960s john bargby claimed to have observed over ten small natural satellites of earth but this was not confirmed


 general surveys 
william henry pickering 1858–1938 studied the possibility of a second moon and made a general search ruling out the possibility of many types of objects by 1903 his 1922 article a meteoritic satellite in popular astronomy resulted in increased searches for small natural satellites by amateur astronomers pickering had also proposed the moon itself had broken off from earthin early 1954 the united states armys office of ordnance research commissioned clyde tombaugh discoverer of pluto to search for near-earth asteroids the army issued a public statement to explain the rationale for this survey donald keyhoe who was later director of the national investigations committee on aerial phenomena nicap a ufo research group said that his pentagon source had told him that the actual reason for the quickly initiated search was that two near-earth objects had been picked up on new long-range radar in mid-1953 in may 1954 keyhoe asserted that the search had been successful and either one or two objects had been found at the pentagon a general who heard the news reportedly asked whether the satellites were natural or artificial tombaugh denied the alleged discovery in a letter to willy ley and the october 1955 issue of popular mechanics magazine reported

 professor tombaugh is closemouthed about his results he wont say whether or not any small natural satellites have been discovered he does say however that newspaper reports of 18 months ago announcing the discovery of natural satellites at 400 and 600 miles out are not correct he adds that there is no connection between the search program and the reports of so-called flying saucers
at a meteor conference in los angeles in 1957 tombaugh reiterated that his four-year search for natural satellites had been unsuccessful in 1959 he issued a final report stating that nothing had been found in his search


 modern status 

it was discovered that small bodies can be temporarily captured as shown by 2006 rh120 which was in earth orbit in 2006–2007in 2010 the first known earth trojan was discovered in data from wide-field infrared survey explorer wise and is currently called 2010 tk7
in 2011 planetary scientists erik asphaug and martin jutzi proposed a model in which a second moon would have existed 4.5 billion years ago and later impacted the moon as a part of the accretion process in the formation of the moonin 2018 it was confirmed two dust clouds orbited earth at l4 and l5  which were possibly moons in the past
the aforementioned dust clouds were nicknamed earths hidden moons


 quasi-satellites and trojans 

although no other moons of earth have been found to date there are various types of near-earth objects in 11 resonance with it which are known as quasi-satellites quasi-satellites orbit the sun from the same distance as a planet rather than the planet itself their orbits are unstable and will fall into other resonances or be kicked into other orbits over thousands of years quasi-satellites of earth include 2010 so16 164207 2004 gu9277810 2006 fv35 2002 aa29 2014 ol339 2013 lx28 2016 ho3
and 3753 cruithne cruithne discovered in 1986 orbits the sun in an elliptical orbit but appears to have a horseshoe orbit when viewed from earth some went as far to nickname cruithne earths second moonthe key difference between a satellite and a quasi-satellite is that the orbit of a satellite of earth fundamentally depends on the gravity of the earth–moon system whereas the orbit of a quasi-satellite would negligibly change if earth and the moon were suddenly removed because a quasi-satellite is orbiting the sun on an earth-like orbit in the vicinity of earthearth possesses one known trojan a small solar system body caught in the planets gravitationally stable l4 lagrangian point this object 2010 tk7 is roughly 300 metres across like quasi-satellites it orbits the sun in a 11 resonance with earth rather than earth itself


 temporary satellites 
on 14 september 2006 an object estimated at 5 meters in diameter was discovered in near-polar orbit around earth originally thought to be a third-stage saturn s-ivb booster from apollo 12 it was later determined to be an asteroid and designated as 2006 rh120 the asteroid re-entered solar orbit after 13 months and is expected to return to earth orbit after 21 yearscomputer models by astrophysicists mikael granvik jeremie vaubaillon and robert jedicke suggest that these temporary satellites should be quite common and that at any given time there should be at least one natural earth satellite of 1-meter diameter orbiting the earth such objects would remain in orbit for ten months on average before returning to solar orbit once more and so would make relatively easy targets for manned space exploration mini-moons were further examined in a study published in the journal icarusthe earliest known mention in the scientific literature of a temporarily captured orbiter is by clarence chant about the meteor procession of february 9 1913

it would seem that the bodies had been traveling through space probably in an orbit about the sun and that on coming near the earth they were promptly captured by it and caused to move about it as a satellite
and later in 1916 william frederick denning surmised

the large meteors which passed over northern america on february 9 1913 presented some unique features the length of their observed flight was about 2600 miles 4,200 km and they must have been moving in paths concentric or nearly concentric with the earths surface so that they temporarily formed new terrestrial satellites”
it has been proposed that nasa search for temporary natural satellites and use them for a sample return missionin april 2015 an object was discovered orbiting the earth and initially designated 2015 hp116 but more detailed investigation quickly showed the object to be the gaia spacecraft and the objects discovery soon was retractedon october 3 2015 a small object temporarily designated wt1190f was found to be orbiting the earth every 23 days and had been orbiting since at least late 2009 it impacted the earth on november 13 2015 at 061834.3 ±1.3 seconds utc
on february 8 2016 a 0.5-meter object was discovered orbiting the earth with a period of 5 days and given the temporary designation xc83e0d and most likely lost the object was later identified with the lost artificial satellite sr-11a or possibly its companion sr-11b which were launched in 1976 and lost in 1979on april 8 2016 an object given the temporary designation s509356 was discovered with an orbital period of 3.58 days although it has the typical area-to-mass ratio m2kg of satellites it has a color typical of s-type asteroids it was later identified as the yuanzheng-1 stage from the launch of chinese navigation satelliteson december 8 2017 the object yx205b9 was discovered with an orbital period of 21 days on an eccentric orbit taking it from slightly beyond the geocentric satellite ring to almost twice the distance of the moon it was later identified as the booster stage from the change 2 mission


 literature 
the writer jules verne learned of petits 1861 proposal and made use of the idea in his 1865 novel around the moon this fictional moon was not however exactly based on the toulouse observations or petits proposal at a technical level and so the orbit suggested by verne was mathematically incorrect petit died in 1865 and so was not alive to offer a response to vernes fictional moon
