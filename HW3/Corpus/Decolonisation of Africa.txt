the decolonisation of africa took place in the mid-to-late 1950s and 1960s very suddenly with little preparation there was widespread unrest and organised revolts in both northern and sub-saharan colonies especially in french algeria portuguese angola the belgian congo and british kenya


 background 

the scramble for africa between 1870 and 1900 ended with almost all of africa being controlled by a small number of european states racing to secure as much land as possible while avoiding conflict amongst themselves the partition of africa was confirmed in the berlin agreement of 1885 with little regard to local differences by 1905 control of almost all african soil was claimed by western european governments with the only exceptions being liberia which had been settled by african-american former slaves and ethiopia then occupied by italy in 1936 britain and france had the largest holdings but germany spain italy belgium and portugal also had colonies as a result of colonialism and imperialism a majority of africa lost sovereignty and control of natural resources such as gold and rubber the introduction of imperial policies surfacing around local economies led to the failing of local economies due to an exploitation of resources and cheap labor progress towards independence was slow up until the mid-20th century by 1977 54 african countries had seceded from european colonial rulers


 causes 


 external causes 
during the world wars african soldiers were conscripted into imperial militaries this led to a deeper political awareness and the expectation of greater respect and self-determination which was left largely unfulfilled during the 1941 atlantic conference the british and the us leaders met to discuss ideas for the post-war world one of the provisions added by president roosevelt was that all people had the right to self-determination inspiring hope in british colonieson february 12 1941 united states president franklin d roosevelt and british prime minister winston churchill met to discuss the postwar world the result was the atlantic charter it was not a treaty and was not submitted to the british parliament or the senate of the united states for ratification but it turned to be a widely acclaimed document one of the provisions introduced by roosevelt was the autonomy of imperial colonies after world war ii the us and the african colonies put pressure on britain to abide by the terms of the atlantic charter after the war some britons considered african colonies to be childish and immature british colonisers introduced democratic government at local levels in the colonies britain was forced to agree but churchill rejected universal applicability of self-determination for subject nations he also stated that the charter was only applicable to german occupied states not to the british empirefurthermore colonies such as nigeria senegal and ghana pushed for self-governance as colonial powers were exhausted by war efforts


 internal causes 
for early african nationalists decolonization was a moral imperative in 1945 the fifth pan-african congress demanded the end of colonialism delegates included future presidents of ghana kenya malawi and national activistscolonial economic exploitation led to european extraction of ghana’s mining profits to shareholders instead of internal development causing major local socioeconomic grievances nevertheless local african industry and towns expanded when u-boats patrolling the atlantic ocean reduced raw material transportation to europe in turn urban communities industries and trade unions grew improving literacy and education leading to pro-independence newspaper establishmentsindeed in the 1930s the colonial powers had cultivated sometimes inadvertently a small elite of leaders educated in western universities and familiar with ideas such as self-determination in some cases where the road to independence was fought settled arrangements with the colonial powers were also being placed these leaders came to lead the struggles for independence and included leading nationalists such as jomo kenyatta kenya kwame nkrumah gold coast now ghana julius nyerere tanganyika now tanzania léopold sédar senghor senegal nnamdi azikiwe nigeria and félix houphouët-boigny côte divoire


 economic legacy 
the economic legacy of colonialism is difficult to quantify but is likely to have been negative modernisation theory emphasises that colonial powers built infrastructure to integrate africa into the world economy however this was built mainly for extraction purposes african economies were structured to benefit the coloniser and any surplus was likely to be ‘drained’ thereby stifling capital accumulation dependency theory suggests that most african economies continued to occupy a subordinate position in the world economy after independence with a reliance on primary commodities such as copper in zambia and tea in kenya despite this continued reliance and unfair trading terms a meta-analysis of 18 african countries found that a third of countries experienced increased economic growth post-independence


 effects of debt 
the debts of african economies are external and one-sided while the usa and the uk have gross external debts of 95% and 400% respectively these debts are balanced by the countries being major lenders this is not the case for african nations which do not own as many assets or debts to balance the burden the debt situation in sub-saharan africa means that the world’s poorest countries were transferring 3 billion us dollars to developed countries between 1995 and 2000 this is exacerbated by interest and principal arrears which made up over 27% of total external debt for sub-saharan nations in 1998 this causes two main problems firstly servicing the debt means less money is available for importing goods secondly debt creates uncertainty and risk which puts off investors and reduces business confidence


 social legacy 


 language 
over 2,000 distinct languages are spoken in the continent along with africa’s indigenous dialects - afro-asiatic kordofanian and khoisan languages many colonial languages are spoken today for example english is spoken in ghana gambia and kenya french in benin burkina-faso and cameroon and portuguese in guinea-bissau angola são tomé and príncipe scholars including dellal 2013 miraftab 2012 and bamgbose 2011 have argued that africa’s linguistic diversity has been eroded language has been used by western colonial powers to divide territories and create new identities which has led to conflicts and tensions between african nations


 land 
today 93% of south africas land is still owned by ‘descendants of white settlers’ despite the political negotiation of the native land act in 1913 king 1990 argued that ‘space’ is a mode of segregations creating forms of inclusions and exclusions evidence is represented through different architecture designs and distinct segregation of spaces zonification in cities are still a feature in the colonial present for example the new development of the business improvement district in cape town portrays a similar image of the colonial era with embedded struggles in class race ethnicity and hierarchical differences decolonization marks one of the historical moments in which african countries increased its autonomous status from the impetus western colonial powers echoes of the colonial past are still visible in the african society today because ferguson 2006 stated there are still widespread social stigmas associated with the continent such as phrases of ‘darkness’ and ‘troubled’ the representation of africa therefore reveals the continual western legacies of the colonial past and the struggles embedded in the countries


 transition to independence 
following world war ii rapid decolonization swept across the continent of africa as many territories gained their independence from european colonization
in august 1941 united states president franklin d roosevelt and british prime minister winston churchill met to discuss their post-war goals in that meeting they agreed to the atlantic charter which in part stipulated that they would respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live and they wish to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them this agreement became the post-wwii stepping stone toward independence as nationalism grew throughout africaconsumed with post-war debt european powers were no longer able to afford the resources needed to maintain control of their african colonies this allowed for african nationalists to negotiate decolonization very quickly and with minimal casualties some territories however saw great death tolls as a result of their fight for independence


 ghana independence 
on 6 march 1957 ghana formerly the gold coast became the first sub-saharan african country to gain its independence from european colonization in the twentieth centurystarting as early as the 1945 pan-african congress gold coast’s american-educated independence leader kwame nkrumah made his focus clear  in the conference’s declaration he wrote “we believe in the rights of all peoples to govern themselves we affirm the right of all colonial peoples to control their own destiny all colonies must be free from foreign imperialist control whether political or economic”four years later in 1949 the conflict would ramp up when british troops opened fire on african protesters  riots broke out across the territory and while nkrumah and other leaders ended up in prison the event became a catalyst for the independence movement  after being released from prison nkrumah founded the convention people’s party cpp which launched a mass-based campaign for independence with the slogan ‘self government now’” heightened nationalism within the country grew their power and the political party widely expanded  in february of 1951 the convention peoples party gained political power by winning 34 of 38 elected seats including one for nkrumah who was imprisoned at the time  while the movement started with violence it would end with political cooperation


 algerian war for independence 
in algeria anti-colonialism sentiment grew following world war ii until it reached a boiling point unlike many territories that gained their independence through a smooth transition france believed the african colony was important and never met their promise of self-governance in algeria  as a result the front de liberation nationale fln began a guerrilla-style attack to win their freedom lasting more than eight years the estimated death toll typically falls between 300,000 and 400,000 people by 1958 the fln was able to negotiate peace accord with french president charles de gaulle and nearly 90% of all europeans had left the territory
