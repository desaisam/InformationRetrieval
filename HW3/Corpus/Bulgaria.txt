one of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day bulgaria was the neolithic karanovo culture which dates back to 6,500 bc in the 6th to 3rd century bc the region was a battleground for thracians persians celts and ancient macedonians stability came when the roman empire conquered the region in ad 45 the eastern roman or byzantine empire lost some of these territories to an invading bulgar horde in the late 7th century the bulgars founded the first bulgarian empire in ad 681 which dominated most of the balkans and significantly influenced slavic cultures by developing the cyrillic script this state lasted until the early 11th century when byzantine emperor basil ii conquered and dismantled it a successful bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a second bulgarian empire which reached its apex under ivan asen ii 1218–1241 after numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife the second bulgarian empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under ottoman rule for nearly five centuries
the russo-turkish war of 1877–78 resulted in the formation of the current third bulgarian state many ethnic bulgarian populations were left outside its borders which led to several conflicts with its neighbours and an alliance with germany in both world wars in 1946 bulgaria became a one-party socialist state and part of the soviet-led eastern bloc the ruling communist party gave up its monopoly on power after the revolutions of 1989 and allowed multi-party elections bulgaria then transitioned into a democracy and a market-based economy
since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991 the sovereign state has been a unitary parliamentary republic with a high degree of political administrative and economic centralisation the population of seven million lives mainly in sofia and the capital cities of the 27 provinces and the country has suffered significant demographic decline since the late 1980s

 etymology 
the name bulgaria is derived from the bulgars a tribe of turkic origin that founded the country their name is not completely understood and difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century ad but it is possibly derived from the proto-turkic word bulģha to mix shake stir and its derivative bulgak revolt disorder the meaning may be further extended to rebel incite or produce a state of disorder ie the disturbers ethnic groups in inner asia with phonologically similar names were frequently described in similar terms during the 4th century the buluoji a component of the five barbarian groups in ancient china were portrayed as both a mixed race and troublemakers


 history 


 prehistory and antiquity 

neanderthal remains dating to around 150,000 years ago or the middle paleolithic are some of the earliest traces of human activity in the lands of modern bulgaria the karanovo culture arose circa 6,500 bc and was one of several neolithic societies in the region that thrived on agriculture the copper age varna culture fifth millennium bc is credited with inventing gold metallurgy the associated varna necropolis treasure contains the oldest golden jewellery in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years the treasure has been valuable for understanding social hierarchy and stratification in the earliest european societiesthe thracians one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern bulgarians appeared on the balkan peninsula some time before the 12th century bc the thracians excelled in metallurgy and gave the greeks the orphean and dionysian cults but remained tribal and stateless the persian achaemenid empire conquered most of present-day bulgaria in the 6th century bc and retained control over the region until 479 bc the invasion became a catalyst for thracian unity and the bulk of their tribes united under king teres to form the odrysian kingdom in the 470s bc it was weakened and vassalized by philip ii of macedon in 341 bc attacked by celts in the 3rd century and finally became a province of the roman empire in ad 45by the end of the 1st century ad roman governance was established over the entire balkan peninsula and christianity began spreading in the region around the 4th century the gothic bible—the first germanic language book—was created by gothic bishop ulfilas in what is today northern bulgaria around 381 the region came under byzantine control after the fall of rome in 476 the byzantines were engaged in prolonged warfare against persia and could not defend their balkan territories from barbarian incursions this enabled the slavs to enter the balkan peninsula as marauders primarily through an area between the danube river and the balkan mountains known as moesia gradually the interior of the peninsula became a country of the south slavs who lived under a democracy the slavs assimilated the partially hellenized romanized and gothicized thracians in the rural areas


 first bulgarian empire 

not long after the slavic incursion moesia was once again invaded this time by the bulgars under khan asparukh their horde was a remnant of old great bulgaria an extinct tribal confederacy situated north of the black sea in what is now ukraine asparukh attacked byzantine territories in moesia and conquered the slavic tribes there in 680 a peace treaty with the byzantine empire was signed in 681 marking the foundation of the first bulgarian empire the minority bulgars formed a close-knit ruling castesucceeding rulers strengthened the bulgarian state throughout the 8th and 9th centuries krum introduced a written code of law and checked a major byzantine incursion at the battle of pliska in which byzantine emperor nicephorus i was killed boris i abolished paganism in favour of eastern orthodox christianity in 864 the conversion was followed by a byzantine recognition of the bulgarian church and the adoption of the cyrillic alphabet developed in the capital preslav the common language religion and script strengthened central authority and gradually fused the slavs and bulgars into a unified people speaking a single slavic language a golden age began during the 34-year rule of simeon the great who oversaw the largest territorial expansion of the stateafter simeons death bulgaria was weakened by wars with magyars and pechenegs and the spread of the bogomil heresy preslav was seized by the byzantine army in 971 after consecutive rus and byzantine invasions the empire briefly recovered from the attacks under samuil but this ended when byzantine emperor basil ii defeated the bulgarian army at klyuch in 1014 samuil died shortly after the battle and by 1018 the byzantines had conquered the first bulgarian empire


 second bulgarian empire 

after the conquest of bulgaria basil ii prevented revolts by retaining the rule of local nobility and relieving their lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold allowing tax in kind instead the bulgarian patriarchate was reduced to an archbishopric but retained its autocephalous status and its dioceses byzantine domestic policies changed after basils death and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out the largest being led by peter delyan in 1185 asen dynasty nobles ivan asen i and peter iv organized a major uprising which resulted in the re-establishment of the bulgarian state ivan asen and peter laid the foundations of the second bulgarian empire with tarnovo as the capital

kaloyan the third of the asen monarchs extended his dominion to belgrade and ohrid he acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of the pope and received a royal crown from a papal legate the empire reached its zenith under ivan asen ii 1218–1241 when its borders expanded as far as the coast of albania serbia and epirus while commerce and culture flourished ivan asens rule was also marked by a shift away from rome in religious mattersthe asen dynasty became extinct in 1257 internal conflicts and incessant byzantine and hungarian attacks followed enabling the mongols to establish suzerainty over the weakened bulgarian state in 1277 swineherd ivaylo led a great peasant revolt that chased the mongols out of bulgaria and briefly made him emperor he was overthrown in 1280 by the feudal landlords whose factional conflicts caused the second bulgarian empire to disintegrate into small feudal dominions by the 14th century these fragmented rump states—two tsardoms at vidin and tarnovo and the despotate of dobrudzha—became easy prey for a new threat arriving from the southeast the ottoman turks


 ottoman rule 

the ottomans were employed as mercenaries by the byzantines in the 1340s but later became invaders in their own right sultan murad i took adrianople from the byzantines in 1362 sofia fell in 1382 followed by shumen in 1388 the ottomans completed their conquest of bulgarian lands in 1393 when tarnovo was sacked after a three-month siege and the battle of nicopolis which brought about the fall of the vidin tsardom in 1396 sozopol was the last bulgarian settlement to fall in 1453 the bulgarian nobility was subsequently eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to ottoman masters while much of the educated clergy fled to other countrieschristians were considered an inferior class of people under the ottoman system bulgarians were subjected to heavy taxes including devshirme or blood tax their culture was suppressed and they experienced partial islamisation ottoman authorities established a religious administrative community called the rum millet which governed all orthodox christians regardless of their ethnicity most of the local population then gradually lost its distinct national consciousness identifying only by its faith the clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept their ethnic identity alive enabling its survival in remote rural areas and in the militant catholic community in the northwest of the countryas ottoman power began to wane habsburg austria and russia saw bulgarian christians as potential allies the austrians first backed an uprising in tarnovo in 1598 then a second one in 1686 the chiprovtsi uprising in 1688 and finally karposhs rebellion in 1689 the russian empire also asserted itself as a protector of christians in ottoman lands with the treaty of küçük kaynarca in 1774

the western european enlightenment in the 18th century influenced the initiation of a national awakening of bulgaria it restored national consciousness and provided an ideological basis for the liberation struggle resulting in the 1876 april uprising up to 30,000 bulgarians were killed as ottoman authorities put down the rebellion the massacres prompted the great powers to take action they convened the constantinople conference in 1876 but their decisions were rejected by the ottomans this allowed the russian empire to seek a military solution without risking confrontation with other great powers as had happened in the crimean war in 1877 russia declared war on the ottomans and defeated them with the help of bulgarian rebels particularly during the crucial battle of shipka pass which secured russian control over the main road to constantinople


 third bulgarian state 

the treaty of san stefano was signed on 3 march 1878 by russia and the ottoman empire it was to set up an autonomous bulgarian principality spanning moesia macedonia and thrace roughly on the territories of the second bulgarian empire and this day is now a public holiday called national liberation day the other great powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the balkans might threaten their interests it was superseded by the treaty of berlin signed on 13 july which provided for a much smaller state only comprising moesia and the region of sofia leaving large populations of ethnic bulgarians outside the new country this significantly contributed to bulgarias militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th centurythe bulgarian principality won a war against serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous ottoman territory of eastern rumelia in 1885 proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 october 1908 in the years following independence bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as the balkan prussia it became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918—two balkan wars and world war i after a disastrous defeat in the second balkan war bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the central powers in world war i despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at doiran and monastir the country capitulated in 1918 the war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed more than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories immigrated to bulgaria from 1912 to 1929 placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy

the resulting political unrest led to the establishment of a royal authoritarian dictatorship by tsar boris iii 1918–1943 bulgaria entered world war ii in 1941 as a member of the axis but declined to participate in operation barbarossa and saved its jewish population from deportation to concentration camps the sudden death of boris iii in mid-1943 pushed the country into political turmoil as the war turned against germany and the communist guerrilla movement gained momentum the government of bogdan filov subsequently failed to achieve peace with the allies bulgaria did not comply with soviet demands to expel german forces from its territory resulting in a declaration of war and an invasion by the ussr in september 1944 the communist-dominated fatherland front took power ended participation in the axis and joined the allied side until the war ended bulgaria suffered little war damage and the soviet union demanded no reparations but all wartime gains with the notable exception of southern dobrudzha were lostthe left-wing uprising of 9 september 1944 led to the abolition of the monarchy and the executions of some 1,000–3,000 dissidents war criminals and members of the former royal elite but it was not until 1946 that a one-party peoples republic was instituted following a referendum it fell into the soviet sphere of influence under the leadership of georgi dimitrov 1946–1949 who established a repressive rapidly industrializing stalinist state by the mid-1950s standards of living rose significantly and political repressions eased the soviet-style planned economy saw some market-oriented policies emerging on an experimental level under todor zhivkov 1954–1989 compared to wartime levels national gdp increased five-fold and per capita gdp quadrupled by the 1980s although severe debt spikes took place in 1960 1977 and 1980 zhivkovs daughter lyudmila bolstered national pride by promoting bulgarian heritage culture and arts worldwide facing declining birth rates among the ethnic bulgarian majority in 1984 zhivkovs government forced the minority ethnic turks to adopt slavic names in an attempt to erase their identity and assimilate them these policies resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 ethnic turks to turkeythe communist party was forced to give up its political monopoly on 10 november 1989 under the influence of the revolutions of 1989 zhivkov resigned and bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy the first free elections in june 1990 were won by the communist party now rebranded as the bulgarian socialist party a new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in july 1991 the new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth—the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s after 2001 economic political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly and bulgaria achieved high human development status in 2003 it became a member of nato in 2004 and participated in the war in afghanistan after several years of reforms it joined the european union and single market in 2007 despite brussels concerns about government corruption bulgaria hosted the 2018 presidency of the council of the european union at the national palace of culture in sofia

the balkan mountains run laterally through the middle of the country the mountainous southwest has two distinct alpine ranges—rila and pirin which border the lower but more extensive rhodope mountains to the east musala at 2,925 metres 9,596 ft is the highest point in both bulgaria and the balkan peninsula and the black sea coast is the countrys lowest point plains occupy about one third of the territory while plateaux and hills occupy 41 most rivers are short and with low water levels the longest river located solely in bulgarian territory the iskar has a length of 368 kilometres 229 mi other major rivers include the struma and the maritsa in the southbulgaria has a changeable climate which results from being positioned at the meeting point of the mediterranean and continental air masses combined with the barrier effect of its mountains northern bulgaria averages 1 °c 1.8 °f cooler and registers 200 millimetres 7.9 in more precipitation than the regions south of the balkan mountains temperature amplitudes vary significantly in different areas the lowest recorded temperature is −38.3 °c −36.9 °f while the highest is 45.2 °c 113.4 °f precipitation averages about 630 millimetres 24.8 in per year and varies from 500 millimetres 19.7 in in dobrudja to more than 2,500 millimetres 98.4 in in the mountains continental air masses bring significant amounts of snowfall during winter


 biodiversity and environment 

the interaction of climatic hydrological geological and topographical conditions has produced a relatively wide variety of plant and animal species
bulgarias biodiversity one of the richest in europe is conserved in three national parks 11 nature parks 10 biosphere reserves and 565 protected areas ninety-three of the 233 mammal species of europe are found in bulgaria along with 49% of butterfly and 30% of vascular plant species overall 41,493 plant and animal species are present larger mammals with sizable populations include deer 106,323 individuals wild boars 88,948 jackals 47,293 and foxes 32,326 partridges number some 328,000 individuals making them the most widespread gamebird a third of all nesting birds in bulgaria can be found in rila national park which also hosts arctic and alpine species at high altitudes flora includes more than 3,800 vascular plant species of which 170 are endemic and 150 are considered endangered a checklist of larger fungi in bulgaria by the institute of botany identifies more than 1,500 species more than 35% of the land area is covered by forestsin 1998 the bulgarian government adopted the national biological diversity conservation strategy a comprehensive programme seeking the preservation of local ecosystems protection of endangered species and conservation of genetic resources bulgaria has some of the largest natura 2000 areas in europe covering 33.8% of its territory it also achieved its kyoto protocol objective of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 30% from 1990 to 2009bulgaria ranks 30th in the 2018 environmental performance index but scores low on air quality particulate levels are the highest in europe especially in urban areas affected by automobile traffic and coal-based power stations one of these the lignite-fired maritsa iztok-2 station is causing the highest damage to health and the environment in the european union pesticide use in agriculture and antiquated industrial sewage systems produce extensive soil and water pollution water quality began to improve in 1998 and has maintained a trend of moderate improvement over 75% of surface rivers meet european standards for good quality


 politics
