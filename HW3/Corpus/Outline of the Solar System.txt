the following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the solar system
solar system –  gravitationally bound system comprising the sun and the objects that orbit it either directly or indirectly of those objects that orbit the sun directly the largest eight are the planets including earth with the remainder being significantly smaller objects such as dwarf planets and small solar system bodies of the objects that orbit the sun indirectly the moons two are larger than the smallest planet mercury
