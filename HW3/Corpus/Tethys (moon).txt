tethys or saturn iii is a mid-sized moon of saturn about 1,060 km 660 mi across it was discovered by g d cassini in 1684 and is named after the titan tethys of greek mythology
tethys has a low density of 0.98 gcm3 the lowest of all the major moons in the solar system indicating that it is made of water ice with just a small fraction of rock this is confirmed by the spectroscopy of its surface which identified water ice as the dominant surface material a small amount of an unidentified dark material is present as well the surface of tethys is very bright being the second-brightest of the moons of saturn after enceladus and neutral in color
tethys is heavily cratered and cut by a number of large faultsgraben the largest impact crater odysseus is about 400 km in diameter whereas the largest graben ithaca chasma is about 100 km wide and more than 2000 km long these two largest surface features may be related a small part of the surface is covered by smooth plains that may be cryovolcanic in origin like all other regular moons of saturn tethys formed from the saturnian sub-nebula—a disk of gas and dust that surrounded saturn soon after its formation
tethys has been approached by several space probes including pioneer 11 1979 voyager 1 1980 voyager 2 1981 and multiple times by cassini since 2004


 discovery and naming 
tethys was discovered by giovanni domenico cassini in 1684 together with dione another moon of saturn he had also discovered two moons rhea and iapetus earlier in 1671–72 cassini observed all of these moons using a large aerial telescope he set up on the grounds of the paris observatorycassini named the four new moons as sidera lodoicea the stars of louis to honour king louis xiv of france by the end of the seventeenth century astronomers fell into the habit of referring to them and titan as saturn i through saturn v tethys dione rhea titan iapetus once mimas and enceladus were discovered in 1789 the numbering scheme was extended to saturn vii by bumping the older five moons up two slots the discovery of hyperion in 1848 changed the numbers one last time bumping iapetus up to saturn viii henceforth the numbering scheme would remain fixed
the modern names of all seven satellites of saturn come from john herschel son of william herschel discoverer of mimas and enceladus in his 1847 publication results of astronomical observations made at the cape of good hope he suggested the names of the titans sisters and brothers of kronos the greek analogue of saturn be used
tethys is named after the titaness tethys of greek mythology it is also designated saturn iii or s iii tethys the correct adjectival form of the moons name is tethyan although other forms are also used


 orbit 
tethys orbits saturn at a distance of about 295,000 km about 4.4 saturns radii from the center of the planet its orbital eccentricity is negligible and its orbital inclination is about 1° tethys is locked in an inclination resonance with mimas however due to the low gravity of the respective bodies this interaction does not cause any noticeable orbital eccentricity or tidal heatingthe tethyan orbit lies deep inside the magnetosphere of saturn so the plasma co-rotating with the planet strikes the trailing hemisphere of the moon tethys is also subject to constant bombardment by the energetic particles electrons and ions present in the magnetospheretethys has two co-orbital moons telesto and calypso orbiting near tethyss trojan points l4 60° ahead and l5 60° behind respectively


 physical characteristics 

tethys is the 16th-largest moon in the solar system with a radius of 531 km its mass is 6.17×1020 kg0.000103 earth mass which is less than 1% of the moon  the density of tethys is 0.98 gcm³ indicating that it is composed almost entirely of water-iceit is not known whether tethys is differentiated into a rocky core and ice mantle however if it is differentiated the radius of the core does not exceed 145 km and its mass is below 6% of the total mass due to the action of tidal and rotational forces tethys has the shape of triaxial ellipsoid the dimensions of this ellipsoid are consistent with it having a homogeneous interior the existence of a subsurface ocean—a layer of liquid salt water in the interior of tethys—is considered unlikelythe surface of tethys is one of the most reflective at visual wavelengths in the solar system with a visual albedo of 1.229 this very high albedo is the result of the sandblasting of particles from saturns e-ring a faint ring composed of small water-ice particles generated by enceladuss south polar geysers the radar albedo of the tethyan surface is also very high the leading hemisphere of tethys is brighter by 10–15% than the trailing onethe high albedo indicates that the surface of tethys is composed of almost pure water ice with only a small amount of darker materials the visible spectrum of tethys is flat and featureless whereas in the near-infrared strong water ice absorption bands at 1.25 1.5 2.0 and 3.0 μm wavelengths are visible no compound other than crystalline water ice has been unambiguously identified on tethys possible constituents include organics ammonia and carbon dioxide the dark material in the ice has the same spectral properties as seen on the surfaces of the dark saturnian moons—iapetus and hyperion the most probable candidate is nanophase iron or hematite measurements of the thermal emission as well as radar observations by the cassini spacecraft show that the icy regolith on the surface of tethys is structurally complex and has a large porosity exceeding 95


 surface features 


 color patterns 

the surface of tethys has a number of large-scale features distinguished by their color and sometimes brightness the trailing hemisphere gets increasingly red and dark as the anti-apex of motion is approached this darkening is responsible for the hemispheric albedo asymmetry mentioned above the leading hemisphere also reddens slightly as the apex of the motion is approached although without any noticeable darkening such a bifurcated color pattern results in the existence of a bluish band between hemispheres following a great circle that runs through the poles this coloration and darkening of the tethyan surface is typical for saturnian middle-sized satellites its origin may be related to a deposition of bright ice particles from the e-ring onto the leading hemispheres and dark particles coming from outer satellites on the trailing hemispheres the darkening of the trailing hemispheres can also be caused by the impact of plasma from the magnetosphere of saturn which co-rotates with the planeton the leading hemisphere of tethys spacecraft observations have found a dark bluish band spanning 20° to the south and north from the equator the band has an elliptical shape getting narrower as it approaches the trailing hemisphere a comparable band exists only on mimas the band is almost certainly caused by the influence of energetic electrons from the saturnian magnetosphere with energies greater than about 1 mev these particles drift in the direction opposite to the rotation of the planet and preferentially impact areas on the leading hemisphere close to the equator  temperature maps of tethys obtained by cassini have shown this bluish region is cooler at midday than surrounding areas giving the satellite a pac-man-like appearance at mid-infrared wavelengths


 geology 
the surface of tethys mostly consists of hilly cratered terrain dominated by craters more than 40 km in diameter a smaller portion of the surface is represented by the smooth plains on the trailing hemisphere there are also a number of tectonic features such as chasmata and troughs

the western part of the leading hemisphere of tethys is dominated by a large impact crater called odysseus whose 450 km diameter is nearly 2/5 of that of tethys itself the crater is now quite flat - more precisely its floor conforms to tethyss spherical shape this is most likely due to the viscous relaxation of the tethyan icy crust over geologic time nevertheless the rim crest of odysseus is elevated by approximately 5 km above the mean satellite radius the central complex of odysseus features a central pit 2–4 km deep surrounded by massifs elevated by 6–9 km above the crater floor which itself is about 3 km below the average radiusthe second major feature seen on tethys is a huge valley called ithaca chasma about 100 km wide and 3 km deep it is more than 2000 km in length approximately 3/4 of the way around tethys circumference ithaca chasma occupies about 10% of the surface of tethys it is approximately concentric with odysseus—a pole of ithaca chasma lies only approximately 20° from the crater

it is thought that ithaca chasma formed as tethyss internal liquid water solidified causing the moon to expand and cracking the surface to accommodate the extra volume within the subsurface ocean may have resulted from a 23 orbital resonance between dione and tethys early in the solar systems history that led to orbital eccentricity and tidal heating of tethyss interior the ocean would have frozen after the moons escaped from the resonance there is another theory about the formation of ithaca chasma when the impact that caused the great crater odysseus occurred the shock wave traveled through tethys and fractured the icy brittle surface in this case ithaca chasma would be the outermost ring graben of odysseus however age determination based on crater counts in high-resolution cassini images showed that ithaca chasma is older than odysseus making the impact hypothesis unlikelythe smooth plains on the trailing hemisphere are approximately antipodal to odysseus although they extend about 60° to the northeast from the exact antipode the plains have a relatively sharp boundary with the surrounding cratered terrain the location of this unit near odysseus antipode argues for a connection between the crater and plains the latter can be a result of focusing the seismic waves produced by the impact in the center of the opposite hemisphere however the smooth appearance of the plains together with their sharp boundaries impact shaking would have produced a wide transitional zone indicates that they formed by endogenic intrusion possibly along the lines of weakness in the tethyan lithosphere created by odysseus impact


 impact craters and chronology 
the majority of tethyan impact craters are of a simple central peak type those more than 150 km in diameter show more complex peak ring morphology only odysseus crater has a central depression resembling a central pit older impact craters are somewhat shallower than young ones implying a degree of relaxationthe density of impact craters varies across the surface of tethys the higher the crater density the older the surface this allows scientists to establish a relative chronology for tethys the cratered terrain is the oldest unit likely dating back to the solar system formation 4.56 billion years ago the youngest unit lies within odysseus crater with an estimated age from 3.76 to 1.06 billion years depending on the absolute chronology used ithaca chasma is older than odysseus


 origin and evolution 

tethys is thought to have formed from an accretion disc or subnebula a disc of gas and dust that existed around saturn for some time after its formation the low temperature at the position of saturn in the solar nebular means that water ice was the primary solid from which all moons formed other more volatile compounds like ammonia and carbon dioxide were likely present as well though their abundances are not well constrainedthe extremely water-ice-rich composition of tethys remains unexplained the conditions in the saturnian sub-nebula likely favored conversion of the molecular nitrogen and carbon monoxide into ammonia and methane respectively this can partially explain why saturnian moons including tethys contain more water ice than outer solar system bodies like pluto or triton as the oxygen freed from carbon monoxide would react with the hydrogen forming water one of the most interesting explanations proposed is that the rings and inner moons accreted from the tidally stripped ice-rich crust of a titan-like moon before it was swallowed by saturnthe accretion process probably lasted for several thousand years before the moon was fully formed models suggest that impacts accompanying accretion caused heating of tethyss outer layer reaching a maximum temperature of around 155 k at a depth of about 29 km after the end of formation due to thermal conduction the subsurface layer cooled and the interior heated up the cooling near-surface layer contracted and the interior expanded this caused strong extensional stresses in tethyss crust reaching estimates of 5.7 mpa which likely led to crackingbecause tethys lacks substantial rock content the heating by decay of radioactive elements is unlikely to have played a significant role in its further evolution this also means that tethys may have never experienced any significant melting unless its interior was heated by tides they may have occurred for instance during the passage of tethys through an orbital resonance with dione or some other moon still present knowledge of the evolution of tethys is very limited


 exploration 

pioneer 11 flew by saturn in 1979 and its closest approach to tethys was 329,197 km on 1 september 1979one year later on 12 november 1980 voyager 1 flew 415,670 km from tethys its twin spacecraft voyager 2 passed as close as 93,010 km from the moon on 26 august 1981 although both spacecraft took images of tethys the resolution of voyager 1s images did not exceed 15 km and only those obtained by voyager 2 had a resolution as high as 2 km the first geological feature discovered in 1980 by voyager 1 was ithaca chasma later in 1981 voyager 2 revealed that it almost circled the moon running for 270° voyager 2 also discovered the odysseus crater tethys was the most fully imaged saturnian satellite by the voyagers

the cassini spacecraft entered orbit around saturn in 2004 during its primary mission from june 2004 through june 2008 it performed one very close targeted flyby of tethys on 24 september 2005 at the distance of 1503 km in addition to this flyby the spacecraft performed many non-targeted flybys during its primary and equinox missions since 2004 at distances of tens of thousands of kilometersanother flyby of tethys took place on 14 august 2010 during the solstice mission at a distance of 38,300 km when the fourth-largest crater on tethys penelope which is 207 km wide was imaged more non-targeted flybys are planned for the solstice mission in 2011–2017cassinis observations allowed high-resolution maps of tethys to be produced with the resolution of 0.29 km the spacecraft obtained spatially resolved near-infrared spectra of tethys showing that its surface is made of water ice mixed with a dark material whereas the far-infrared observations constrained the bolometric bond albedo the radar observations at the wavelength of 2.2 cm showed that the ice regolith has a complex structure and is very porous the observations of plasma in the vicinity of tethys demonstrated that it is a geologically dead body producing no new plasma in the saturnian magnetospherefuture missions to tethys and the saturn system are uncertain but one possibility is the titan saturn system mission
