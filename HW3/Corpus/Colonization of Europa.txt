europa the fourth-largest moon of jupiter is a subject in both science fiction and scientific speculation for future human colonization europas geophysical features including a possible subglacial water ocean make it a possibility that human life could be sustained on or beneath the surface


 feasibility 
europa as a target for human colonization has several benefits compared to other bodies in the outer solar system but is not without challenges


 possible advantages 
europa is thought to have a liquid water ocean underneath its icy exterior access to this liquid water ocean is a major difficulty but the abundance of water on europa is a benefit to any considerations for colonization not only can water provide for colonists drinking needs it also can be broken down to provide breathable oxygen oxygen is also believed to have accumulated from radiolysis of the ice on the surface that has been convected into the subsurface ocean and may prove sufficient for oxygen-using marine life


 possible problems 
the colonization of europa presents numerous difficulties one is the high level of radiation from jupiters radiation belt which is about 10 times as strong as earths van allen radiation belts europa receives 5.4 sv 540 rem of radiation per day which is approximately 1,800 times the average annual yearly dose of a human on earth at sea level  humans exposed to this level of radiation for one day would have greater than 50% mortality rate within 30 days   consequently a human would require significant radiation shielding to survive at or near the surface of europa colonists on europa would have to descend beneath the surface when europa is not protected by jupiters magnetotail and stay in subsurface habitats this would allow colonists to use europas ice sheet to shield themselves from radiation
another problem is that the surface temperature of europa normally rests at −170 °c 103 k −274 °f however the fact that liquid water is believed to exist below europas icy surface along with the likelihood that colonists would spend much of their time under the ice sheet in order to shield themselves from radiation may somewhat mitigate the problems associated with low surface temperatures
the low gravity of europa may also present challenges to colonization efforts the effects of low gravity on human health are still an active field of study but can include symptoms such as loss of bone density loss of muscle density and a weakened immune system astronauts in earth orbit have remained in microgravity for up to a year and more at a time effective countermeasures for the negative effects of low gravity are well-established particularly an aggressive regimen of daily physical exercise the variation in the negative effects of low gravity as a function of different levels of low gravity are not known since all research in this area is restricted to humans in zero gravity the same goes for the potential effects of low gravity on fetal and pediatric development it has been hypothesized that children born and raised in low gravity would not be well adapted for life under the higher gravity of earthit is also speculated that alien organisms may exist on europa possibly in the water underlying the moons ice shell if this is true human colonists may come into conflict with harmful microbes more recent studies have indicated that the action of solar radiation on the surface of europa might produce oxygen which could be pulled down into the subsurface ocean by upwellings of the interior if this process occurs europas subsurface ocean could have an oxygen content equal to or greater than that of the earthsan unstable surface could represent another potential problem it has been shown that the moon is geologically active with an outer crust showing plate tectonics which resembles that on earth the reconstruction of the geological activity over a few years of an area the size of the state alabama showed that a piece of the surface as big as massachusetts had moved down underneath the crust and disappeared


 artemis project colonization plan 
in 1997 the artemis project produced a plan to colonize europa according to this plan explorers would first establish a small base on the surface from there they would drill down into the europan ice crust entering the postulated subsurface ocean the colonists would then create or possibly find a pocket between the icy surface and the liquid interior in which to establish a base this location would be protected from radiation by the ice overhead and would be at a more human-suitable temperature than the surface as indicated by the presence of liquid water


 in fiction 
europa plays a role in the book and film of arthur c clarkes 2010 odyssey two and its sequels super-advanced aliens aiding the development of life take an interest in the primitive life forms under europas ice they transform jupiter into a star to kick-start their evolution and forbid humans from landing on or colonizing europa in 2061 odyssey three europa has become a tropical ocean world
in bruce sterlings novel schismatrix europa is inhabited by genetically engineered posthumans
alastair reynoldss short story a spy in europa depicts an advanced human society called the demarchists who are based in colonies on europa that mainly cling to the underside of the ice crust at the surface of the ocean a race of genetically altered humans adapted to live in the subsurface ocean is also created some of whom later appear in reynoldss 2006 short story grafenwalders bestiary
europa is one of multiple satellites that is colonized in the japanese animation cowboy bebop along with io ganymede callisto and titan
in call of duty infinite warfare europa houses a military installation used as a black site for weapons development
in warframe europa is under the alignment of the corpus faction it is depicted as an ice-covered planetoid and mining efforts by the corpus are aided with machines and heat generators in open areas it is also home to several black sites for creation of prototype weapon systems like the raptors and other advanced robotic proxies
