 overview 

the queen of new zealand represented by the governor-general of new zealand is head of state throughout the realm of new zealand the exact scope of the realm is defined by the 1983 letters patent constituting the office of governor-general it constitutes one of 16 realms within the commonwealth
the cook islands and niue became new zealands first pacific colonies in 1901 and then protectorates from 1965 the cook islands were self-governing so was niue from 1974 tokelau came under new zealand control in 1925 and remains a non-self-governing territorythe ross dependency comprises that sector of the antarctic continent between 160° east and 150 west longitude together with the islands lying between those degrees of longitude and south of latitude 60 the british imperial government took possession of this territory in 1923 and entrusted it to the administration of new zealand neither russia nor the united states recognises this claim and the matter is left unresolved along with all other antarctic claims by the antarctic treaty which serves to mostly smooth over these differences it is largely uninhabited apart from scientific bases
new zealand citizenship law treats all parts of the realm equally so most people born in new zealand the cook islands niue tokelau and the ross dependency before 2006 are new zealand citizens further conditions apply for those born from 2006 onwards


 governor-general 

a governor-general represents the head of state—elizabeth ii in her capacity as queen of new zealand—in the area of the realm essentially governors-general take on all the dignities and reserve powers of the head of state dame patsy reddy was appointed to assume the position on 14 september 2016


 sovereignty within the realm 


 cook islands and niue 

both the cook islands and niue are self-governing states in free association with new zealand the details of their free association arrangement are contained in several documents such as their respective constitutions the 1983 exchange of letters between the governments of new zealand and the cook islands and the 2001 joint centenary declaration as such the new zealand parliament is not empowered to unilaterally pass legislation in respect of these states in foreign affairs and defence issues new zealand acts on behalf of these countries but only with their advice and consent
as the governor-general is resident in new zealand the cook islands constitution provides for the distinct position of queens representative this individual is not subordinate to the governor-general and acts as the local representative of the queen in right of new zealand since 2013 tom marsters is the queens representative to the cook islands marsters was preceded by sir frederick tutu goodwin this arrangement effectively allows for the de facto independent actions of internal and most external areas of governance
according to niues constitution of 1974 the governor-general of new zealand acts as the queens representative and exercises the executive authority vested in the crownin the cook islands and niue the new zealand high commissioner is the diplomatic representative from new zealand john carter since 2011 is the new zealand high commissioner to the cook islands mark blumsky was the new zealand high commissioner to niue from 2010 until he was replaced by ross ardern in early 2014
despite their close relationship to new zealand both the cook islands and niue maintain some diplomatic relations in their own name both countries maintain high commissions in new zealand and have new zealand high commissioners resident in their capitals in commonwealth practice high commissioners represent their governments not the head of state


 new zealand 
new zealand is a sovereign state at the united nations the country is identified in the general assembly as simply new zealand not as the realm of new zealandnew zealand proper consists of the following island groups
the north island south island and neighbouring coastal islands all contained within the 16 regions of new zealand
the chatham islands to the east contained within the chatham islands territory
the kermadec islands and the three kings islands  to the north and new zealand subantarctic islands to the south all outside local authority boundaries and inhabited only by a small number of research and conservation staff
the ross dependency which forms part of antarctica it is constitutionally part of new zealand however application of sovereignty within the dependency is subsequent upon the enforcement of terms found within the antarctic treaty


 tokelau 
tokelau has a lesser degree of self-government than the cook islands and niue and had been moving toward free association status new zealands representative in tokelau is the administrator of tokelau and has the power to overturn rules passed by the general fono parliament in referenda conducted in 2006 and  2007 by new zealand at the united nations request the people of tokelau failed to reach the two-thirds majority necessary to attain a system of governance with equal powers to that of niue and the cook islands


 future of the realm 
within new zealand there exists some support for a new zealand republic should new zealand become a republic it will retain the ross dependency and tokelau as dependent territories and the realm of new zealand would continue to exist without new zealand the ross dependency and tokelau this would not be a legal hurdle to a new zealand republic as such and both the cook islands and niue would retain their free association with new zealand  however a new zealand republic would present the issue of independence to the cook islands and niue thus a number of options for the future of the realm of new zealand exist should new zealand become a republic

a new zealand republic with the cook islands and niue remaining in free association with new zealand but retaining the queen as their head of state
a new zealand republic with the cook islands and niue having a new republican head of state as their head of state and becoming independent states
a new zealand republic with the cook islands and niue having their own heads of state but retaining their status of free association with new zealand
