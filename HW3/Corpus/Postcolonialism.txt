postcolonialism or postcolonial studies is the academic study of the cultural legacy of colonialism and imperialism focusing on the human consequences of the control and exploitation of colonized people and their lands 
the name postcolonialism is modeled on postmodernism with which it shares certain concepts and methods and may be thought of as a reaction to or departure from colonialism in the same way postmodernism is a reaction to modernism the ambiguous term colonialism may refer either to a system of government or to an ideology or world view underlying that system—in general postcolonialism represents an ideological response to colonialist thought rather than simply describing a system that comes after colonialism the term postcolonial studies may be preferred for this reason
postcolonialism encompasses a wide variety of approaches and theoreticians may not always agree on a common set of definitions on a simple level it may seek through anthropological study to build a better understanding of colonial life from the point of view of the colonized people based on the assumption that the colonial rulers are unreliable narrators
on a deeper level postcolonialism examines the social and political power relationships that sustain colonialism and neocolonialism including the social political and cultural narratives surrounding the colonizer and the colonized this approach may overlap with contemporary history and critical theory and may also draw examples from history political science philosophy sociology anthropology and human geography
sub-disciplines of postcolonial studies examine the effects of colonial rule on the practice of feminism anarchism literature and christian thought


 purpose and basic concepts 
as an epistemology the study of knowledge its nature and verifiability as an ethics moral philosophy and as a politics affairs of the citizenry the field of postcolonialism addresses the politics of knowledge—the matters that constitute the postcolonial identity of a decolonized people which derives from i the colonizers generation of cultural knowledge about the colonized people and ii how that western cultural knowledge was applied to subjugate a non–european people into a colony of the european mother country which after initial invasion was effected by means of the cultural identities of colonizer and colonizedpostcolonialism is aimed at destabilizing these theories intellectual and linguistic social and economic by means of which colonialists perceive understand and know the world postcolonial theory thus establishes intellectual spaces for subaltern peoples to speak for themselves in their own voices and thus produce cultural discourses of philosophy language society and economy balancing the imbalanced us-and-them binary power-relationship between the colonist and the colonial subjects


 colonialist discourse 

colonialism was presented as the extension of civilization which ideologically justified the self-ascribed racial and cultural superiority of the western world over the non-western world this concept was espoused by joseph-ernest renan in la réforme intellectuelle et morale 1871 whereby imperial stewardship was thought to affect the intellectual and moral reformation of the coloured peoples of the lesser cultures of the world that such a divinely established natural harmony among the human races of the world would be possible because everyone has an assigned cultural identity a social place and an economic role within an imperial colony thus

the regeneration of the inferior or degenerate races by the superior races is part of the providential order of things for humanity    regere imperio populos is our vocation pour forth this all-consuming activity onto countries which like china are crying aloud for foreign conquest turn the adventurers who disturb european society into a ver sacrum a horde like those of the franks the lombards or the normans and every man will be in his right role nature has made a race of workers the chinese race who have wonderful manual dexterity and almost no sense of honour govern them with justice levying from them in return for the blessing of such a government an ample allowance for the conquering race and they will be satisfied a race of tillers of the soil the negro treat him with kindness and humanity and all will be as it should a race of masters and soldiers the european race    let each do what he is made for and all will be well

from the mid- to the late-nineteenth century such racialist group-identity language was the cultural common-currency justifying geopolitical competition amongst the european and american empires and meant to protect their over-extended economies especially in the colonization of the far east and in the late-nineteenth century scramble for africa the representation of a homogeneous european identity justified colonization hence belgium and britain and france and germany proffered theories of national superiority that justified colonialism as delivering the light of civilization to unenlightened peoples notably la mission civilisatrice the self-ascribed civilizing mission of the french empire proposed that some races and cultures have a higher purpose in life whereby the more powerful more developed and more civilized races have the right to colonize other peoples in service to the noble idea of civilization and its economic benefits


 postcolonial identity 
decolonized people develop a postcolonial identity that is based on cultural interactions between different identities cultural national and ethnic as well as gender and class based which are assigned varying degrees of social power by the colonial society in postcolonial literature the anti-conquest narrative analyzes the identity politics that are the social and cultural perspectives of the subaltern colonial subjects—their creative resistance to the culture of the colonizer how such cultural resistance complicated the establishment of a colonial society how the colonizers developed their postcolonial identity and how neocolonialism actively employs the us-and-them binary social relation to view the non-western world as inhabited by the other
the neocolonial discourse of geopolitical homogeneity relegating the decolonized peoples their cultures and their countries to an imaginary place such as the third world an over-inclusive term that usually comprises continents and seas ie africa asia latin america and oceania the postcolonial critique analyzes the self-justifying discourse of neocolonialism and the functions philosophic and political of its over-inclusive terms to establish the factual and cultural inaccuracy of homogeneous concepts such as the arabs and the first world christendom and the ummah actually comprise heterogeneous peoples cultures and geography and that accurate descriptions of the worlds peoples places and things require nuanced and accurate terms


 difficulty of definition 
as a contemporary-history term postcolonialism occasionally is applied temporally to denote the immediate time after colonialism which is a problematic application of the term because the immediate historical political time is not included in the categories of critical identity-discourse which deals with over-inclusive terms of cultural representation which are abrogated and replaced by postcolonial criticism as such the terms postcolonial and postcolonialism denote aspects of the subject matter which indicate that the decolonized world is an intellectual space of contradictions of half-finished processes of confusions of hybridity and of liminalitiesin post-colonial drama theory practice politics 1996 helen gilbert and joanne tompkins clarified the denotational functions among which

the term post-colonialism—according to a too-rigid etymology—is frequently misunderstood as a temporal concept meaning the time after colonialism has ceased or the time following the politically determined independence day on which a country breaks away from its governance by another state not a naïve teleological sequence which supersedes colonialism post-colonialism is rather an engagement with and contestation of colonialisms discourses power structures and social hierarchies    a theory of post-colonialism must then respond to more than the merely chronological construction of post-independence and to more than just the discursive experience of imperialism

the term post-colonialism is also applied to denote the mother countrys neocolonial control of the decolonized country effected by the legalistic continuation of the economic cultural and linguistic power relationships that controlled the colonial politics of knowledge the generation production and distribution of knowledge about the colonized peoples of the non–western world the cultural and religious assumptions of colonialist logic remain active practices in contemporary society and are the basis of the mother countrys neocolonial attitude towards her former colonial subjects—an economical source of labour and raw materials


 notable theoreticians 


 frantz fanon 
in the wretched of the earth 1961 the psychiatrist and philosopher frantz fanon analyzed and medically described the nature of colonialism as essentially destructive its societal effects—the imposition of a subjugating colonial identity—are harmful to the mental health of the native peoples who were subjugated into colonies fanon wrote the ideological essence of colonialism is the systematic denial of all attributes of humanity of the colonized people such dehumanization is achieved with physical and mental violence by which the colonist means to inculcate a servile mentality upon the natives for fanon the natives must violently resist colonial subjugation hence fanon describes violent resistance to colonialism as a mentally cathartic practice which purges colonial servility from the native psyche and restores self-respect to the subjugated thus fanon actively supported and participated in the algerian revolution 1954–62 for independence from france as a member and representative of the front de libération nationaleas postcolonial praxis fanons mental-health analyses of colonialism and imperialism and the supporting economic theories were partly derived from the essay imperialism the highest stage of capitalism 1916 wherein vladimir lenin described colonial imperialism as a degenerate form of capitalism which requires greater degrees of human exploitation to ensure continually consistent profit for investment


 edward said 
cultural critic edward said is considered by e san juan jr as the originator and inspiring patron-saint of postcolonial theory and discourse due to his theory of orientalism explained in his 1978 book of the same name to describe the us-and-them binary social relation with which western europe intellectually divided the world—into the occident and the orient— said developed the denotations and connotations of the term orientalism an art-history term for western depictions and the study of the orient saids concept which he also termed orientalism is that the cultural representations generated with the us-and-them binary relation are social constructs which are mutually constitutive and cannot exist independent of each other because each exists on account of and for the othernotably the west created the cultural concept of the east which according to said allowed the europeans to suppress the peoples of the middle east of the indian subcontinent and of asia from expressing and representing themselves as discrete peoples and cultures orientalism thus conflated and reduced the non–western world into the homogeneous cultural entity known as the east therefore in service to the colonial type of imperialism the us-and-them orientalist paradigm allowed european scholars to represent the oriental world as inferior and backward irrational and wild as opposed to a western europe that was superior and progressive rational and civil—the opposite of the oriental other in edward said the exile as interpreter 1993 about saids orientalism 1978 a madhavan said that saids passionate thesis in that book now an almost canonical study represented orientalism as a style of thought based on the antinomy of east and west in their world-views and also as a corporate institution for dealing with the orientin concordance with the philosopher michel foucault said established that power and knowledge are the inseparable components of the intellectual binary relationship with which occidentals claim knowledge of the orient that the applied power of such cultural knowledge allowed europeans to rename re-define and thereby control oriental peoples places and things into imperial colonies the power–knowledge binary relation is conceptually essential to identify and understand colonialism in general and european colonialism in particular hence

to the extent that western scholars were aware of contemporary orientals or oriental movements of thought and culture these were perceived either as silent shadows to be animated by the orientalist brought into reality by them or as a kind of cultural and international proletariat useful for the orientalists grander interpretive activity

nonetheless critics of the homogeneous occident–orient binary social relation said that orientalism is of limited descriptive capability and practical application and proposed that there are variants of orientalism that apply to africa and to latin america said replied that the european west applied orientalism as a homogeneous form of the other in order to facilitate the formation of the cohesive collective european cultural identity denoted by the term the westwith this described binary logic the west generally constructs the orient subconsciously as its alter ego therefore descriptions of the orient by the occident lack material attributes grounded within land this inventive or imaginative interpretation subscribes female characteristics to the orient and plays into fantasies that are inherent within the wests alter ego it should be understood that this process draws creativity amounting an entire domain and discourse

in orientalism said mentions the production of philology the study of the history of languages lexicography dictionary making history biology political and economic theory novel-writing and lyric poetry p 6 therefore there is an entire industry that exploits the orient for its own subjective purposes that lack a native and intimate understanding such industries become institutionalized and eventually become a resource for manifest orientalism or a compilation of misinformation about the orient the ideology of empire was hardly ever a brute jingoism rather it made subtle use of reason and recruited science and history to serve its ends -imperial fictions europes myths of orient p 6
 these subjective fields of academia now synthesize the political resources and think-tanks that are so common in the west today orientalism is self-perpetuating to the extent that it becomes normalized within common discourse making people say things that are latent impulsive or not fully conscious of its own self


 gayatri spivak 
in establishing the postcolonial definition of the term subaltern the philosopher and theoretician gayatri chakravorty spivak cautioned against assigning an over-broad connotation she argues

… subaltern is not just a classy word for oppressed for the other for somebody whos not getting a piece of the pie … in postcolonial terms everything that has limited or no access to the cultural imperialism is subaltern—a space of difference now who would say thats just the oppressed the working class is oppressed its not subaltern … many people want to claim subalternity they are the least interesting and the most dangerous i mean just by being a discriminated-against minority on the university campus they dont need the word subaltern … they should see what the mechanics of the discrimination are theyre within the hegemonic discourse wanting a piece of the pie and not being allowed so let them speak use the hegemonic discourse they should not call themselves subaltern

spivak also introduced the terms essentialism and strategic essentialism to describe the social functions of postcolonialism the term essentialism denotes the perceptual dangers inherent to reviving subaltern voices in ways that might over simplify the cultural identity of heterogeneous social groups and thereby create stereotyped representations of the different identities of the people who compose a given social group the term strategic essentialism denotes a temporary essential group-identity used in the praxis of discourse among peoples furthermore essentialism can occasionally be applied—by the so-described people—to facilitate the subalterns communication in being heeded heard and understood because a strategic essentialism a fixed and established subaltern identity is more readily grasped and accepted by the popular majority in the course of inter-group discourse the important distinction between the terms is that strategic essentialism does not ignore the diversity of identities cultural and ethnic in a social group but that in its practical function strategic essentialism temporarily minimizes inter-group diversity to pragmatically support the essential group-identityspivak developed and applied foucaults term epistemic violence to describe the destruction of non–western ways of perceiving the world and the resultant dominance of the western ways of perceiving the world conceptually epistemic violence specifically relates to women whereby the subaltern woman must always be caught in translation never allowed to be truly expressing herself because the colonial powers destruction of her culture pushed to the social margins her non–western ways of perceiving understanding and knowing the worldin june of the year 1600 the afro–iberian woman francisca de figueroa requested from the king of spain his permission for her to emigrate from europe to new spain and reunite with her daughter juana de figueroa as a subaltern woman francisca repressed her native african language and spoke her request in peninsular spanish the official language of colonial latin america as a subaltern woman she applied to her voice the spanish cultural filters of sexism christian monotheism and servile language in addressing her colonial master

i francisca de figueroa mulatta in colour declare that i have in the city of cartagena a daughter named juana de figueroa and she has written to call for me in order to help me i will take with me in my company a daughter of mine her sister named maría of the said colour and for this i must write to our lord the king to petition that he favour me with a licence so that i and my said daughter can go and reside in the said city of cartagena for this i will give an account of what is put down in this report and of how i francisca de figueroa am a woman of sound body and mulatta in colour … and my daughter maría is twenty-years-old and of the said colour and of medium size once given i attest to this i beg your lordship to approve and order it done i ask for justice in this
on the twenty-first day of the month of june 1600 your majestys lords presidents and official judges of this house of contract employment order that the account she offers be received and that testimony for the purpose she requests given

moreover spivak further cautioned against ignoring subaltern peoples as cultural others and said that the west could progress—beyond the colonial perspective—by means of introspective self-criticism of the basic ideals and investigative methods that establish a culturally superior west studying the culturally inferior non–western peoples hence the integration of the subaltern voice to the intellectual spaces of social studies is problematic because of the unrealistic opposition to the idea of studying others spivak rejected such an anti-intellectual stance by social scientists and about them said that to refuse to represent a cultural other is salving your conscience … allowing you not to do any homework moreover postcolonial studies also reject the colonial cultural depiction of subaltern peoples as hollow mimics of the european colonists and their western ways and rejects the depiction of subaltern peoples as the passive recipient-vessels of the imperial and colonial power of the mother country consequent to foucault’s philosophic model of the binary relationship of power and knowledge scholars from the subaltern studies collective proposed that anti-colonial resistance always counters every exercise of colonial power


 homi k bhabha 
in the location of culture 1994 the theoretician homi k bhabha argued that viewing the human world as composed of separate and unequal cultures rather than as an integral human world perpetuates the belief in the existence of imaginary peoples and places—christendom and the islamic world the first world the second world and the third world to counter such linguistic and sociologic reductionism postcolonial praxis establishes the philosophic value of hybrid intellectual spaces wherein ambiguity abrogates truth and authenticity thereby hybridity is the philosophic condition that most substantively challenges the ideological validity of colonialism


 r siva kumar 
in 1997 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of indias independence santiniketan the making of a contextual modernism was an important exhibition curated by r siva kumar at the national gallery of modern artin his catalogue essay kumar introduced the term contextual modernism which later emerged as a postcolonial critical tool in the understanding of indian art specifically the works of nandalal bose rabindranath tagore ramkinkar baij and benode behari mukherjee
santiniketan artists did not believe that to be indigenous one has to be historicist either in theme or in style and similarly to be modern one has to adopt a particular trans-national formal language or technique modernism was to them neither a style nor a form of internationalism it was critical re-engagement with the foundational aspects of art necessitated by changes in one’s unique historical position
in the postcolonial history of art this marked the departure from eurocentric unilateral idea of modernism to alternative context sensitive modernisms

the brief survey of the individual works of the core santiniketan artists and the thought perspectives they open up makes clear that though there were various contact points in the work they were not bound by a continuity of style but buy a community of ideas which they not only shared but also interpreted and carried forward thus they do not represent a school but a movement

several terms including paul gilroy’s counter culture of modernity and tani e barlows colonial modernity have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-european contexts professor gall argues that ‘contextual modernism’ is a more suited term because “the colonial in colonial modernity does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonized situations to internalize inferiority santiniketan’s artist teachers’ refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterized imperial western modernity and modernism those european modernities projected through a triumphant british colonial power provoked nationalist responses equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms”


 dipesh chakrabarty 
in provincializing europe 2000 dipesh chakrabarty charted the subaltern history of the indian struggle for independence and countered eurocentric western scholarship about non-western peoples and cultures by proposing that western europe simply be considered as culturally equal to the other cultures of the world that is as one region among many in human geography 


 derek gregory 
derek gregory argues the long trajectory through history of british and american colonization is an ongoing process still happening today in the colonial present gregory traces connections between the geopolitics of events happening in modern-day afghanistan palestine and iraq and links it back to the us-and-them binary relation between the western and eastern world building upon the ideas of the other and saids work on orientalism gregory critiques the economic policy military apparatus and transnational corporations as vehicles driving present day colonialism emphasizing ideas of discussing ideas around colonialism in the present tense gregory utilizes modern events such as the september 11 attacks to tell spatial stories around the colonial behavior happening due to the war on terror


 amar acheraiou 
acheraiou argues that colonialism was a capitalist venture moved by appropriation and plundering of foreign lands and was supported by military force and a discourse that legitimized violence in the name of progress and a universal civilizing mission this discourse is complex and multi-faceted it was elaborated in the 19th century by colonial ideologues such as joseph-ernest renan and arthur de gobineau but its roots reach far back in history in rethinking postcolonialism colonialist discourse in modern literature and the legacy of classical writers amar acheraiou discusses the history of colonialist discourse and traces its spirit to ancient greece including europe’s claim to racial supremacy and right to rule over non-europeans harboured by renan and other 19th century colonial ideologues he argues that modern colonial representations of the colonized as “inferior” “stagnant” and “degenerate” were borrowed from greek and latin authors like lysias 440-380 bc isocrates 436-338 bc plato 427-327 bc aristotle 384—322 bc cicero 106-43 bc and sallust 86-34 bc who all considered their racial others – the persians scythians egyptians as “backward” “inferior” and “effeminate” among these ancient writers aristotle is the one who articulated more thoroughly these ancient racial assumptions which served as a source of inspiration for modern colonists in the politics he established a racial classification and ranked the greeks superior to the rest he considered them as an ideal race to rule over asian and other ‘barbarian’ peoples for they knew how to blend the spirit of the european “war-like races” with asiatic “intelligence” and “competence”ancient rome was a source of admiration in europe since the enlightenment in france voltaire 1694-1778 was one of the most fervent admirers of rome he regarded highly the roman republican values of rationality democracy order and justice in early-eighteenth century britain it was poets and politicians like joseph addison 1672-1719 and richard glover 1712 –1785 who were vocal advocates of these ancient republican values
it was in the mid-eighteenth century that ancient greece became a source of admiration among the french and british this enthusiasm gained prominence in the late-eighteenth century it was spurred by german hellenist scholars and english romantic poets johann joachim winckelmann 1717-1768 wilhelm von humboldt 1767-1835 and goethe 1749-1832 lord byron 1788-1824 samuel taylor coleridge 1772-1834 percy bysshe shelley 1792-1822 and john keats 1795-1821 these scholars and poets regarded ancient greece as the matrix of western civilization and a model of beauty and democracyin the nineteenth century when europe began to expand across the globe and establish colonies ancient greece and rome were used as a source of empowerment and justification to western civilizing mission at this period many french and british imperial ideologues identified strongly with the ancient empires and invoked ancient greece and rome to justify the colonial civilizing project they urged european colonizers to emulate these “ideal” classical conquerors whom they regarded as “universal instructors” for alexis de tocqueville 1805-1859 an ardent and influential advocate of la “grande france” the classical empires were model conquerors to imitate he advised the french colonists in algeria to follow the ancient imperial example in 1841 he stated ‘what matters most when we want to set up and develop a colony is to make sure that those who arrive in it are as less estranged as possible that these newcomers meet a perfect image of their homeland…the thousand colonies that the greeks founded on the mediterranean coasts were all exact copies of the greek cities on which they had been modelled the romans established in almost all parts of the globe known to them municipalities which were no more than miniature romes among modern colonizers the english did the same who can prevent us from emulating these european peoples’ the greeks and romans were deemed exemplary conquerors and “heuristic teachers” whose lessons were invaluable for modern colonists ideologues john-robert seeley 1834-1895 a history professor at cambridge and proponent of imperialism stated in a rhetoric which echoed that of renan that the role of the british empire was ‘similar to that of rome in which we hold the position of not merely of ruling but of an educating and civilizing race”the incorporation of ancient concepts and racial and cultural assumptions into modern imperial ideology bolstered colonial claims to supremacy and right to colonize non-europeans because of these numerous ramifications between ancient representations and modern colonial rhetoric 19th century’s colonialist discourse acquires a “multi-layered” or “palimpsestic” structure it forms a “historical ideological and narcissistic continuum” in which modern theories of domination feed upon and blend with “ancient myths of supremacy and grandeur”


 postcolonial literary study 
as a literary theory postcolonialism deals with the literatures produced by the peoples who once were colonies of the european imperial powers eg britain france and spain and the literatures of the decolonized countries engaged in contemporary postcolonial arrangements eg organisation internationale de la francophonie and the commonwealth of nations with their former mother countries postcolonial literary criticism comprehends the literatures written by the colonizer and the colonized wherein the subject matter includes portraits of the colonized peoples and their lives as imperial subjects in dutch literature the indies literature includes the colonial and postcolonial genres which examine and analyze the formation of a postcolonial identity and the postcolonial culture produced by the diaspora of the indo-european peoples the eurasian folk who originated from indonesia the peoples who were the colony of the dutch east indies in the literature the notable author is tjalie robinsonto perpetuate and facilitate control of the colonial enterprise some colonized people especially from among the subaltern peoples of the british empire were sent to attend university in the imperial motherland they were to become the native-born but europeanised ruling class of colonial satraps yet after decolonization their bicultural educations originated postcolonial criticism of empire and colonialism and of the representations of the colonist and the colonized in the late twentieth century after the dissolution of the ussr 1991 the constituent soviet socialist republics became the literary subjects of postcolonial criticism wherein the writers dealt with the legacies cultural social economic of the russification of their peoples countries and cultures in service to greater russiapostcolonial literary study is in two categories i that of the postcolonial nations and ii that of the nations who continue forging a postcolonial national identity the first category of literature presents and analyzes the internal challenges inherent to determining an ethnic identity in a decolonized nation the second category of literature presents and analyzes the degeneration of civic and nationalist unities consequent to ethnic parochialism usually manifested as the demagoguery of protecting the nation a variant of the us-and-them binary social relation civic and national unity degenerate when a patriarchal régime unilaterally defines what is and what is not the national culture of the decolonized country the nation-state collapses either into communal movements espousing grand political goals for the postcolonial nation or into ethnically mixed communal movements espousing political separatism as occurred in decolonized rwanda the sudan and the democratic republic of the congo thus the postcolonial extremes against which frantz fanon warned in 1961
regarding sociolinguistic interpretations of literary texts through postcolonial lenses we may refer to jaydeep sarangis book indian novels in english a sociolinguistic study2005


 application of postcolonial theory 


 the middle east 
in the essays overstating the arab state 2001 by nazih ayubi and is jordan palestine 2003 by raphael israel the authors deal with the psychologically fragmented postcolonial identity as determined by the effects political and social cultural and economic of western colonialism in the middle east as such the fragmented national identity remains a characteristic of such societies consequence of the imperially convenient but arbitrary colonial boundaries geographic and cultural demarcated by the europeans with which they ignored the tribal and clan relations that determined the geographic borders of the middle east countries before the arrival of european imperialists hence the postcolonial literature about the middle east examines and analizes the western discourses about identity formation the existence and inconsistent nature of a postcolonial national-identity among the peoples of the contemporary middle east

in the essay “who am i the identity crisis in the middle east” 2006 pr kumaraswamy said

most countries of the middle east suffered from the fundamental problems over their national identities more than three-quarters of a century after the disintegration of the ottoman empire from which most of them emerged these states have been unable to define project and maintain a national identity that is both inclusive and representative
independence and the end of colonialism did not end social fragmentation and war civil and international in the middle east  in the search for arab democracy discourses and counter-discourses 2004 larbi sadiki said that the problems of national identity in the middle east are a consequence of the orientalist indifference of the european empires when they demarcated the political borders of their colonies which ignored the local history and the geographic and tribal boundaries observed by the natives in the course of establishing the western version of the middle east
in the event in places like iraq and jordan leaders of the new sovereign states were brought in from the outside and tailored to suit colonial interests and commitments likewise most states in the persian gulf were handed over to those europeanised colonial subjects who could protect and safeguard imperial interests in the post-withdrawal phase  moreover with notable exceptions like egypt iran iraq and syria most countries    have had to reinvent their historical roots after decolonization and like its colonial predecessor postcolonial identity owes its existence to force


 africa 

in the late 19th century the scramble for africa 1874–1914 proved to be the tail end of mercantilist colonialism of the european imperial powers yet for the africans the consequences were greater than elsewhere in the colonized non–western world to facilitate the colonization the european empires laid railroads where the rivers and the land proved impassable the imperial british railroad effort proved overambitious in the effort of traversing continental africa yet succeeded only in connecting colonial north africa cairo with the colonial south of africa cape town
upon arriving to africa the europeans encountered the native african civilizations of the ashanti empire the benin empire the kingdom of dahomey the buganda kingdom uganda and the kingdom of kongo all of which were annexed by imperial powers under the belief that they required european stewardship as proposed and justified in the essay the african character 1830 by g w f hegel in keeping with his philosophic opinion that cultures were stages in the course of the historical unfolding of the absolute nigeria was the homeland of the hausa people the yoruba people and the igbo people which last were among the first people to develop their history in constructing a postcolonial identity see things fall apart 1958
about east africa the kenyan writer ngũgĩ wa thiongo wrote weep not child 1964 the first postcolonial novel about the east african experience of colonial imperialism in the river between 1965 with the mau mau uprising 1952–60 as political background he addressed the postcolonial matters of native religious culture and the consequences of the imposition of christianity a religion culturally foreign to kenya and to most of africa and the essay decolonizing the mind the politics of language in african literature 1986
in postcolonial countries of africa the africans and the non–africans live in a world of genders ethnicities classes and languages of ages families professions religions and nations there is a suggestion that individualism and postcolonialism are essentially discontinuous and divergent cultural phenomena


 asia 

french indochina was divided into five subdivisions tonkin annam cochinchina cambodia and laos cochinchina southern vietnam was the first territory under french control saigon was conquered in 1859 then in 1887 the indochinese union union indochinoise was established
in 1924 nguyen ai quoc ho chi minh wrote the first critical text against the french colonization le procès de la colonization française french colonization on trial
trinh t minh-ha has been developing her innovative theories about postcolonialism in various means of expression literature films and teaching she is best known for her film reassemblage made in 1982 in which she tried to deconstruct anthropology as a western male hegemonic ideology in 1989 she wrote woman native other writing postcoloniality and feminism where she focuses on the acknowledgement of oral tradition


 structural adjustment programmes saps 
structural adjustment programmes saps implemented by the world bank and imf are viewed by some postcolonialists as the modern procedure of colonization structural adjustment programmes saps calls for trade liberalization privatization of banks health care and educational institutions these implementations minimized governments role paved pathways for companies to enter africa for its resources limited to production and exportation of cash crops many african nations acquired more debt and were left stranded in a position where acquiring more loan and continuing to pay high interest became an endless cycleosterhammels the dictionary of human geography uses the definition of colonialism as enduring relationship of domination and mode of dispossession usually or at least initially between an indigenous or enslaved majority and a minority of interlopers colonizers who are convinced of their own superiority pursue their own interests and exercise power through a mixture of coercion persuasion conflict and collaboration  the definition adopted by the dictionary of human geography suggests that the structural adjustment programmes implemented by the washington consensus is indeed an act of colonization


 criticism of postcolonial theory 


 undermining of universal values 
indian marxist scholar vivek chibber has critiqued some foundational logics of postcolonial theory in his book postcolonial theory and the specter of capital developing on aijaz ahmads earlier critique of saids orientalism and sumit sarkars critique of the subaltern studies scholars chibber focuses on and refutes the principal historical claims made by the subaltern studies scholars claims which are representative of the whole of postcolonial theory postcolonial theory he argues essentializes cultures painting them as fixed and static categories moreover it presents the difference between east and west as unbridgeable hence denying peoples universal aspirations and universal interests he also criticized the postcolonial tendency to characterize all of enlightenment values as eurocentric according to him the theory will be remembered for its revival of cultural essentialism and its acting as an endorsement of orientalism rather than being an antidote to it


 fixation on national identity 
the concentration of postcolonial studies upon the subject of national identity has determined it is essential to the creation and establishment of a stable nation and country in the aftermath of decolonization yet indicates that either an indeterminate or an ambiguous national identity has tended to limit the social cultural and economic progress of a decolonized people in overstating the arab state 2001 by nazih ayubi the moroccan scholar bin abd al-ali proposed that the existence of a pathological obsession with    identity is a cultural theme common to the contemporary academic field middle eastern studiesnevertheless kumaraswamy and sadiki said that such a common sociological problem—that of an indeterminate national identity—among the countries of the middle east is an important aspect that must be accounted in order to have an understanding of the politics of the contemporary middle east in the event ayubi asks if what bin abd al–ali sociologically described as an obsession with national identity might be explained by the absence of a championing social class
