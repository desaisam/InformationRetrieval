comet finlay is a periodic comet in the solar system discovered by william henry finlay royal observatory cape of good hope south africa on september 26 1886 it came to perihelion closest approach to the sun on december 27 2014 at around apparent magnitude 10


 description 
when the first parabolic orbit calculations were made in 1886 there was a similarity between this orbit and that of francesco de vicos lost periodic comet of 1844 54pde vico-swift-neat lewis boss dudley observatory schenectady united states noted large discrepancies between the orbits and after further observations concluded that de vicos comet could not be the same as finlaysthe 1899 apparition was missed in 1910 a close pass with jupiter increased the orbital period in 1919 the path was off predictions and a new comet discovered by sasaki kyoto observatory japan on october 25 1919 was discovered to be finlays
the magnitude of the comet declined after 1926 and it was not until 1953 that it has been observed on every return
during the 2015 perihelion passage the comet outburst on 16 december 2014 from magnitude 11 to magnitude 9 becoming bright enough to be seen in common binoculars with a 50 mm objective lens on december 23 2014 15p and mars were only 1/6 of a degree apart in the sky after sunset but by december 23 2014 the comet had dimmed considerably since the outburst on 16 january 2015 the comet outburst to magnitude 8the comet currently has an earth-moid of 0.01 au 1,500,000 km 930,000 mi on october 25 2060 the comet will pass roughly 0.04 au 6,000,000 km 3,700,000 mi from the earth
