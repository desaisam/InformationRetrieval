32pcomas solà is a periodic comet with a current orbital period of 8.8 years
the comet nucleus is estimated to be 8.4 kilometers in diameter


 history 
32pcomas solà was discovered november 5 1926 by josep comas solà as part of his work on asteroids for the fabra observatory barcelona he was taking photographs with a 6-inch 150 mm telescope the comets past orbital evolution became a point of interest as several astronomers suggested early on that the comet might be a return of the then lost periodic comet spitaler aka 113pspitaler in 1935 additional positions had been obtained and p ramensky investigated the orbital motion back to 1911 he noted the comet passed very close to jupiter during may 1912 and that prior to this approach the comet had a perihelion distance of 2.15 au and an orbital period of 9.43 years the identity with comet spitaler was thus disproven
in 1933 the danish astronomer julie vinter hansen undertook significant new research which calculated the orbit of the comet up to 1980 predicting when it would return to the earths orbit


 trivia 
the title of the early tangerine dream piece fly and collision of comas sola appearing on the alpha centauri 1971 album refers to this comet which at the time was undergoing a moderately close 0.73 au approach to jupiter
