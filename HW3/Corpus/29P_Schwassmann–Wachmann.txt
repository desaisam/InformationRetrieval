comet 29pschwassmann–wachmann also known as schwassmann–wachmann 1 was discovered on november 15 1927 by arnold schwassmann and arno arthur wachmann at the hamburg observatory in bergedorf germany it was discovered photographically when the comet was in outburst and the magnitude was about 13 precovery images of the comet from march 4 1902 were found in 1931 and showed the comet at 12th magnitudethe comet is unusual in that while normally hovering at around 16th magnitude it suddenly undergoes an outburst this causes the comet to brighten by 1 to 4 magnitudes this happens with a frequency of 7.3 outbursts per year fading within a week or two the magnitude of the comet has been known to vary from 19th magnitude to 9th magnitude a ten thousand-fold increase in brightness during its brightest outbursts highly changing surface processes are suspected to be responsible for the observed behaviorthe comet is thought to be a member of a relatively new class of objects called centaurs of which at least 400 are known these are small icy bodies with orbits between those of jupiter and neptune astronomers believe that centaurs are recent escapees from the kuiper belt a zone of small bodies orbiting in a cloud at the distant reaches of the solar system frequent perturbations by jupiter will likely accumulate and cause the comet to migrate either inward or outward by the year 4000the dust and gas comprising the comets nucleus is part of the same primordial materials from which the sun and planets were formed billions of years ago the complex carbon-rich molecules they contain may have provided some of the raw materials from which life originated on earth
the comet nucleus is estimated to be 30.8 kilometers in diameter29p comes to perihelion on march 7 2019 and opposition on october 9 2019
