a hypothetical solar system object is a planet natural satellite moonmoon or similar body in the solar system whose existence is not known but has been inferred from observational scientific evidence over the years a number of hypothetical planets have been proposed and many have been disproved however even today there is scientific speculation about the possibility of planets yet unknown that may exist beyond the range of our current knowledge


 planets 
counter-earth a planet situated on the other side of the sun from that of the earth
fifth planet hypothetical historical speculation about a planet between the orbits of mars and jupiter
phaeton a planet situated between the orbits of mars and jupiter whose destruction supposedly led to the formation of the asteroid belt these days this hypothesis is considered unlikely since the asteroid belt has far too little mass to have resulted from the explosion of a large planet
planet v a planet thought by john chambers and jack lissauer to have once existed between mars and the asteroid belt based on computer simulations
planet nine a planet proposed to explain apparent alignments in the orbits of a number of distant trans-neptunian objects
planet x a hypothetical planet beyond neptune initially employed to account for supposed perturbations systematic deviations in the orbits of uranus and neptune belief in its existence ultimately inspired the search for pluto though the concept has since been abandoned following more precise measurements of neptunes mass which accounted for all observed perturbations it has been re-applied to account for supposed deviations in the motions  of kuiper belt objects such explanations are still controversial however
theia a mars-sized impactor believed to have collided with the earth roughly 4.5 billion years ago an event which created the moon
vulcan a hypothetical planet once believed to exist inside the orbit of mercury initially proposed as the cause for the perturbations in the orbit of mercury some astronomers spent many years searching for it with many instances of people claiming to have found it the perturbations in mercurys orbit were later accounted for via einsteins general theory of relativity
vulcanoids asteroids that may exist within a gravitationally stable region inside mercurys orbit
tyche a hypothetical planet in the oort cloud supposedly responsible for producing the statistical excess in long period comets in a band results from the wise telescope survey in 2014 have ruled it out
in the five-planet nice model a fifth giant planet originally in an orbit between saturn and uranus is ejected from the solar system into interstellar space after a close encounter with jupiter resulting in a rapid divergence of jupiters and saturns orbit may have ensured the orbital stability of the terrestrial planets in the inner solar system it may have also precipitated the late heavy bombardment of the inner solar system


 moons 
chiron a moon of saturn supposedly sighted by hermann goldschmidt in 1861 but never observed by anyone else
other moons of earth such as petits moon lilith waltemaths moons and bargbys moons
mercurys moon hypothesised to account for an unusual pattern of radiation detected by mariner 10 in the vicinity of mercury subsequent data from the mission revealed the actual source to be the star 31 crateris
neith a purported moon of venus falsely detected by a number of telescopic observers in the 17th and 18th centuries now known not to exist the object has been explained as a series of misidentified stars and internal reflections inside the optics of particular telescope designs
themis a moon of saturn which astronomer william pickering claimed to have discovered in 1905 but which was never seen again


 star 
nemesis a brown or red dwarf whose existence was suggested in 1984 by physicist richard a muller based on purported periodicities in mass extinctions within earths fossil record its regular passage through the solar systems oort cloud would send large numbers of comets towards earth massively increasing the chances of an impact also believed to be the cause of minor planet sednas unusual elongated orbit the existence of the nemesis in the modern solar system was ruled out in 2014 after the infrared survey performed by wise spacecraft found no brown dwarf up to 10,000 astronomical units 0.16 ly from sun
