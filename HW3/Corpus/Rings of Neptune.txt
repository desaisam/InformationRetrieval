the rings of neptune consist primarily of five principal rings and were first discovered as arcs on 22 july 1984 in chile by patrice bouchet reinhold häfner and jean manfroid at la silla observatory eso during an observing program proposed by andré brahic and bruno sicardy from paris observatory and at cerro tololo interamerican observatory by f vilas and l-r elicer for a program led by william hubbard they were eventually imaged in 1989 by the voyager 2 spacecraft at their densest they are comparable to the less dense portions of saturns main rings such as the c ring and the cassini division but much of neptunes ring system is quite tenuous faint and dusty more closely resembling the rings of jupiter neptunes rings are named after astronomers who contributed important work on the planet galle le verrier lassell arago and adams neptune also has a faint unnamed ring coincident with the orbit of the moon galatea three other moons orbit between the rings naiad thalassa and despinathe rings of neptune are made of extremely dark material likely organic compounds processed by radiation similar to that found in the rings of uranus the proportion of dust in the rings between 20% and 70 is high while their optical depth is low to moderate at less than 0.1 uniquely the adams ring includes five distinct arcs named fraternité égalité 1 and 2 liberté and courage the arcs occupy a narrow range of orbital longitudes and are remarkably stable having changed only slightly since their initial detection in 1980 how the arcs are stabilized is still under debate however their stability is probably related to the resonant interaction between the adams ring and its inner shepherd moon galatea


 discovery and observations 

the first mention of rings around neptune dates back to 1846 when william lassell the discoverer of neptunes largest moon triton thought he had seen a ring around the planet however his claim was never confirmed and it is likely that it was an observational artifact the first reliable detection of a ring was made in 1968 by stellar occultation although that result would go unnoticed until 1977 when the rings of uranus were discovered soon after the uranus discovery a team from villanova university led by harold j reitsema began searching for rings around neptune on 24 may 1981 they detected a dip in a stars brightness during one occultation however the manner in which the star dimmed did not suggest a ring later after the voyager fly-by it was found that the occultation was due to the small neptunian moon larissa a highly unusual eventin the 1980s significant occultations were much rarer for neptune than for uranus which lay near the milky way at the time and was thus moving against a denser field of stars neptunes next occultation on 12 september 1983 resulted in a possible detection of a ring however ground-based results were inconclusive over the next six years approximately 50 other occultations were observed with only about one-third of them yielding positive results something probably incomplete arcs definitely existed around neptune but the features of the ring system remained a mystery the voyager 2 spacecraft made the definitive discovery of the neptunian rings during its fly-by of neptune in 1989 passing by as close as 4,950 km 3,080 mi above the planets atmosphere on 25 august it confirmed that occasional occultation events observed before were indeed caused by the arcs within the adams ring see below after the voyager fly-by the previous terrestrial occultation observations were reanalyzed yielding features of the rings arcs as they were in 1980s which matched those found by voyager 2 almost perfectlysince voyager 2s fly-by the brightest rings adams and le verrier have been imaged with the hubble space telescope and earth-based telescopes owing to advances in resolution and light-gathering power they are visible slightly above background noise levels at methane-absorbed wavelengths in which the glare from neptune is significantly reduced the fainter rings are still far below the visibility threshold


 general properties 

neptune possesses five distinct rings named in order of increasing distance from the planet galle le verrier lassell arago and adams in addition to these well-defined rings neptune may also possess an extremely faint sheet of material stretching inward from the le verrier to the galle ring and possibly farther in toward the planet three of the neptunian rings are narrow with widths of about 100 km or less in contrast the galle and lassell rings are broad—their widths are between 2,000 and 5,000 km the adams ring consists of five bright arcs embedded in a fainter continuous ring proceeding counterclockwise the arcs are fraternité égalité 1 and 2 liberté and courage the first three names come from liberty equality fraternity the motto of the french revolution and republic the terminology was suggested by their original discoverers who had found them during stellar occultations in 1984 and 1985 four small neptunian moons have orbits inside the ring system naiad and thalassa orbit in the gap between the galle and le verrier rings despina is just inward of the le verrier ring and galatea lies slightly inward of the adams ring embedded in an unnamed faint narrow ringletthe neptunian rings contain a large quantity of micrometer-sized dust the dust fraction by cross-section area is between 20% and 70 in this respect they are similar to the rings of jupiter in which the dust fraction is 50–100 and are very different from the rings of saturn and uranus which contain little dust less than 0.1 the particles in neptunes rings are made from a dark material probably a mixture of ice with radiation-processed organics the rings are reddish in color and their geometrical 0.05 and bond 0.01–0.02 albedos are similar to those of the uranian rings particles and the inner neptunian moons the rings are generally optically thin transparent their normal optical depths do not exceed 0.1 as a whole the neptunian rings resemble those of jupiter both systems consist of faint narrow dusty ringlets and even fainter broad dusty ringsthe rings of neptune like those of uranus are thought to be relatively young their age is probably significantly less than that of the solar system also like those of uranus neptunes rings probably resulted from the collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons such events create moonlet belts which act as the sources of dust for the rings in this respect the rings of neptune are similar to faint dusty bands observed by voyager 2 between the main rings of uranus


 inner rings 
the innermost ring of neptune is called the galle ring after johann gottfried galle the first person to see neptune through a telescope 1846 it is about 2,000 km wide and orbits 41,000–43,000 km from the planet it is a faint ring with an average normal optical depth of around 10−4 and with an equivalent depth of 0.15 km the fraction of dust in this ring is estimated from 40% to 70the next ring is named the le verrier ring after urbain le verrier who predicted neptunes position in 1846 with an orbital radius of about 53,200 km it is narrow with a width of about 113 km its normal optical depth is 0.0062 ± 0.0015 which corresponds to an equivalent depth of 0.7 ± 0.2 km the dust fraction in the le verrier ring ranges from 40% to 70 the small moon despina which orbits just inside of it at 52,526 km may play a role in the rings confinement by acting as a shepherdthe lassell ring also known as the plateau is the broadest ring in the neptunian system it is the namesake of william lassell the english astronomer who discovered neptunes largest moon triton this ring is a faint sheet of material occupying the space between the le verrier ring at about 53,200 km and the arago ring at 57,200 km its average normal optical depth is around 10−4 which corresponds to an equivalent depth of 0.4 km the rings dust fraction is in the range from 20% to 40there is a small peak of brightness near the outer edge of the lassell ring located at 57,200 km from neptune and less than 100 km wide which some planetary scientists call the arago ring after françois arago a french mathematician physicist astronomer and politician however many publications do not mention the arago ring at all


 adams ring 

the outer adams ring with an orbital radius of about 63,930 km is the best studied of neptunes rings it is named after john couch adams who predicted the position of neptune independently of le verrier this ring is narrow slightly eccentric and inclined with total width of about 35 km 15–50 km and its normal optical depth is around 0.011 ± 0.003 outside the arcs which corresponds to the equivalent depth of about 0.4 km the fraction of dust in this ring is from 20% to 40—lower than in other narrow rings neptunes small moon galatea which orbits just inside of the adams ring at 61,953 km acts like a shepherd keeping ring particles inside a narrow range of orbital radii through a 4243 outer lindblad resonance galateas gravitational influence creates 42 radial wiggles in the adams ring with an amplitude of about 30 km which have been used to infer galateas mass


 arcs 
the brightest parts of the adams ring the ring arcs were the first elements of neptunes ring system to be discovered the arcs are discrete regions within the ring in which the particles that it comprises are mysteriously clustered together the adams ring is known to comprise five short arcs which occupy a relatively narrow range of longitudes from 247° to 294° in 1986 they were located between longitudes of

247–257° fraternité
261–264° égalité 1
265–266° égalité 2
276–280° liberté
284.5–285.5° couragethe brightest and longest arc was fraternité the faintest was courage the normal optical depths of the arcs are estimated to lie in the range 0.03–0.09 0.034 ± 0.005 for the leading edge of liberté arc as measured by stellar occultation the radial widths are approximately the same as those of the continuous ring—about 30 km the equivalent depths of arcs vary in the range 1.25–2.15 km 0.77 ± 0.13 km for the leading edge of liberté arc the fraction of dust in the arcs is from 40% to 70 the arcs in the adams ring are somewhat similar to the arc in saturns g ringthe highest resolution voyager 2 images revealed a pronounced clumpiness in the arcs with a typical separation between visible clumps of 0.1° to 0.2° which corresponds to 100–200 km along the ring because the clumps were not resolved they may or may not include larger bodies but are certainly associated with concentrations of microscopic dust as evidenced by their enhanced brightness when backlit by the sunthe arcs are quite stable structures they were detected by ground-based stellar occultations in the 1980s by voyager 2 in 1989 and by hubble space telescope and ground-based telescopes in 1997–2005 and remained at approximately the same orbital longitudes however some changes have been noticed the overall brightness of arcs decreased since 1986 the courage arc jumped forward by 8° to 294° it probably jumped over to the next stable co-rotation resonance position while the liberté arc had almost disappeared by 2003 the fraternité and égalité 1 and 2 arcs have demonstrated irregular variations in their relative brightness their observed dynamics is probably related to the exchange of dust between them courage a very faint arc found during the voyager flyby was seen to flare in brightness in 1998 it was back to its usual dimness by june 2005 visible light observations show that the total amount of material in the arcs has remained approximately constant but they are dimmer in the infrared light wavelengths where previous observations were taken


 confinement 
the arcs in the adams ring remain unexplained their existence is a puzzle because basic orbital dynamics imply that they should spread out into a uniform ring over a matter of years several theories about the arcs confinement have been suggested the most widely publicized of which holds that galatea confines the arcs via its 4243 co-rotational inclination resonance cir the resonance creates 84 stable sites along the rings orbit each 4° long with arcs residing in the adjacent sites however measurements of the rings mean motion with hubble and keck telescopes in 1998 led to the conclusion that the rings are not in cir with galateaa later model suggested that confinement resulted from a co-rotational eccentricity resonance cer the model takes into account the finite mass of the adams ring which is necessary to move the resonance closer to the ring a byproduct of this theory is a mass estimate for the adams ring—about 0.002 of the mass of galatea a third theory proposed in 1986 requires an additional moon orbiting inside the ring the arcs in this case are trapped in its stable lagrangian points however voyager 2s observations placed strict constraints on the size and mass of any undiscovered moons making such a theory unlikely some other more complicated theories hold that a number of moonlets are trapped in co-rotational resonances with galatea providing confinement of the arcs and simultaneously serving as sources of the dust


 exploration 
the rings were investigated in detail during the voyager 2 spacecrafts flyby of neptune in august 1989 they were studied with optical imaging and through observations of occultations in ultraviolet and visible light the spaceprobe observed the rings in different geometries relative to the sun producing images of back-scattered forward-scattered and side-scattered light analysis of these images allowed derivation of the phase function dependence of the rings reflectivity on the angle between the observer and sun and geometrical and bond albedo of ring particles analysis of voyagers images also led to discovery of six inner moons of neptune including the adams ring shepherd galatea
