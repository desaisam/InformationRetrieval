this is a list of gravitationally rounded objects of the solar system which are objects that have a rounded ellipsoidal shape due to the forces of their own gravity hydrostatic equilibrium their sizes range from dwarf planets and moons to the planets and the sun this list does not include any small solar system bodies but it does include a sample of planetary-mass objects whose shape has yet to be accurately determined the suns orbital characteristics are listed in relation to the galactic center while all other objects are listed in order of their distance from the sun


 sun 

the sun is a g-type main-sequence star it contains almost 99.9 percent of all the mass in the solar system


 planets 

a planet is defined according to the 2006 international astronomical union iau definition as a body in orbit around the sun that was large enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and to have cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit  the practical meaning of cleared the neighborhood is that a planet is comparatively massive enough for its gravitation to control the orbits of all objects in its vicinity by the iaus definition there are eight planets in the solar system four terrestrial planets mercury venus earth and mars and four giant planets which can be divided further into two gas giants jupiter and saturn and two ice giants uranus and neptune when excluding the sun the four giant planets account for more than 99 percent of the mass of the solar system


 dwarf planets 

the iau the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies defines dwarf planets as bodies that are large enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium but have not cleared their neighbourhoods of similar objects since 2008 there have been five dwarf planets recognized by the iau ceres orbits in the asteroid belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter the others orbit beyond neptune and are subclassified as plutoids


 most-likely additional dwarf planets 

these trans-neptunian objects are theoretically large enough to be dwarf planets dozens more could have been included both quaoar and orcus have known moons that have allowed the mass of the systems to be determined both are more massive than the 5Ã—1020 kg recommendation of the iau 2006 draft proposal as sufficient for classification as a dwarf planet
however it is possible that dark low-density objects like salacia retain internal porosity from their formation and are not planetary bodies in this case only 2007 or10 quaoar orcus and sedna are likely dwarf-planet candidates


 satellites 

there are 19 natural satellites in the solar system that are known to be massive enough to be close to hydrostatic equilibrium alan stern calls these satellite planets although the term major moon is more common
several of these were once in equilibrium but are no longer these include all of the moons listed for saturn apart from titan and rhea other moons that were once in equilibrium but are no longer very round such as saturns phoebe are not included satellites are listed first in order from the sun and second in order from their parent body
