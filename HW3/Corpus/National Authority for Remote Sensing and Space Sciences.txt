national authority for remote sensing and space sciences narss is the pioneering egyptian institution in the field of satellite remote sensing


 history 
narss is an outgrowth of remote sensing center established in 1971 as an american-egyptian joint project they were affiliated with the egyptian academy of scientific research and technology in 1994 the authority was established as an organization under the state ministry of scientific research to promote the use of state of the art space technology for the development of the country and introducing high tech capabilities to regional planning and other applicationsnarss includes two major sectors remote sensing and space sciences the sector of remote sensing works on the use of data provided by earth observation satellites and various airborne sensors to produce maps and spatial data for the evaluation and monitoring of natural resources natural hazards and management environmental the sector of space sciences is concerned with the development of sensors for earth observation to be mounted on satellites and with all the problems involved with monitoring communication with satellites and retrieving the information for processing and ultimately on launching an egyptian remote sensing satellite


 facilities
