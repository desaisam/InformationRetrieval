the romanian space agency rosa is a public institution with extrabudgetary funding which coordinates the national space technology research programs and the space research related activities since 1991 rosa is subordinated to the ministry of educationas representative of the romanian government the romanian space agency establishes cooperative agreements with international organizations such as the european space agency and the committee on space research cospar and also bilateral agreements together with the ministry of foreign affairs rosa represents romania at the united nations committee on the peaceful use of outer space - copuos and at its subcommittees
the romanian space agency also conducts research projects through the rosa research center


 history 
romania has a long tradition in the aeronautical industry which includes several historical personalities such as

conrad haas who constructed multistage rockets with delta stabilizers in 1529 sibiu
traian vuia designer and constructor of the first autonomous take-off aeroplane in 1906
henri coandă designer and constructor of the first jet aeroplane in 1910
hermann oberth designer of space rockets and father of space navigation
elie carafoli contributor in aerodynamics and space sciences former president of the iafromania can look upon a heritage of companies like aerostar avioane craiova industria aeronautică română romaero and societatea pentru exploatări tehnice – today more than twenty types of aircraft are being manufactured in romania some based on domestic designs
owing to this heritage the country has some experience in the field of space applications such as satellite communications remote sensing geographic information systems andglobal information positioning and navigation systems since 1977 it operates an intelsat ground station in cheia with two 32 m antennas romania contributed to more than thirty scientific and technological space missions in the interkosmos program including the 1981 flight of dorin-dumitru prunariu on the soyuz 40
the government together with private entities in romania supports space activities as important and necessary element for the social development therefore in 1992 romania was one of the first eastern european country to sign a cooperation agreement with esa for the peaceful uses of outer space followed by a framework agreement with esa in 2006 romania contributed through co-investigators to several esa missions such as hershel planck soho and gaia
since 2012 the romanian flag is raised at the european space agency esa headquarters after romania officially became the 19th esa member state on 22 december 2012
with romanias accession to esa it was opened for the romanian researchers especially for the romanian industry the opportunity to participate in esa missions over two decades the romanian space agency rosa based on their own research and consulting efforts has become a scientific and high technology organization that coordinates promotes and represents the national research activities and space aerospace and security applications


 objectives 
rosas main objective is to create favorable conditions for conducting space research and development activities and to initiate and coordinate basic and applied research in space rosa ensures romanias active presence in international actions that lead to advances in space and use of outer space for peaceful purposes also rosa represents warrant based the government in relations arising from agreements concluded by romania with foreign partners regarding space problems


 management 
president of the romanian space agency rosa since 2004 and also executive director of the same organization starting 2005 marius-ioan piso born on january 7 1954 phd in physics and senior scientist 1st degree coordinates the agencys development following three strategic directions the romanian space strategy implementation’s planning and coordination representing romania nationally and internationally and the constant development of partnerships collaborations and bi- and multi-lateral relationships and last but not least the agency’s involvement in national and international research and development programmes in space aeronautics and security domains
his name is linked to the establishment of the romanian space agency in 1991 and the achievement of the organizations independency four years later to the foundation of the institute of space science but also to the romania and european space agency esa cooperations start the constant concern regarding space research and technology development in romania and the results obtained over time by the scientific and technological community often under his supervision or guidance have resulted in the countrys accession to the european space agency in january 2011

 joining esa 
the first agreement between romania and the european space agency esa was signed in 1992 followed in 1999 by the romania-esa agreement on cooperation in the peaceful exploration and use of space since 2007 romania contributes to the esa budget as a european cooperating state pecs status ratified by law no 1/2007
on december 22 2011 romania became the 19th member of the european space agency
an important step in the accession process was to conduct a technical audit on the relevant entities in romania institutes research centers industrial companies and smes which have space technological capabilities the audit was conducted by esa based on a sample of 130 entities for 50 of them being organized technical visits and interviews
the full member state of the european space agency status gives to the organizations in romania access in the same way with the esa countries to all programs run and this is an important technology transfer and the opening of a high-tech market also the intellectual property is maintained at a national level having an important role in the establishment of competence in the country


 research 


 rosa research center 
the rosa research center rrc was organized in 1998 as an entity legally represented by rosa rrc joined all research capacities in a unique management another step was the joint venture agreements concluded with cruta – the romanian center for remote sensing applications in agriculture – a sme laboratory initially organized as an independent branch of the ispif research and development institute for land use a joint venture agreement was concluded with the institute of space science in bucharest since 2001 the rrc has been selected by the ministry of education and research as a center of excellence in space applications
since 2006 on behalf of the romanian government rosa strengthened its relationship with esa by signing a pecs agreement
the fields of science and technology knowledge developed by rrc are space dynamics in particular small satellites and tethered systems magnetic fluids and magneto-fluidic composites earth observation remote sensing satellite data retrieval processing algorithms and software development applications development spatial information systems integration global navigation satellite systems and space technology for risk management and securityrrc developed since 2003 rd projects addressing national strategy as well as technological development in the gnss field one of the last projects “capacity infrastructure and applications for gnss-galileo” directly addressed the problem of extending egnos in eastern europe through infrastructure development
