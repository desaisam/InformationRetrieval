belgium controlled two colonies during its history the belgian congo from 1908 to 1960 and ruanda-urundi from 1916 to 1962 it also had a concession in china and was a co-administrator of the tangier international zone in morocco
roughly 98% of belgiums overseas territory was just one colony about 76 times larger than belgium itself — known as the belgian congo this had originated as the personal property of the countrys king leopold ii rather than being gained through the political or military action of the belgian state sovereignty was transferred to belgium in 1908


 background 
belgium a constitutional monarchy received its independence in 1830 after a revolution against the dutch government of the united kingdom of the netherlands by the time belgian independence was universally recognized in 1839 most european powers already had colonies and protectorates outside europe and had begun to form spheres of influence
during the 1840s and 50s king leopold i tentatively supported several proposals to acquire territories overseas in 1843 he signed a contract with ladd  co to colonize the kingdom of hawaii but the deal fell apart when ladd  co ran into financial difficulties belgian traders also extended their influence in  west africa but this too fell apart following the rio nuñez incident of 1849 and growing anglo-french rivalry in the region
by the time belgiums second king leopold ii was crowned belgian enthusiasm for colonialism had abated successive governments viewed colonial expansion as economically and politically risky and fundamentally unrewarding and believed that informal empire continuing belgiums booming industrial trade in south america and russia was much more promising as a result leopold pursued his colonial ambitions without the support of the belgian government

 major possessions 


 in the congo 


 congo free state 1885–1908 

colonization of the congo began in the late 19th century king leopold ii of belgium frustrated by his nations lack of international power and prestige tried to persuade the belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored congo basin their refusal led leopold to create a state under his own personal rule with support from a number of western countries who saw leopold as a useful buffer between rival colonial powers leopold achieved international recognition for the congo free state in 1885the free state government exploited the congo for its natural resources first ivory and later rubber which was becoming a valuable commodity with the support of the free states military the force publique the territory was divided into private concessions the anglo-belgian india rubber company abir among others used force and brutality to extract profit from the territory their regime in the congo used forced labour and murder and mutilation on indigenous congolese who did not fulfill quotas for rubber collections millions of congolese died during this time many deaths can be attributed to new diseases introduced by contact with european colonists including smallpox which killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower congo river

a sharp reduction of the population of the congo through excess deaths occurred in the free state period but estimates of the deaths toll vary considerably although the figures are estimates it is believed that as many as ten million congolese died during the period roughly a fifth of the population as the first census did not take place until 1924 it is difficult to quantify the population loss of the period and these figures have been disputed by some who like william rubinstein claim that the figures cited by adam hochschild are speculative estimates based on little evidencealthough the congo free state was not a belgian colony belgium was its chief beneficiary in terms of trade and the employment of its citizens leopold ii personally accumulated considerable wealth from exports of rubber and ivory acquired at gunpoint much of this was spent on public buildings in brussels ostend and antwerp


 belgian congo 1908–60 

leopold achieved international recognition for the congo free state in 1885 by the turn of the century however the violence used by free state officials against indigenous congolese and the ruthless system of economic extraction led to intense diplomatic pressure on belgium to take official control of the country which it did in 1908 creating the belgian congobelgian rule in the congo was based on the colonial trinity trinité coloniale of state missionary and private company interests the privileging of belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of capital flowed into the congo and that individual regions became specialised on many occasions the interests of the government and private enterprise became closely tied and the state helped companies break strikes and remove other barriers raised by the indigenous population the country was split into nesting hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions and run uniformly according to a set native policy politique indigène this was in contrast to the british and the french who generally favoured the system of indirect rule whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight during world war i congolese troops participated in offensives against german forces in the area of modern-day rwanda and burundi which were placed under belgian occupation the congo had a high degree of racial segregation the large numbers of white immigrants who moved to the congo after the end of world war ii came from across the social spectrum but were always treated as superior to blacks

congolese troops participated in world war ii and were instrumental in forcing the italians out of their east african colonies during the east african campaign during the 1940s and 1950s the congo had extensive urbanisation and the colonial administration began various development programmes aimed at making the territory into a model colony one of the results was the development of a new middle class of europeanised african évolués in the cities by the 1950s the congo had a wage labour force twice as large as that in any other african colonyin 1960 as the result of a widespread and increasingly radical pro-independence movement the congo achieved independence becoming the republic of congo-léopoldville under patrice lumumba and joseph kasa-vubu poor relations between factions within the congo the continued involvement of belgium in congolese affairs and intervention by major parties of the cold war led to a five-year-long period of war and political instability known as the congo crisis from 1960 to 1965 this ended with the seizure of power by joseph-désiré mobutu


 ruanda-urundi 1916–62 

ruanda-urundi was a part of german east africa under belgian military occupation from 1916 to 1924 in the aftermath of world war i when a military expedition had removed the germans from the colony it became a league of nations world b mandate allotted to belgium from 1924 to 1945 it was designated as a united nations trust territory still under belgian administration until 1962 when it developed into the independent states of rwanda and burundi after belgium began administering the colony it generally maintained the policies established by the germans  including indirect rule via local tutsi rulers and a policy of ethnic identity cards later retained in the republic of rwanda revolts and violence against tutsi known as the rwandan revolution occurred in the events leading to independence
