a space suit is a garment worn to keep a human alive in the harsh environment of outer space vacuum and temperature extremes space suits are often worn inside spacecraft as a safety precaution in case of loss of cabin pressure and are necessary for extravehicular activity eva work done outside spacecraft space suits have been worn for such work in earth orbit on the surface of the moon and en route back to earth from the moon modern space suits augment the basic pressure garment with a complex system of equipment and environmental systems designed to keep the wearer comfortable and to minimize the effort required to bend the limbs resisting a soft pressure garments natural tendency to stiffen against the vacuum a self-contained oxygen supply and environmental control system is frequently employed to allow complete freedom of movement independent of the spacecraft
three types of space suits exist for different purposes iva intravehicular activity eva extravehicular activity and ieva intraextravehicular activity iva suits are meant to be worn inside a pressurized spacecraft and are therefore lighter and more comfortable ieva suits are meant for use inside and outside the spacecraft such as the gemini g4c suit they include more protection from the harsh conditions of space such as protection from micrometeorites and extreme temperature change eva suits such as the emu are used outside spacecraft for either planetary exploration or spacewalks they must protect the wearer against all conditions of space as well as provide mobility and functionalitysome of these requirements also apply to pressure suits worn for other specialized tasks such as high-altitude reconnaissance flight at altitudes above the armstrong limit around 19,000 m 62,000 ft water boils at body temperature and pressurized suits are needed
the first full-pressure suits for use at extreme altitudes were designed by individual inventors as early as the 1930s the first space suit worn by a human in space was the soviet sk-1 suit worn by yuri gagarin in 1961


 requirements 

a space suit must perform several functions to allow its occupant to work safely and comfortably inside or outside a spacecraft it must provide

a stable internal pressure this can be less than earths atmosphere as there is usually no need for the space suit to carry nitrogen which comprises about 78% of earths atmosphere and is not used by the body lower pressure allows for greater mobility but requires the suit occupant to breathe pure oxygen for a time before going into this lower pressure to avoid decompression sickness
mobility movement is typically opposed by the pressure of the suit mobility is achieved by careful joint design see the theories of space suit design section
supply of breathable oxygen and elimination of carbon dioxide these gases are exchanged with the spacecraft or a portable life support system plss
temperature regulation unlike on earth where heat can be transferred by convection to the atmosphere in space heat can be lost only by thermal radiation or by conduction to objects in physical contact with the exterior of the suit since the temperature on the outside of the suit varies greatly between sunlight and shadow the suit is heavily insulated and air temperature is maintained at a comfortable level
a communication system with external electrical connection to the spacecraft or plss
means of collecting and containing solid and liquid bodily waste such as a maximum absorbency garment


 secondary requirements 

advanced suits better regulate the astronauts temperature with a liquid cooling and ventilation garment lcvg in contact with the astronauts skin from which the heat is dumped into space through an external radiator in the plss
additional requirements for eva include

shielding against ultraviolet radiation
limited shielding against particle radiation
means to maneuver dock release andor tether onto a spacecraft
protection against small micrometeoroids some traveling at up to 27,000 kilometers per hour provided by a puncture-resistant thermal micrometeoroid garment which is the outermost layer of the suit experience has shown the greatest chance of exposure occurs near the gravitational field of a moon or planet so these were first employed on the apollo lunar eva suits see united states suit models belowas part of astronautical hygiene control ie protecting astronauts from extremes of temperature radiation etc a space suit is essential for extravehicular activity the apolloskylab a7l suit included eleven layers in all an inner liner a lcvg a pressure bladder a restraint layer another liner and a thermal micrometeoroid garment consisting of five aluminized insulation layers and an external layer of white ortho-fabric this space suit is capable of protecting the astronaut from temperatures ranging from −156 °c −249 °f to 121 °c 250 °fduring exploration of the moon or mars there will be the potential for lunarmartian dust to be retained on the space suit when the space suit is removed on return to the spacecraft there will be the potential for the dust to contaminate surfaces and increase the risks of inhalation and skin exposure astronautical hygienists are testing materials with reduced dust retention times and the potential to control the dust exposure risks during planetary exploration novel ingressegress approaches such as suitports are being explored as well
in nasa space suits communications are provided via a cap worn over the head which includes earphones and a microphone due to the coloration of the version used for apollo and skylab which resembled the coloration of the comic strip character snoopy these caps became known as snoopy caps


 operating pressure 

generally to supply enough oxygen for respiration a space suit using pure oxygen must have a pressure of about 32.4 kpa 240 torr 4.7 psi equal to the 20.7 kpa 160 torr 3.0 psi partial pressure of oxygen in the earths atmosphere at sea level plus 5.3 kpa 40 torr 0.77 psi co2 and 6.3 kpa 47 torr 0.91 psi water vapor pressure both of which must be subtracted from the alveolar pressure to get alveolar oxygen partial pressure in 100% oxygen atmospheres by the alveolar gas equation the latter two figures add to 11.6 kpa 87 torr 1.7 psi which is why many modern space suits do not use 20.7 kpa 160 torr 3.0 psi but 32.4 kpa 240 torr 4.7 psi this is a slight overcorrection as alveolar partial pressures at sea level are slightly less than the former in space suits that use 20.7 kpa the astronaut gets only 20.7 kpa − 11.7 kpa  9.0 kpa 68 torr 1.3 psi of oxygen which is about the alveolar oxygen partial pressure attained at an altitude of 1,860 m 6,100 ft above sea level this is about 78% of normal partial pressure of oxygen at sea level about the same as pressure in a commercial passenger jet aircraft and is the realistic lower limit for safe ordinary space suit pressurization which allows reasonable capacity for work
when space suits below a specific operating pressure are used from craft that are pressurized to normal atmospheric pressure such as the space shuttle this requires astronauts to pre-breathe meaning pre-breathe pure oxygen for a period before donning their suits and depressurizing in the air lock this procedure purges the body of dissolved nitrogen so as to avoid decompression sickness due to rapid depressurization from a nitrogen-containing atmosphere


 physical effects of unprotected space exposure 

the human body can briefly survive the hard vacuum of space unprotected despite contrary depictions in some popular science fiction human flesh expands to about twice its size in such conditions giving the visual effect of a body builder rather than an overfilled balloon consciousness is retained for up to 15 seconds as the effects of oxygen starvation set in no snap freeze effect occurs because all heat must be lost through thermal radiation or the evaporation of liquids and the blood does not boil because it remains pressurized within the body
in space there are many different highly energized subatomic protons that will expose the body to extreme radiation although these compounds are minimal in amount their high energy is liable to disrupt essential physical and chemical processes in the body such as altering dna or causing cancers exposure to radiation can create problems via two methods the particles can react with water in the human body to produce free radicals that break dna molecules apart or by directly breaking the dna moleculestemperature in space can vary extremely depending on where the sun is temperatures from solar radiation can reach up to 250 °f 121 °c and lower down to −387 °f −233 °c because of this space suits must provide proper insulation and coolingthe vacuum in space creates zero pressure causing the gases and processes in the body to expand in order to prevent chemical processes in the body from overreacting it is necessary to develop a suit that counteracts against the pressure in space the greatest danger is in attempting to hold ones breath before exposure as the subsequent explosive decompression can damage the lungs these effects have been confirmed through various accidents including in very-high-altitude conditions outer space and training vacuum chambers human skin does not need to be protected from vacuum and is gas-tight by itself instead it only needs to be mechanically compressed to retain its normal shape this can be accomplished with a tight-fitting elastic body suit and a helmet for containing breathing gases known as a space activity suit sas


 design concepts 
a space suit should allow its user natural unencumbered movement nearly all designs try to maintain a constant volume no matter what movements the wearer makes this is because mechanical work is needed to change the volume of a constant pressure system if flexing a joint reduces the volume of the space suit then the astronaut must do extra work every time he bends that joint and he has to maintain a force to keep the joint bent even if this force is very small it can be seriously fatiguing to constantly fight against ones suit it also makes delicate movements very difficult the work required to bend a joint is dictated by the formula

  
    
      
        w
        
        
          ∫
          
            
              v
              
                i
              
            
          
          
            
              v
              
                f
              
            
          
        
        
        p
        
        d
        v
      
    
    displaystyle wint vivfpdv
  where vi and vf are respectively the initial and final volume of the joint p is the pressure in the suit and w is the resultant work it is generally true that all suits are more mobile at lower pressures however because a minimum internal pressure is dictated by life support requirements the only means of further reducing work is to minimize the change in volume
all space suit designs try to minimize or eliminate this problem the most common solution is to form the suit out of multiple layers the bladder layer is a rubbery airtight layer much like a balloon the restraint layer goes outside the bladder and provides a specific shape for the suit since the bladder layer is larger than the restraint layer the restraint takes all of the stresses caused by the pressure inside the suit since the bladder is not under pressure it will not pop like a balloon even if punctured the restraint layer is shaped in such a way that bending a joint causes pockets of fabric called gores to open up on the outside of the joint while folds called convolutes fold up on the inside of the joint the gores make up for the volume lost on the inside of the joint and keep the suit at a nearly constant volume however once the gores are opened all the way the joint cannot be bent any further without a considerable amount of work
in some russian space suits strips of cloth were wrapped tightly around the cosmonauts arms and legs outside the space suit to stop the space suit from ballooning when in spacethe outermost layer of a space suit the thermal micrometeoroid garment provides thermal insulation protection from micrometeoroids and shielding from harmful solar radiation
there are four main conceptual approaches to suit design


 soft suits 
soft suits typically are made mostly of fabrics all soft suits have some hard parts some even have hard joint bearings intra-vehicular activity and early eva suits were soft suits


 hard-shell suits 
hard-shell suits are usually made of metal or composite materials and do not use fabric for joints hard suits joints use ball bearings and wedge-ring segments similar to an adjustable elbow of a stove pipe to allow a wide range of movement with the arms and legs the joints maintain a constant volume of air internally and do not have any counter force therefore the astronaut does not need to exert to hold the suit in any position hard suits can also operate at higher pressures which would eliminate the need for an astronaut to pre-breathe oxygen to use a 34 kpa 4.9 psi space suit before an eva from a 101 kpa 14.6 psi spacecraft cabin the joints may get into a restricted or locked position requiring the astronaut to manipulate or program the joint the nasa ames research center experimental ax-5 hard-shell space suit had a flexibility rating of 95 the wearer could move into 95% of the positions he or she could while nude


 hybrid suits 
hybrid suits have hard-shell parts and fabric parts nasas extravehicular mobility unit emu uses a fiberglass hard upper torso hut and fabric limbs ilc dovers i-suit replaces the hut with a fabric soft upper torso to save weight restricting the use of hard components to the joint bearings helmet waist seal and rear entry hatch virtually all workable space suit designs incorporate hard components particularly at interfaces such as the waist seal bearings and in the case of rear-entry suits the back hatch where all-soft alternatives are not viable


 skintight suits 

skintight suits also known as mechanical counterpressure suits or space activity suits are a proposed design which would use a heavy elastic body stocking to compress the body the head is in a pressurized helmet but the rest of the body is pressurized only by the elastic effect of the suit this mitigates the constant volume problem reduces the possibility of a space suit depressurization and gives a very lightweight suit when not worn the elastic garments may appear to be that of clothing for a small child these suits may be very difficult to put on and face problems with providing a uniform pressure most proposals use the bodys natural perspiration to keep cool sweat evaporates readily in vacuum and may desublime or deposit on objects nearby optics sensors the astronauts visor and other surfaces  the icy film and sweat residue may contaminate sensitive surfaces and affect optical performance


 contributing technologies 
related preceding technologies include the gas mask used in world war ii the oxygen mask used by pilots of high flying bombers in world war ii the high altitude or vacuum suit required by pilots of the lockheed u-2 and sr-71 blackbird the diving suit rebreather scuba diving gear and many others
many space suit designs are taken from the us air force suits which are designed to work in “high altitude aircraft pressures” such as the mercury iva suit or the gemini g4c or the advanced crew escape suits


 glove technology 
the mercury iva the first us space suit design included lights at the tips of the gloves in order to provide visual aid as the need for extravehicular activity grew suits such as the apollo a7l included gloves made of a metal fabric called chromel-r in order to prevent punctures in order to retain a better sense of touch for the astronauts the fingertips of the gloves were made of silicone with the shuttle program it became necessary to be able to operate spacecraft modules so the aces suits featured gripping on the gloves emu gloves which are used for spacewalks are heated to keep the astronauts hands warm the phase vi gloves meant for use with the mark iii suit are the first gloves to be designed with laser scanning technology 3d computer modeling stereo lithography laser cutting technology and cnc machining  this allows for cheaper more accurate production as well as increased detail in joint mobility and flexibility


 life support technology 
prior to the apollo missions life support in space suits was connected to the space capsule via an umbilical cord-like device however with the apollo missions life support was configured into a removable capsule called the portable life support system that allowed the astronaut to explore the moon without having to be attached to the space craft the emu space suit used for spacewalks allows the astronaut to manually control the internal environment of the suit the mark iii suit has a backpack filled with about 12 pounds of liquid air as well as pressurization and heat exchange


 helmet technology 
the development of the spheroidal dome helmet was key in balancing the need for field of view pressure compensation and low weight one inconvenience with some space suits is the head being fixed facing forwards and being unable to turn to look sideways astronauts call this effect alligator head


 high-altitude suits 

evgeniy chertovsky created his full-pressure suit or high-altitude skafandr скафандр in 1931 скафандр also means diving apparatus
emilio herrera linares designed and built a full-pressure suit escafandra estratonáutica in 1935 which was to have been used during an open-basket balloon stratospheric flight scheduled for early 1936
wiley post experimented with a number of pressure suits for record-breaking flights
russell colley created the space suits worn by the project mercury astronauts including fitting alan shepard for his ride as americas first man in space on may 5 1961

 emerging technologies 
several companies and universities are developing technologies and prototypes which represent improvements over current space suits


 additive manufacturing 
3d printing additive manufacturing can be used to reduce the mass of hard-shell space suits while retaining the high mobility they provide this fabrication method also allows for the potential for in-situ fabrication and repair of suits a capability which is not currently available but will likely be necessary for martian exploration the university of maryland began development of a prototype 3d printed hard suit in 2016 based on the kinematics of the ax-5 the prototype arm segment is designed to be evaluated in the space systems laboratory glovebox to compare mobility to traditional soft suits initial research has focused on the feasibility of printing rigid suit elements bearing races ball bearings seals and sealing surfaces


 astronaut glove challenge 
there are certain difficulties in designing a dexterous space suit glove and there are limitations to the current designs for this reason the centennial astronaut glove challenge was created to build a better glove competitions have been held in 2007 and 2009 and another is planned the 2009 contest required the glove to be covered with a micro-meteorite layer


 aoudax 

since 2009 the austrian space forum has been developing aoudax an experimental mars analogue space suit focusing on an advanced human-machine interface and on-board computing network to increase situational awareness the suit is designed to study contamination vectors in planetary exploration analogue environments and create limitations depending on the pressure regime chosen for a simulation
since 2012 for the mars2013 analogue mission by the austrian space forum to erfoud morocco the aoudax analogue space suit has a sister in the form of aoudas this is a slightly less sophisticated suit meant primarily to assist aoudax operations and be able to study the interactions between two analogue astronauts in similar suits
the aoudax and aoudas space suits have been named after the fictional princess from the jules vernes 1873 novel around the world in eighty days and can be followed on facebook a public display mock-up of aoudax called aoudad is currently on display at the dachstein ice cave in obertraun austria after the experiments done there in 2012


 bio-suit 
bio-suit is a space activity suit under development at the massachusetts institute of technology which as of  2006 consisted of several lower leg prototypes bio-suit is custom fit to each wearer using laser body scanning


 constellation space suit system 
on august 2 2006 nasa indicated plans to issue a request for proposal rfp for the design development certification production and sustaining engineering of the constellation space suit to meet the needs of the constellation program nasa foresees a single suit capable of supporting survivability during launch entry and abort zero-gravity eva lunar surface eva and mars surface eva
on june 11 2008 nasa awarded a usd745 million contract to oceaneering international to create the new space suit


 final frontier design iva space suit 

final frontier design ffd is developing a commercial full iva space suit with their first suit completed in 2010 ffds suits are intended as a light-weight highly mobile and inexpensive commercial space suits since 2011 ffd has upgraded iva suits designs hardware processes and capabilities ffd has built a total of 7 iva space suit 2016 assemblies for various institutions and customers since founding and has conducted high fidelity human testing in simulators aircraft microgravity and hypobaric chambers ffd has a space act agreement with nasa’s commercial space capabilities office to develop and execute a human rating plan for ffd iva suit ffd categorizes their iva suits according to their mission terra for earth-based testing stratos for high altitude flights and exos for orbital space flights each suit category has different requirements for manufacturing controls validations and materials but are of a similar architecture


 i-suit 
the i-suit is a space suit prototype also constructed by ilc dover which incorporates several design improvements over the emu including a weight-saving soft upper torso both the mark iii and the i-suit have taken part in nasas annual desert research and technology studies d-rats field trials during which suit occupants interact with one another and with rovers and other equipment


 mark iii 
the mark iii is a nasa prototype constructed by ilc dover which incorporates a hard lower torso section and a mix of soft and hard components the mark iii is markedly more mobile than previous suits despite its high operating pressure 57 kpa or 8.3 psi which makes it a zero-prebreathe suit meaning that astronauts would be able to transition directly from a one atmosphere mixed-gas space station environment such as that on the international space station to the suit without risking decompression sickness which can occur with rapid depressurization from an atmosphere containing nitrogen or another inert gas


 mx-2 
the mx-2 is a space suit analogue constructed at the university of marylands space systems laboratory the mx-2 is used for manned neutral buoyancy testing at the space systems labs neutral buoyancy research facility by approximating the work envelope of a real eva suit without meeting the requirements of a flight-rated suit the mx-2 provides an inexpensive platform for eva research compared to using emu suits at facilities like nasas neutral buoyancy laboratory
the mx-2 has an operating pressure of 2.5–4 psi it is a rear-entry suit featuring a fiberglass hut air lcvg cooling water and power are open loop systems provided through an umbilical the suit contains a mac mini computer to capture sensor data such as suit pressure inlet and outlet air temperatures and heart rate resizable suit elements and adjustable ballast allow the suit to accommodate subjects ranging in height from 68 to 75 inches 170–190 cm and with a weight range of 120 lb 54 kg


 north dakota suit 
beginning in may 2006 five north dakota colleges collaborated on a new space suit prototype funded by a usd100,000 grant from nasa to demonstrate technologies which could be incorporated into a planetary suit the suit was tested in the theodore roosevelt national park badlands of western north dakota the suit has a mass of 47 pounds 21 kg without a life support backpack and costs only a fraction of the standard usd12,000,000 cost for a flight-rated nasa space suit  the suit was developed in just over a year by students from the university of north dakota north dakota state dickinson state the state college of science and turtle mountain community college the mobility of the north dakota suit can be attributed to its low operating pressure while the north dakota suit was field tested at a pressure of 1 psi 6.9 kpa 52 torr differential nasas emu suit operates at a pressure of 4.7 psi 32 kpa 240 torr a pressure designed to supply approximately sea-level oxygen partial pressure for respiration see discussion above


 pxs 
nasas prototype exploration suit pxs like the z-series is a rear-entry suit compatible with suitports the suit has components which could be 3d printed during missions to a range of specifications to fit different individuals or changing mobility requirements


 spacex suit 

in february 2015 spacex began developing a space suit for astronauts to wear within the dragon 2 space capsule the first images of the suit were revealed in september 2017 a mannequin wore the spacex space suit during the maiden launch of the falcon heavy in february 2018 according to musk the spacex suit is intended for intravehicular activity use only iva type meant to be worn inside a pressurized spacecraft for this exhibition launch the suit was not pressurized and carried no sensorsin 2018 nasa commercial crew astronauts bob behnken and doug hurley tested the spacesuit inside the dragon 2 spacecraft in order to familiarize themselves with the suit


 suitports 
a suitport is a theoretical alternative to an airlock designed for use in hazardous environments and in human spaceflight especially planetary surface exploration in a suitport system a rear-entry space suit is attached and sealed against the outside of a spacecraft such that an astronaut can enter and seal up the suit then go on eva without the need for an airlock or depressurizing the spacecraft cabin suitports require less mass and volume than airlocks provide dust mitigation and prevent cross-contamination of the inside and outside environments patents for suitport designs were filed in 1996 by philip culbertson jr of nasas ames research center and in 2003 by joerg boettcher stephen ransom and frank steinsiek


 z-series 

in 2012 nasa introduced the z-1 space suit the first in the z-series of space suit prototypes designed by nasa specifically for planetary extravehicular activity the z-1 space suit includes an emphasis on mobility and protection for space missions it features a soft torso versus the hard torsos seen in previous nasa eva space suits which provides reduced mass it has been labeled the buzz lightyear suit due to its green streaks for a design
in 2014 nasa released the design for the z-2 prototype the next model in the z-series nasa conducted a poll asking the public to decide on a design for the z-2 space suit the designs created by fashion students from philadelphia university were technology trends in society and biomimicry the design technology won and the prototype is built with technologies like 3d printing the z-2 suit will also differ from the z-1 suit in that the torso reverts to the hard shell as seen in nasas emu suit


 in fiction 
the earliest space fiction ignored the problems of traveling through a vacuum and launched its heroes through space without any special protection  in the later 19th century however a more realistic brand of space fiction emerged in which authors have tried to describe or depict the space suits worn by their characters  these fictional suits vary in appearance and technology and range from the highly authentic to the utterly improbable
a very early fictional account of space suits can be seen in garrett p serviss novel edisons conquest of mars 1898  later comic book series such as buck rogers 1930s and dan dare 1950s also featured their own takes on space suit design science fiction authors such as robert a heinlein contributed to the development of fictional space suit concepts
