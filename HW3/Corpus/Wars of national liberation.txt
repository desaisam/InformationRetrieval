wars of national liberation or national liberation revolutions are conflicts fought by nations to gain independence the term is used in conjunction with wars against foreign powers or at least those perceived as foreign to establish separate sovereign states for the rebelling nationality from a different point of view these wars are called insurgencies rebellions or wars of independence guerrilla warfare or asymmetric warfare is often utilized by groups labeled as national liberation movements often with support from other states
the term wars of national liberation is most commonly used for those fought during the decolonization movement since these were primarily in the third world against western powers and their economic influence and a major aspect of the cold war the phrase itself has often been viewed as biased or pejorative some of these wars were either vocally or materially supported by the soviet union which stated itself to be an anti-imperialist power supporting the replacement of western-backed governments with local communist or other non pro-western parties  however this did not always guarantee soviet influence in those countries in addition to and increasingly in competition to the soviet union the peoples republic of china presented themselves as models of independent nationalist development outside of western influence particularly as such posturing and other longterm hostility meant they were regarded as a threat to western power and regarded themselves as such using their resources to politically economically and militarily assist movements such as in vietnam in january 1961 soviet premier nikita khrushchev pledged support for wars of national liberation throughout the worldthe communist concept of imperialism that was used to underline soviet and chinese involvement in these struggles and its relations to colonies had been theorized in vladimir lenins 1916 book imperialism the highest stage of capitalism while ho chi minh who founded the viet-minh in 1930 and declared the independence of vietnam on september 2 1945 following the 1945 august revolution was a founding member of the french communist party pcf in 1921


 legal issues 
international law generally holds that a people with a legal right to self-determination are entitled to wage wars of national liberation while western states tend to view these wars as civil wars third world and communist states tend to view them as international wars this difference in classification leads to varying perceptions of which laws of war apply in such situations however there is general agreement among all states today in principle that the use of force to frustrate a peoples legal right to self-determination is unlawful


 strategies and tactics 
wars of national liberation are usually fought using guerrilla warfare the main purpose of these tactics is to increase the cost of the anti-guerrilla forces past the point where such forces are willing to bear wars of national liberation generally depend a large amounts of public support with ordinary civilians providing crucial support  finally wars of national liberation are often embedded in a larger context of great power politics and are often proxy wars
these strategies explain why they are quite successful against foreign regimes and quite unsuccessful against indigenous regimes  foreign regimes usually have a threshold beyond which they would prefer to go home rather than to fight the war  by contrast an indigenous regime has no place to go to and will fight much harder because of the lack of alternatives  moreover foreign regimes usually have relatively few active supporters who can often be easily identified making it possible for guerrilla armies to operate  by contrast indigenous regimes often have much more popular support and their supporters are not as easily recognized making it much harder to conduct guerrilla operations
