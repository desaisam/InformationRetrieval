taiwan officially the republic of china roc is a state in east asia neighbouring states include the peoples republic of china prc to the west japan to the northeast and the philippines to the south taiwan is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the united nations un
the island of taiwan was inhabited by indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the 17th century when dutch colonialists opened the island to mass han immigration after a brief rule by the kingdom of tungning the island was annexed in 1683 by the qing dynasty of china and ceded to japan in 1895 following the surrender of japan in 1945 the republic of china which had overthrown and succeeded the qing in 1911 took control of taiwan the resumption of the chinese civil war led to the loss of the mainland to the communists and the flight of the roc government to taiwan in 1949 although the roc government continued to claim to be the legitimate representative of china since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to taiwan and several small islands in the early 1960s taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialisation in the 1980s and early 1990s it changed from a one-party military dictatorship to a multi-party democracy with a semi-presidential system
as a founding member the roc represented china in the un until it was replaced by the prc in 1971 the prc has consistently claimed sovereignty over taiwan and refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognises the roc as of 2019 taiwan maintains official ties with 17 out of 193 un member states most international organisations in which the prc participates either refuse to grant membership to taiwan or allow it to participate only as a non-state actor nevertheless most major powers maintain unofficial ties with taiwan through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates in taiwan the major political division is between parties favouring eventual chinese unification and promoting a chinese identity contrasted with those aspiring to independence and promoting a taiwanese identity though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appealtaiwan is a high-income advanced economy with a highly skilled and educated workforce it has the 22nd-largest economy in the world and its high-tech industry plays a key role in the global economy it is highly urbanised and is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with most of the population concentrated on the western coast the state is ranked highly in terms of civil and political liberties education health care  and human development


 etymology 

various names for the island of taiwan remain in use today each derived from explorers or rulers during a particular historical period the name formosa 福爾摩沙 dates from 1542 when portuguese sailors sighted an uncharted island and noted it on their maps as ilha formosa beautiful island the name formosa eventually replaced all others in european literature and remained in common use among english speakers into the 20th centuryin the early 17th century the dutch east india company established a commercial post at fort zeelandia modern-day anping tainan on a coastal sandbar called tayouan after their ethnonym for a nearby taiwanese aboriginal tribe possibly taivoan people written by the dutch and portuguese variously as taiouwang tayowan teijoan etc this name was also adopted into the chinese vernacular in particular hokkien as pe̍h-ōe-jī tāi-oântâi-oân as the name of the sandbar and nearby area tainan the modern word taiwan is derived from this usage which is seen in various forms 大員 大圓 大灣 臺員 臺圓 and 臺窩灣 in chinese historical records the area occupied by modern-day tainan represented the first permanent settlement by both european colonists and chinese immigrants the settlement grew to be the islands most important trading centre and served as its capital until 1887 use of the current chinese name 臺灣 became official as early as 1684 with the establishment of taiwan prefecture through its rapid development the entire formosan mainland eventually became known as taiwanin his daoyi zhilüe 1349 wang dayuan used liuqiu as a name for the island of taiwan or the part of it closest to penghu
elsewhere the name was used for the ryukyu islands in general or okinawa the largest of them indeed the name ryūkyū is the japanese form of liúqiú
the name also appears in the book of sui 636 and other early works but scholars cannot agree on whether these references are to the ryukyus taiwan or even luzonthe official name of the state is the republic of china it has also been known under various names throughout its existence shortly after the rocs establishment in 1912 while it was still located on the chinese mainland the government used the short form china zhōngguó 中國 to refer to itself which derives from zhōng central or middle and guó state nation-state a term which also developed under the zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne and the name was then applied to the area around luoyi present-day luoyang during the eastern zhou and then to chinas central plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state during the qing era during the 1950s and 1960s after the government had withdrawn to taiwan upon losing the chinese civil war it was commonly referred to as nationalist china or free china to differentiate it from communist china or red china it was a member of the united nations representing china until 1971 when it lost its seat to the peoples republic of china over subsequent decades the republic of china has become commonly known as taiwan after the island that comprises 99% of the territory under its control in some contexts especially roc government publications the name is written as republic of china taiwan republic of chinataiwan or sometimes taiwan roc  the republic of china participates in most international forums and organizations under the name chinese taipei due to diplomatic pressure from the peoples republic of china for instance it is the name under which it has competed at the olympic games since 1984 and its name as an observer at the world health organization


 history 


 prehistory 

taiwan was joined to the mainland in the late pleistocene until sea levels rose about 10,000 years ago fragmentary human remains dated 20,000 to 30,000 years ago have been found on the island as well as later artifacts of a paleolithic culturearound 6,000 years ago taiwan was settled by farmers most likely from mainland china they are believed to be the ancestors of todays taiwanese aborigines whose languages belong to the austronesian language family but show much greater diversity than the rest of the family which spans a huge area from maritime southeast asia west to madagascar and east as far as new zealand hawaii and easter island this has led linguists to propose taiwan as the urheimat of the family from which seafaring peoples dispersed across southeast asia and the pacific and indian oceanshan chinese fishermen began settling in the penghu islands in the 13th century hostile tribes and a lack of valuable trade products meant that few outsiders visited the main island until the 16th century during the 16th century visits to the coast by fishermen from fujian as well as chinese and japanese pirates became more frequent


 opening in the 17th century 

the dutch east india company attempted to establish a trading outpost on the penghu islands pescadores in 1622 but were driven off by ming forcesin 1624 the company established a stronghold called fort zeelandia on the coastal islet of tayouan which is now part of the main island at anping tainan
when the dutch arrived they found southwestern taiwan already frequented by a transient chinese population numbering close to 1,500
david wright a scottish agent of the company who lived on the island in the 1650s described the lowland areas of the island as being divided among 11 chiefdoms ranging in size from two settlements to 72 some of these fell under dutch control while others remained independent the company began to import labourers from fujian and penghu pescadores many of whom settledin 1626 the spanish empire landed on and occupied northern taiwan at the ports of keelung and tamsui as a base to extend their trading this colonial period lasted 16 years until 1642 when the last spanish fortress fell to dutch forces
following the fall of the ming dynasty koxinga zheng chenggong a self-styled ming loyalist arrived on the island and captured fort zeelandia in 1662 expelling the dutch empire and military from the island koxinga established the kingdom of tungning 1662–1683 with his capital at tainan he and his heirs zheng jing who ruled from 1662 to 1682 and zheng keshuang who ruled less than a year continued to launch raids on the southeast coast of mainland china well into the qing dynasty era


 qing rule 

in 1683 following the defeat of koxingas grandson by an armada led by admiral shi lang of southern fujian the qing dynasty formally annexed taiwan placing it under the jurisdiction of fujian province the qing imperial government tried to reduce piracy and vagrancy in the area issuing a series of edicts to manage immigration and respect aboriginal land rights immigrants mostly from southern fujian continued to enter taiwan the border between taxpaying lands and what was considered savage lands shifted eastward with some aborigines becoming sinicized while others retreated into the mountains during this time there were a number of conflicts between groups of han chinese from different regions of southern fujian particularly between those from quanzhou and zhangzhou and between southern fujian chinese and aborigines
northern taiwan and the penghu islands were the scene of subsidiary campaigns in the sino-french war august 1884 to april 1885 the french occupied keelung on 1 october 1884 but were repulsed from tamsui a few days later the french won some tactical victories but were unable to exploit them and the keelung campaign ended in stalemate the pescadores campaign beginning on 31 march 1885 was a french victory but had no long-term consequences the french evacuated both keelung and the penghu archipelago after the end of the war
in 1887 the qing upgraded the islands administration from taiwan prefecture of fujian province to fujian-taiwan-province the twentieth in the empire with its capital at taipei this was accompanied by a modernization drive that included building chinas first railroad


 japanese rule 

as the qing dynasty was defeated in the first sino-japanese war 1894–1895 taiwan along with penghu and liaodong peninsula were ceded in full sovereignty to the empire of japan by the treaty of shimonoseki inhabitants on taiwan and penghu wishing to remain qing subjects were given a two-year grace period to sell their property and move to mainland china very few taiwanese saw this as feasible on 25 may 1895 a group of pro-qing high officials proclaimed the republic of formosa to resist impending japanese rule japanese forces entered the capital at tainan and quelled this resistance on 21 october 1895 guerrilla fighting continued periodically until about 1902 and ultimately took the lives of 14,000 taiwanese or 0.5% of the population several subsequent rebellions against the japanese the beipu uprising of 1907 the tapani incident of 1915 and the musha incident of 1930 were all unsuccessful but demonstrated opposition to japanese colonial rule
japanese colonial rule was instrumental in the industrialization of the island extending the railroads and other transportation networks building an extensive sanitation system and establishing a formal education system japanese rule ended the practice of headhunting during this period the human and natural resources of taiwan were used to aid the development of japan and the production of cash crops such as rice and sugar greatly increased by 1939 taiwan was the seventh greatest sugar producer in the world still the taiwanese and aborigines were classified as second- and third-class citizens after suppressing chinese guerrillas in the first decade of their rule japanese authorities engaged in a series of bloody campaigns against the mountain aboriginals culminating in the musha incident of 1930 intellectuals and laborers who participated in left-wing movements within taiwan were also arrested and massacred eg chiang wei-shui 蔣渭水 and masanosuke watanabe 渡辺政之輔around 1935 the japanese began an island-wide assimilation project to bind the island more firmly to the japanese empire and people were taught to see themselves as japanese under the kominka movement during which time taiwanese culture and religion were outlawed and the citizens were encouraged to adopt japanese surnames by 1938 309,000 japanese settlers resided in taiwantaiwan held strategic wartime importance as imperial japanese military campaigns first expanded and then contracted over the course of world war ii the south strike group was based at the taihoku imperial university in taipei during world war ii tens of thousands of taiwanese served in the japanese military over 2,000 women euphemistically called comfort women were forced into sexual slavery for imperial japanese troopsthe imperial japanese navy operated heavily out of taiwanese ports in october 1944 the formosa air battle was fought between american carriers and japanese forces based in taiwan important japanese military bases and industrial centres throughout taiwan such as kaohsiung and keelung were targets of heavy raids by american bombersafter japans surrender ended world war ii most of taiwans approximately 300,000 japanese residents were expelled and sent to japan


 republic of china 

while taiwan was still under japanese rule the republic of china was founded on the mainland on 1 january 1912 following the xinhai revolution which began with the wuchang uprising on 10 october 1911 replacing the qing dynasty and ending over two thousand years of imperial rule in china from its founding until 1949 it was based in mainland china central authority waxed and waned in response to warlordism 1915–28 japanese invasion 1937–45 and the chinese civil war 1927–50 with central authority strongest during the nanjing decade 1927–37 when most of china came under the control of the kuomintang kmt under an authoritarian one-party stateafter the surrender of japan on 25 october 1945 the us navy ferried roc troops to taiwan in order to accept the formal surrender of japanese military forces in taipei on behalf of the allied powers as part of general order no 1 for temporary military occupation general rikichi andō governor-general of taiwan and commander-in-chief of all japanese forces on the island signed the receipt and handed it over to general chen yi of the roc military to complete the official turnover chen yi proclaimed that day to be taiwan retrocession day but the allies considered taiwan and the penghu islands to be under military occupation and still under japanese sovereignty until 1952 when the treaty of san francisco took effect
although the 1943 cairo declaration had envisaged returning these territories to china in the treaty of san francisco and treaty of taipei japan renounced all claim to them without specifying to what country they were to be surrendered this introduced the problem of the legal status of taiwan
the roc administration of taiwan under chen yi was strained by increasing tensions between taiwanese-born people and newly arrived mainlanders which were compounded by economic woes such as hyperinflation furthermore cultural and linguistic conflicts between the two groups quickly led to the loss of popular support for the new government while the mass movement led by the working committee of the communist party also aimed to bring down the kuomintang government the shooting of a civilian on 28 february 1947 triggered island-wide unrest which was suppressed with military force in what is now called the february 28 incident mainstream estimates of the number killed range from 18,000 to 30,000 those killed were mainly members of the taiwanese elite

after the end of world war ii the chinese civil war resumed between the chinese nationalists kuomintang led by chiang kai-shek and the communist party of china led by mao zedong throughout the months of 1949 a series of chinese communist offensives led to the capture of its capital nanjing on 23 april and the subsequent defeat of the nationalist army on the mainland and the communists founded the peoples republic of china on 1 octoberon 7 december 1949 after the loss of four capitals chiang evacuated his nationalist government to taiwan and made taipei the temporary capital of the roc also called the wartime capital by chiang kai-shek some 2 million people consisting mainly of soldiers members of the ruling kuomintang and intellectual and business elites were evacuated from mainland china to taiwan at that time adding to the earlier population of approximately six million in addition the roc government took to taipei many national treasures and much of chinas gold reserves and foreign currency reservesafter losing most of the mainland the kuomintang held remaining control of tibet the portions of qinghai xinjiang and yunnan provinces along with the hainan island until 1951 before the communists subsequently captured these territories from this point onwards the kuomintangs territory was reduced to taiwan penghu kinmen and matsu islands fujian province and two major islands of dongsha islands and nansha islands the kuomintang continued to claim sovereignty over all china which it defined to include mainland china taiwan outer mongolia and other areas on mainland china the victorious communists claimed they ruled the sole and only china which they claimed included taiwan and that the republic of china no longer existed


 chinese nationalist one-party rule 
martial law declared on taiwan in may 1949 continued to be in effect after the central government relocated to taiwan it was not repealed until 1987 and was used as a way to suppress the political opposition in the intervening years during the white terror as the period is known 140,000 people were imprisoned or executed for being perceived as anti-kmt or pro-communist many citizens were arrested tortured imprisoned and executed for their real or perceived link to the communists since these people were mainly from the intellectual and social elite an entire generation of political and social leaders was decimated in 1998 law was passed to create the compensation foundation for improper verdicts which oversaw compensation to white terror victims and families president ma ying-jeou made an official apology in 2008 expressing hope that there will never be a tragedy similar to white terrorinitially the united states abandoned the kmt and expected that taiwan would fall to the communists however in 1950 the conflict between north korea and south korea which had been ongoing since the japanese withdrawal in 1945 escalated into full-blown war and in the context of the cold war us president harry s truman intervened again and dispatched the us navys 7th fleet into the taiwan strait to prevent hostilities between taiwan and mainland china in the treaty of san francisco and the treaty of taipei which came into force respectively on 28 april 1952 and 5 august 1952 japan formally renounced all right claim and title to taiwan and penghu and renounced all treaties signed with china before 1942 neither treaty specified to whom sovereignty over the islands should be transferred because the united states and the united kingdom disagreed on whether the roc or the prc was the legitimate government of china continuing conflict of the chinese civil war through the 1950s and intervention by the united states notably resulted in legislation such as the sino-american mutual defense treaty and the formosa resolution of 1955

as the chinese civil war continued without truce the government built up military fortifications throughout taiwan within this effort kmt veterans built the now famous central cross-island highway through the taroko gorge in the 1950s the two sides would continue to engage in sporadic military clashes with seldom publicized details well into the 1960s on the china coastal islands with an unknown number of night raids during the second taiwan strait crisis in september 1958 taiwans landscape saw nike-hercules missile batteries added with the formation of the 1st missile battalion chinese army that would not be deactivated until 1997 newer generations of missile batteries have since replaced the nike hercules systems throughout the island
during the 1960s and 1970s the roc maintained an authoritarian single-party government while its economy became industrialized and technology oriented this rapid economic growth known as the taiwan miracle was the result of a fiscal regime independent from mainland china and backed up among others by the support of us funds and demand for taiwanese products in the 1970s taiwan was economically the second fastest growing state in asia after japan taiwan along with hong kong south korea and singapore became known as one of the four asian tigers because of the cold war most western nations and the united nations regarded the roc as the sole legitimate government of china until the 1970s later especially after the termination of the sino-american mutual defense treaty most nations switched diplomatic recognition to the prc see united nations general assembly resolution 2758
up until the 1970s the government was regarded by western critics as undemocratic for upholding martial law for severely repressing any political opposition and for controlling media the kmt did not allow the creation of new parties and those that existed did not seriously compete with the kmt thus competitive democratic elections did not exist from the late 1970s to the 1990s however taiwan went through reforms and social changes that transformed it from an authoritarian state to a democracy in 1979 a pro-democracy protest known as the kaohsiung incident took place in kaohsiung to celebrate human rights day although the protest was rapidly crushed by the authorities it is today considered as the main event that united taiwans opposition


 democratic reforms 

chiang ching-kuo chiang kai-sheks son and successor as the president began reforms to the political system in the mid-1980s in 1984 the younger chiang selected lee teng-hui a taiwanese-born us-educated technocrat to be his vice-president in 1986 the democratic progressive party dpp was formed and inaugurated as the first opposition party in the roc to counter the kmt a year later chiang ching-kuo lifted martial law on the main island of taiwan martial law was lifted on penghu in 1979 matsu island in 1992 and kinmen island in 1993 with the advent of democratization the issue of the political status of taiwan gradually resurfaced as a controversial issue where previously the discussion of anything other than unification under the roc was taboo
after the death of chiang ching-kuo in january 1988 lee teng-hui succeeded him and became the first taiwan-born president lee continued the democratic reforms to the government and decrease the concentration of government authority in the hands of mainland chinese under lee taiwan underwent a process of localization in which taiwanese culture and history were promoted over a pan-china viewpoint in contrast to earlier kmt policies which had promoted a chinese identity lees reforms included printing banknotes from the central bank rather than the provincial bank of taiwan and streamlining the taiwan provincial government with most of its functions transferred to the executive yuan under lee the original members of the legislative yuan and national assembly a former supreme legislative body defunct in 2005 elected in 1947 to represent mainland chinese constituencies and having held the seats without re-election for more than four decades were forced to resign in 1991 the previously nominal representation in the legislative yuan was brought to an end reflecting the reality that the roc had no jurisdiction over mainland china and vice versa restrictions on the use of taiwanese hokkien in the broadcast media and in schools were also lifted

democratic reforms continued in the 1990s with lee teng-hui re-elected in 1996 in the first direct presidential election in the history of the roc during the later years of lees administration he was involved in corruption controversies relating to government release of land and weapons purchase although no legal proceedings commenced in 1997to meet the requisites of the nation prior to national unification the additional articles of the constitution of the republic of china was passed and then the former constitution of five powers turns to be more tripartite in 2000 chen shui-bian of the democratic progressive party was elected as the first non-kuomintang kmt president and was re-elected to serve his second and last term since 2004 polarized politics has emerged in taiwan with the formation of the pan-blue coalition of parties led by the kmt favouring eventual chinese reunification and the pan-green coalition of parties led by the dpp favouring an eventual and official declaration of taiwanese independence in early 2006 president chen shui-bian remarked
the national unification council will cease to function no budget will be ear-marked for it and its personnel must return to their original poststhe national unification guidelines will cease to apply

on 30 september 2007 the ruling dpp approved a resolution asserting a separate identity from china and called for the enactment of a new constitution for a normal country it also called for general use of taiwan as the countrys name without abolishing its formal name the republic of china the chen administration also pushed for referendums on national defense in 2004 and un entry in 2008 both of which held on the same day as the presidential election they both failed due to voter turnout below the required legal threshold of 50% of all registered voters the chen administration was dogged by public concerns over reduced economic growth legislative gridlock due to a pan-blue opposition-controlled legislative yuan and corruption involving the first family as well as government officialsthe kmt increased its majority in the legislative yuan in the january 2008 legislative elections while its nominee ma ying-jeou went on to win the presidency in march of the same year campaigning on a platform of increased economic growth and better ties with the prc under a policy of mutual nondenial ma took office on 20 may 2008 the same day that president chen shui-bian stepped down and was notified by prosecutors of possible corruption charges part of the rationale for campaigning for closer economic ties with the prc stems from the strong economic growth china attained since joining the world trade organization however some analysts say that despite the election of ma ying-jeou the diplomatic and military tensions with the prc have not been reducedin 2016 tsai ing-wen of the democratic progressive party dpp became president of taiwan   president tsai called upon the international community to help taiwan to preserve its democracy despite the threatening language used against taiwan by xi jinping general secretary of the communist party of china prc paramount leader  president tsai called upon the prc to democratize respect human rights and renounce the use of military force against taiwanon 24 may 2017 the constitutional court ruled that current marriage laws have been violating the constitution by denying taiwanese same-sex couples the right to marry the court ruled that if the legislative yuan does not pass adequate amendments to taiwanese marriage laws within two years same-sex marriages will automatically become legitimate in taiwan more than a year later however during the 2018 taiwanese referendum many voters expressed their disapproval of same-sex marriage turning down multiple proposals that were meant to enforce its legalization while favoring questions that opposed it


 geography 

the total area of the current jurisdiction of the republic of china is 36,193 km2 13,974 sq mi making it the worlds 137th-largest countrydependency smaller than switzerland and larger than belgium
the island of taiwan has an area of 35,883 km2 13,855 sq mi and lies some 180 kilometres 110 mi from the southeastern coast of mainland china across the taiwan strait the east china sea lies to the north the philippine sea to the east the bashi channel of the luzon strait directly to the south and the south china sea to the southwest
its shape is similar to a sweet potato giving rise to the slang term hanji sweet potato in hokkien used by taiwanese hokkien speakers to refer to people of native taiwanese descentthere is a contrast between the eastern two-thirds of the island consisting mostly of rugged mountains running in five ranges from the northern to the southern tip of the island and the flat to gently rolling chiayi–tainan plains in the west that are also home to most of taiwans population taiwans highest point is yu shan jade mountain at 3,952 metres 12,966 ft making taiwan the worlds fourth-highest island
the penghu islands 50 km 31.1 mi west of the main island have an area of 126.9 km2 49.0 sq mi more distant islands of the republic of china are the kinmen wuchiu and matsu islands off the coast of fujian with a total area of 180.5 km2 69.7 sq mi and the pratas islands and taiping island in the south china sea with a total area of 2.9 km2 1.1 sq mi and no permanent inhabitants
the roc government also claims the senkaku islands to the northeast which are controlled by japan


 climate 
taiwan lies on the tropic of cancer and its general climate is marine tropical the northern and central regions are subtropical whereas the south is tropical and the mountainous regions are temperate the average rainfall is 2,600 millimetres 100 inches per year for the island proper the rainy season is concurrent with the onset of the summer east asian monsoon in may and june the entire island experiences hot humid weather from june through september typhoons are most common in july august and september during the winter november to march the northeast experiences steady rain while the central and southern parts of the island are mostly sunny


 geology 

the island of taiwan lies in a complex tectonic area between the yangtze plate to the west and north the okinawa plate on the north-east and the philippine mobile belt on the east and south the upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of terranes mostly old island arcs which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the eurasian plate and the philippine sea plate these have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the eurasian plate as it was subducted beneath remnants of the philippine sea plate a process which left the crust under taiwan more buoyantthe east and south of taiwan are a complex system of belts formed by and part of the zone of active collision between the north luzon trough portion of the luzon volcanic arc and south china where accreted portions of the luzon arc and luzon forearc form the eastern coastal range and parallel inland longitudinal valley of taiwan respectivelythe major seismic faults in taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various terranes these have produced major quakes throughout the history of the island on 21 september 1999 a 7.3 quake known as the 921 earthquake killed more than 2,400 people the seismic hazard map for taiwan by the usgs shows 9/10 of the island as the highest rating most hazardous


 political and legal status 

the political and legal statuses of taiwan are contentious issues the peoples republic of china prc claims that the republic of china government is illegitimate referring to it as the taiwan authority the roc has its own constitution independently elected president and armed forces it has not formally renounced its claim to the mainland but roc government publications have increasingly downplayed itinternationally there is controversy on whether the roc still exists as a state or a defunct state per international law due to the lack of wide diplomatic recognition in a poll of taiwanese aged 20 and older taken by tvbs in march 2009 a majority of 64% opted for the status quo while 19% favoured independence and 5% favoured unification


 relations with the prc 

the political environment is complicated by the potential for military conflict should taiwan declare de jure independence it is the official prc policy to use force to ensure unification if peaceful unification is no longer possible as stated in its anti-secession law and for this reason there are substantial military installations on the fujian coaston 29 april 2005 kuomintang chairman lien chan travelled to beijing and met with communist party of china cpc general secretary hu jintao the first meeting between the leaders of the two parties since the end of the chinese civil war in 1949 on 11 february 2014 mainland affairs council head wang yu-chi travelled to nanjing and met with taiwan affairs office head zhang zhijun the first meeting between high-ranking officials from either side zhang paid a reciprocal visit to taiwan and met wang on 25 june 2014 making zhang the first minister-level prc official to ever visit taiwan on 7 november 2015 ma ying-jeou in his capacity as leader of taiwan and xi jinping in his capacity as leader of mainland china travelled to singapore and met up marking the highest-level exchange between the two sides since 1949
the prc supports a version of the one-china policy which states that taiwan and mainland china are both part of china and that the prc is the only legitimate government of china it uses this policy to prevent the international recognition of the roc as an independent sovereign state meaning that taiwan participates in international forums under the name chinese taipei with the emergence of the taiwanese independence movement the name taiwan has been employed increasingly often on the island


 foreign relations 

before 1928 the foreign policy of republican china was complicated by a lack of internal unity—competing centres of power all claimed legitimacy this situation changed after the defeat of the peiyang government by the kuomintang which led to widespread diplomatic recognition of the republic of chinaafter the kmts retreat to taiwan most countries notably the countries in the western bloc continued to maintain relations with the roc due to diplomatic pressure recognition gradually eroded and many countries switched recognition to the prc in the 1970s un resolution 2758 25 october 1971 recognized the peoples republic of china as chinas sole representative in the united nationsthe prc refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation that recognizes the roc and requires all nations with which it has diplomatic relations to make a statement recognizing its claims to taiwan as a result only 16 un member states and the holy see maintain official diplomatic relations with the republic of china the roc maintains unofficial relations with most countries via de facto embassies and consulates called taipei economic and cultural representative offices tecro with branch offices called taipei economic and cultural offices teco both tecro and teco are unofficial commercial entities of the roc in charge of maintaining diplomatic relations providing consular services ie visa applications and serving the national interests of the roc in other countriesthe united states remains one of the main allies of the country and through the taiwan relations act passed in 1979 has continued selling arms and providing military training to the armed forces this situation continues to be an issue for the peoples republic of china which considers us involvement disruptive to the stability of the region in january 2010 the obama administration announced its intention to sell 6.4 billion worth of military hardware to taiwan as a consequence the prc threatened the us with economic sanctions and warned that their co-operation on international and regional issues could sufferthe official position of the united states is that the prc is expected to use no force or threaten to use force against taiwan and the roc is to exercise prudence in managing all aspects of cross-strait relations both are to refrain from performing actions or espousing statements that would unilaterally alter taiwans statuson 16 december 2015 the obama administration announced a deal to sell 1.83 billion worth of arms to the armed forces of the roc chinas foreign ministry had expressed its disapproval for the sales and issued the us a stern warning saying it would hurt china–us relations


 participation in international events and organizations 

the roc was a founding member of the united nations and held the seat of china on the security council and other un bodies until 1971 when it was expelled by resolution 2758 and replaced in all un organs with the prc each year since 1992 the roc has petitioned the un for entry but its applications have not made it past committee

due to its limited international recognition the republic of china is a member of the unrepresented nations and peoples organization represented by a government-funded organization the taiwan foundation for democracy tfd under the name taiwanalso due to its one china policy the prc only participates in international organizations where the roc does not participate as a sovereign country most member states including the united states do not wish to discuss the issue of the rocs political status for fear of souring diplomatic ties with the prc however both the us and japan publicly support the rocs bid for membership in the world health organization as an observer however though the roc sought to participate in the who since 1997 their efforts were blocked by the prc until 2010 when they were invited as observers to attend the world health assembly under the name chinese taipeidue to prc pressure the roc is forced to use the name chinese taipei in international events such as the olympic games where the prc is also a party the roc is typically barred from using its national anthem and national flag in international events due to prc pressure roc spectators attending events such as the olympics are often barred from bringing roc flags into venues
taiwan also participates in the asia-pacific economic cooperation forum since 1991 and the world trade organization since 2002 under the name chinese taipei
the roc is able to participate as china in organizations that the prc does not participate in such as the world organization of the scout movement


 domestic opinion 

within taiwan opinions are polarized between those supporting unification represented by the pan-blue coalition of parties and those supporting independence represented by the pan-green coalition
the kmt the largest pan-blue party supports the status quo for the indefinite future with a stated ultimate goal of unification however it does not support unification in the short term with the prc as such a prospect would be unacceptable to most of its members and the public ma ying-jeou chairman of the kmt and former president of the roc has set out democracy economic development to a level near that of taiwan and equitable wealth distribution as the conditions that the prc must fulfill for reunification to occurthe democratic progressive party the largest pan-green party officially seeks independence but in practice also supports the status quo because its members and the public would not accept the risk of provoking the prcon 2 september 2008 mexican newspaper el sol de méxico asked president ma about his views on the subject of two chinas and if there was a solution for the sovereignty issues between the two the president replied that the relations are neither between two chinas nor two states it is a special relationship further he stated that the sovereignty issues between the two cannot be resolved at present but he quoted the 1992 consensus currently accepted by both the kuomintang and the communist party of china as a temporary measure until a solution becomes availableon 27 september 2017 taiwanese premier william lai said that he was a political worker who advocates taiwan independence but that as taiwan was an independent country called the republic of china it had no need to declare independence
the relationship with the prc and the related issues of taiwanese independence and chinese unification continue to dominate politics


 government and politics 

the government of the republic of china was founded on the constitution of the roc and its three principles of the people which states that the roc shall be a democratic republic of the people to be governed by the people and for the people the government is divided into five branches yuan the executive yuan cabinet the legislative yuan congress or parliament the judicial yuan the control yuan audit agency and the examination yuan civil service examination agency the constitution was drafted before the fall of mainland china to the communist party of china it was created by the kmt for the purpose of all of its claimed territory including taiwan even though the communist party boycotted the drafting of the constitution the constitution went into effect on 25 december 1947 the roc remained under martial law from 1948 until 1987 and much of the constitution was not in effect political reforms beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through the early 1990s liberalized the country and transformed into a multiparty democracy since the lifting of martial law the republic of china has democratized and reformed suspending constitutional components that were originally meant for the whole of china this process of amendment continues in 2000 the democratic progressive party dpp won the presidency ending kmts continuous control of the government in may 2005 a new national assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms these reforms have been passed the national assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot

the head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces is the president who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president the president has authority over the yuan the president appoints the members of the executive yuan as his cabinet including a premier who is officially the president of the executive yuan members are responsible for policy and administrationthe main legislative body is the unicameral legislative yuan with 113 seats seventy-three are elected by popular vote from single-member constituencies thirty-four are elected based on the proportion of nationwide votes received by participating political parties in a separate party list ballot and six are elected from two three-member aboriginal constituencies members serve four-year terms originally the unicameral national assembly as a standing constitutional convention and electoral college held some parliamentary functions but the national assembly was abolished in 2005 with the power of constitutional amendments handed over to the legislative yuan and all eligible voters of the republic via referendumsthe premier is selected by the president without the need for approval from the legislature but the legislature can pass laws without regard for the president as neither he nor the premier wields veto power thus there is little incentive for the president and the legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing parties after the election of the pan-greens chen shui-bian as president in 2000 legislation repeatedly stalled because of deadlock with the legislative yuan which was controlled by a pan-blue majority historically the roc has been dominated by strongman single party politics this legacy has resulted in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the president rather than the premier even though the constitution does not explicitly state the extent of the presidents executive powerthe judicial yuan is the highest judicial organ it interprets the constitution and other laws and decrees judges administrative suits and disciplines public functionaries the president and vice-president of the judicial yuan and additional thirteen justices form the council of grand justices they are nominated and appointed by the president with the consent of the legislative yuan the highest court the supreme court consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions each of which is formed by a presiding judge and four associate judges all appointed for life in 1993 a separate constitutional court was established to resolve constitutional disputes regulate the activities of political parties and accelerate the democratization process there is no trial by jury but the right to a fair public trial is protected by law and respected in practice many cases are presided over by multiple judges

capital punishment is still used in taiwan although efforts have been made by the government to reduce the number of executions nevertheless according to a survey in 2006 about 80% of taiwanese still wanted to keep the death penaltythe control yuan is a watchdog agency that monitors controls the actions of the executive it can be considered a standing commission for administrative inquiry and can be compared to the court of auditors of the european union or the government accountability office of the united statesthe examination yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of civil servants it is based on the old imperial examination system used in dynastic china it can be compared to the european personnel selection office of the european union or the office of personnel management of the united states


 major camps 

the tension between china and taiwan colours most of the political life and any government move towards taiwan independence is met by threat of military attack from the prc the prcs official policy is to reunify taiwan and mainland china under the formula of one country two systems and refuses to renounce the use of military force especially should taiwan seek a declaration of independencethe political scene is generally divided into two major camps in terms of views on how taiwan should relate to china or the prc referred to as cross-strait relations it is the main political difference between two camps the pan-blue coalition composed of the pro-unification kuomintang people first party pfp and new party who believe that the roc is the sole legitimate government of china including taiwan and supports eventual chinese reunification the opposition pan-green coalition is composed of the pro-independence dpp and taiwan solidarity union tsu it regards taiwan as an independent sovereign state synonymous with the roc opposes the definition that taiwan is part of china and seeks wide diplomatic recognition and an eventual declaration of formal taiwan independence the pan-green camp tends to favour emphasizing the republic of china as being a distinct country from the peoples republic of china thus in september 2007 the then ruling democratic progressive party approved a resolution asserting separate identity from china and called for the enactment of a new constitution for a normal country it called also for general use of taiwan as the countrys name without abolishing its formal name the republic of china some members of the coalition such as former president chen shui-bian argue that it is unnecessary to proclaim independence because taiwan is already an independent sovereign country and the republic of china is the same as taiwan despite being a member of kmt prior to and during his presidency lee teng-hui also held a similar view and was a supporter of the taiwanization movementpan-blue members generally support the concept of the one-china policy which states that there is only one china and that its only government is the roc they favour eventual re-unification of china the more mainstream pan-blue position is to lift investment restrictions and pursue negotiations with the prc to immediately open direct transportation links regarding independence the mainstream pan-blue position is to maintain the status quo while refusing immediate reunification president ma ying-jeou stated that there will be no unification nor declaration of independence during his presidency as of  2009 pan-blue members usually seek to improve relationships with mainland china with a current focus on improving economic ties


 current political issues 

the dominant political issue in taiwan is its relationship with the prc for almost 60 years there were no direct transportation links including direct flights between taiwan and mainland china this was a problem for many taiwanese businesses that had opened factories or branches in mainland china the former dpp administration feared that such links would lead to tighter economic and political integration with mainland china and in the 2006 lunar new year speech president chen shui-bian called for managed opening of links direct weekend charter flights between taiwan and mainland china began in july 2008 under the current kmt government and the first direct daily charter flights took off in december 2008other major political issues include the passage of an arms procurement bill that the united states authorized in 2001 in 2008 however the united states was reluctant to send over more arms to taiwan out of fear that it would hinder the recent improvement of ties between the prc and the roc another major political issue is the establishment of a national communications commission to take over from the government information office whose advertising budget exercised great control over the mediathe politicians and their parties have themselves become major political issues corruption among some dpp administration officials has been exposed in early 2006 president chen shui-bian was linked to possible corruption the political effect on president chen shui-bian was great causing a divide in the dpp leadership and supporters alike it eventually led to the creation of a political camp led by ex-dpp leader shih ming-teh which believes the president should resign the kmt assets continue to be another major issue as it was once the richest political party in the world nearing the end of 2006 kmts chairman ma ying-jeou was also hit by corruption controversies although he has since then been cleared of any wrongdoings by the courts after completing his second term as president chen shui-bian was charged with corruption and money laundering following his conviction he is serving a 17-year sentence in taipei prisontaiwans leaders including president tsai and premier william lai have repeatedly accused china of spreading fake news via social media to create divisions in taiwanese society influence voters and support candidates more sympathetic to beijing ahead of the 2018 taiwanese local elections


 national identity 

roughly 84% of taiwans population descends from han chinese who migrated from qing china between 1661 and 1895 another significant fraction descends from han chinese who immigrated from mainland china in the late 1940s and early 1950s the shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences as well as hostility between the rival roc and prc have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones since democratization and the lifting of martial law a distinct taiwanese identity as opposed to taiwanese identity as a subset of a chinese identity is often at the heart of political debates its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland china and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for de jure taiwan independence the pan-green camp supports a distinct taiwanese identity while the pan-blue camp supports a chinese identity only the kmt has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a taiwanese identity as part of a chinese identityaccording to a survey conducted in march 2009 49% of the respondents consider themselves as taiwanese only and 44% of the respondents consider themselves as taiwanese and chinese 3% consider themselves as only chinese another survey conducted in taiwan in july 2009 showed that 82.8% of respondents consider the roc and the prc as two separate countries with each developing on its own a survey conducted in december 2009 showed that 62% of the respondents consider themselves as taiwanese only and 22% of the respondents consider themselves as both taiwanese and chinese 8% consider themselves as only chinese the survey also shows that among 18- to 29-year-old respondents 75% consider themselves as taiwanese onlyin the latest survey conducted by national chengchi university in 2014 and published in early 2015 60.6% of respondents identified themselves exclusively as taiwanese 32.5% identified themselves as both taiwanese and chinese and 3.5% identified themselves as chinese


 military 

the republic of china army takes its roots in the national revolutionary army which was established by sun yat-sen in 1925 in guangdong with a goal of reunifying china under the kuomintang when the peoples liberation army won the chinese civil war much of the national revolutionary army retreated to taiwan along with the government it was later reformed into the republic of china army units which surrendered and remained in mainland china were either disbanded or incorporated into the peoples liberation army
today taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military mainly as defence against the constant threat of invasion by the peoples liberation army under the anti-secession law of the peoples republic of china this law gives green light to the use of military force when certain chinese red lines formulated in the anti-secession law are crossed like endangering citizens of the peoples republic of china from 1949 to the 1970s the primary mission of the military was to retake mainland china through project national glory as this mission has shifted to defence because the strength of peoples republic of china has massively increased the roc military has begun to shift emphasis from the traditionally dominant army to the air force and navy

control of the armed forces has also passed into the hands of the civilian government as the roc military shares historical roots with the kmt the older generation of high-ranking officers tends to have pan-blue sympathies however many have retired and there are many more non-mainlanders enlisting in the armed forces in the younger generations so the political leanings of the military have moved closer to the public norm in taiwanthe roc began a force reduction program jingshi an translated to streamlining program to scale down its military from a level of 450,000 in 1997 to 380,000 in 2001 as of  2009 the armed forces of the roc number approximately 300,000 with nominal reserves totalling 3.6 million as of  2015 conscription remains universal for qualified males reaching age eighteen but as a part of the reduction effort many are given the opportunity to fulfill their draft requirement through alternative service and are redirected to government agencies or defence related industries current plans call for a transition to a predominantly professional army over the next decade conscription periods are planned to decrease from 14 months to 12 in the last months of the bush administration taipei took the decision to reverse the trend of declining defence spending at a time when most asian countries kept on reducing their military expenditures it also decided to strengthen both defensive and offensive capabilities taipei still keeps a large military apparatus relative to the islands population defence expenditures for 2008 were ntd 334 billion approximately us 10.5 billion which accounted for 2.94% of gdp

the armed forces primary concern at this time according to the national defense report is the possibility of an invasion by the prc consisting of a naval blockade airborne assault andor missile bombardment four upgraded kidd-class destroyers were purchased from the united states and commissioned into the republic of china navy in 2005–2006 significantly upgrading taiwans air defence and submarine hunting abilities the ministry of national defense planned to purchase diesel-powered submarines and patriot anti-missile batteries from the united states but its budget has been stalled repeatedly by the opposition-pan-blue coalition controlled legislature the defence package was stalled from 2001 to 2007 where it was finally passed through the legislature and the us responded on 3 october 2008 with a 6.5 billion arms package including pac iii anti-air defence systems ah-64d apache attack helicopters and other arms and parts a significant amount of military hardware has been bought from the united states and as of  2009 continues to be legally guaranteed by the taiwan relations act in the past france and the netherlands have also sold military weapons and hardware to the roc but they almost entirely stopped in the 1990s under pressure of the prc

the first line of defence against invasion by the prc is the rocs own armed forces current roc military doctrine is to hold out against an invasion or blockade until the us military responds there is however no guarantee in the taiwan relations act or any other treaty that the united states will defend taiwan even in the event of invasion the joint declaration on security between the us and japan signed in 1996 may imply that japan would be involved in any response however japan has refused to stipulate whether the area surrounding japan mentioned in the pact includes taiwan and the precise purpose of the pact is unclear the australia new zealand united states security treaty anzus treaty may mean that other us allies such as australia could theoretically be involved in practice the risk of losing economic ties with china may prevent australia from taking action


 administrative divisions 

according to the 1947 constitution the territory of the roc is according to its existing national boundaries according to the executive yuan in 2012 mongolia was re-recognized by republic of china as an independent country when the constitution was announced in 1946when the roc retreated to taiwan in 1949 its claimed territory consisted of 35 provinces 12 special municipalities 1 special administrative region and 2 autonomous regions however since its retreat the roc has controlled only taiwan province and some islands of fujian province the roc also controls the pratas islands and taiping island in the spratly islands which are part of the disputed south china sea islands they were placed under kaohsiung administration after the retreat to taiwansince 1949 the government has made some changes in the area under its control taipei became a special municipality in 1967 and kaohsiung in 1979 the two provincial governments were streamlined with their functions transferred to the central government fujian in 1956 and taiwan in 1998 in 2010 new taipei taichung and tainan were upgraded to special municipalities and in 2014 taoyuan county was also upgraded to taoyuan special municipality this brought the top-level divisions to their current state
according to article 4 of the local government act laws pertaining to special municipalities also apply to counties with a population exceeding 2 million  this provision does not currently apply to any county although it previously applied to taipei county now new taipei city and taoyuan county now taoyuan city


 economy 

the quick industrialization and rapid growth of taiwan during the latter half of the 20th century has been called the taiwan miracle taiwan is one of the four asian tigers alongside hong kong south korea and singapore
japanese rule prior to and during world war ii brought changes in the public and private sectors most notably in the area of public works which enabled rapid communications and facilitated transport throughout much of the island the japanese also improved public education and made it compulsory for all residents of taiwan
by 1945 hyperinflation was in progress in mainland china and taiwan as a result of the war with japan to isolate taiwan from it the nationalist government created a new currency area for the island and began a price stabilization program these efforts significantly slowed inflation
when the kmt government fled to taiwan it brought millions of taels where 1 tael  37.5 g or 1.2 ozt of gold and the foreign currency reserve of mainland china which according to the kmt stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation perhaps more importantly as part of its retreat to taiwan the kmt brought the intellectual and business elites from mainland china the kmt government instituted many laws and land reforms that it had never effectively enacted on mainland china the government also implemented a policy of import-substitution attempting to produce imported goods domestically
in 1950 with the outbreak of the korean war the united states began an aid program which resulted in fully stabilized prices by 1952 economic development was encouraged by american economic aid and programs such as the joint commission on rural reconstruction which turned the agricultural sector into the basis for later growth under the combined stimulus of the land reform and the agricultural development programs agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of 4 per cent from 1952 to 1959 which was greater than the population growth 3.6in 1962 taiwan had a nominal per-capita gross national product gnp of 170 placing its economy on a par with those of the democratic republic of the congo on a purchasing power parity ppp basis its gdp per capita in the early 1960s was 1,353 in 1990 prices by 2011 per-capita gnp adjusted for purchasing power parity ppp had risen to 37,000 contributing to a human development index hdi equivalent to that of other developed countries taiwans hdi in 2012 is 0.890 23rd very high according to the uns new inequality-adjusted hdi calculation method
in 1974 chiang ching-kuo implemented the ten major construction projects the beginning foundations that helped taiwan transform into its current export driven economy since the 1990s a number of taiwan-based technology firms have expanded their reach around the world well-known international technology companies headquartered in taiwan include personal computer manufacturers acer inc and asus mobile phone maker htc as well as electronics manufacturing giant foxconn which makes products for apple amazon and microsoft computex taipei is a major computer expo held since 1981
today taiwan has a dynamic capitalist export-driven economy with gradually decreasing state involvement in investment and foreign trade in keeping with this trend some large government-owned banks and industrial firms are being privatized real growth in gdp has averaged about 8% during the past three decades exports have provided the primary impetus for industrialization the trade surplus is substantial and foreign reserves are the worlds fifth largest the currency of taiwan is the new taiwan dollar
since the beginning of the 1990s the economic ties between taiwan and the peoples republic of china have been very prolific as of  2008 more than us150 billion have been invested in the prc by taiwanese companies and about 10% of the taiwanese labour force works in the prc often to run their own businesses although the economy of taiwan benefits from this situation some have expressed the view that the island has become increasingly dependent on the mainland chinese economy a 2008 white paper by the department of industrial technology states that taiwan should seek to maintain stable relation with china while continuing to protect national security and avoiding excessive sinicization of taiwanese economy others argue that close economic ties between taiwan and mainland china would make any military intervention by the pla against taiwan very costly and therefore less probabletaiwans total trade in 2010 reached an all-time high of us526.04 billion according to taiwans ministry of finance both exports and imports for the year reached record levels totalling us274.64 billion and us251.4 billion respectively

in 2001 agriculture constituted only 2% of gdp down from 35% in 1952 traditional labour-intensive industries are steadily being moved offshore and with more capital and technology-intensive industries replacing them high-technology industrial parks have sprung up in every region in taiwan the roc has become a major foreign investor in the prc thailand indonesia the philippines malaysia and vietnam it is estimated that some 50,000 taiwanese businesses and 1,000,000 businesspeople and their dependents are established in the prcbecause of its conservative financial approach and its entrepreneurial strengths taiwan suffered little compared with many of its neighbours from the 1997 asian financial crisis unlike its neighbours south korea and japan the taiwanese economy is dominated by small and medium-sized businesses rather than the large business groups the global economic downturn however combined with poor policy co-ordination by the new administration and increasing bad debts in the banking system pushed taiwan into recession in 2001 the first whole year of negative growth since 1947 due to the relocation of many manufacturing and labour-intensive industries to the prc unemployment also reached a level not seen since the 1970s oil crisis this became a major issue in the 2004 presidential election growth averaged more than 4% in the 2002–2006 period and the unemployment rate fell below 4the roc often joins international organizations especially ones that also include the peoples republic of china under a politically neutral name the roc has been a member of governmental trade organizations such as the world trade organization under the name separate customs territory of taiwan penghu kinmen and matsu chinese taipei since 2002
