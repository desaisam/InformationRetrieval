12ppons–brooks is a periodic comet with an orbital period of 71 years it fits the classical definition of a halley-type comet with 20 years  period  200 years its next closest approach to earth is in 2024as of december 2015 12ppons–brooks has not been identified with any meteor-shower streams


 discovery 
a comet was observed from korea from 10 april to june 1313 ce over in china in the reign of jin tsung the 2nd year of the epoch hwang king 3rd moon day ting wei a comet appeared in the eastern part of s d tsing this date is calculated to 13 april 1313 the eastern part of the s d tsing corresponds to the stars mebsuta and alhena in gemini about right-ascension 6h and declination 20° in vietnam during the third month of the twenty-first year of the hung-long reign-period 28 march to 25 april 1313 a hui comet was seen in the west italian observers noticed a brilliant four-coloured apparition in the west with two horns like the moonkoreans observed another comet over 20 march - 22 may 1668 this one started from pisces ra 1h dec 30° and traveled southwest across western cetus toward eridanus ra 5h dec -10° again in vietnam on a ky-suu day of the first month in the spring of the sixth year of the canh-tri reign-period a mau-than year 8 march 1668 a celestial flail star appeared in the northwest direction measuring five feet and resembling a hui comet this is further noted in the astronomical chapters of the ching shi kao in china a comet was also recorded beginning early march 1668 by europeans this appeared in the whale constellation today known as cetus and likewise traveled to eridanusno historical cometary observation has yet been securely identified with pons-brooks for its next perihelion circa 1740 although some would later wonder about the 1742 comet in the west a third observation was logged on july 12 1812 by jean-louis pons independently this comet was later found by vincent wisniewski on august 1 and alexis bouvard on august 2 the same year at the time no-one had brought these observations together
in 1883 a faint fourth comet was accidentally discovered by william robert brooks and later identified as the same object as the 1812 shortly after its initial discovery it was found to have an orbital period of about 70 years with an error of about 5 years johann franz encke determined a definitive orbit with a period of 70.68 years this orbit was used to generate an ephemeris for the 1883-4 return but searches were unsuccessful until it was rediscovered by brooks this year it traveled from scheat and markab in western pegasus 13 january 1884 southward through pisces to reach perihelion below iota and beta ceti ra 0h dec -10° around 24 januarythat february daniel kirkwood tentatively identified pons-brooks with the comet of 1313 also with comet-sightings 1240 1382 1457 1529 and 1742 but could not link anything with the expected return 1670 in 2007 korean astronomers so-yeon park and jongchul chae confirmed pons-brooks with the observation of 1313 and added that of 1668


 orbit 
libration is locked at a 61 resonance with jupiter the tisserand invariant with respect to jupiter j is 0.60

with a steep orbital inclination of 74.2° this comet does not spend a lot of time near the ecliptic the jet propulsion laboratorys jpl website shows that between the years 1900 and 2200 that the comet was and will be most significantly perturbed by saturn on july 29 1957 at that point it passed within 1.6au of the giant planets influence even this approach had negligible effect the comets orbit appears to be stable between 1740 and 2167 with no strong perturbations by any of the planetskirkwood in 1884 noticed that pons-brooks shares elements with de vicos comet of 1846 he suggested that the latter had calved off pons-brooks some centuries prior later he identified the two comets capture into their elliptical orbits or their parent bodys capture with their shared aphelion close to neptune 991 ce


 speculations 


 bonillas comet 
on august 12-13th of 1883 mexican astronomer josé bonilla observed 447 bodies cross the solar disc from an observatory in zacatecas mexican astronomers in 2011 suggested that a comet may have split into several pieces these objects were estimated to have had a size of between 46 and 1022 meters and to have passed only 538 to 8062 km from the earth they raised pons-brooks as one possibility in which case earth barely avoided multiple tunguska events or even a mass extinction this was reported in the media october 2011but the source of these objects could also have been comet c1883 d1 brooks-swift or even a third unknown comet that year the event also coincided with the annual perseids meteor shower even migrating birds cannot be ruled out


 prehistorical times 
chinese historiography records its first comet around 1500 bce although long after the fact traditionally this broom-star heralded the sweeping-away of the tyrannical xia dynasty and its replacement with the shang
