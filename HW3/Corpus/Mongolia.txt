 history 


 prehistory and antiquity 

homo erectus inhabited mongolia from 850,000 years ago modern humans reached mongolia approximately 40,000 years ago during the upper paleolithic the khoit tsenkher cave in khovd province shows lively pink brown and red ochre paintings dated to 20,000 years ago of mammoths lynx bactrian camels and ostriches earning it the nickname the lascaux of mongolia the venus figurines of malta 21,000 years ago testify to the level of upper paleolithic art in northern mongolia malta is now part of russia

neolithic agricultural settlements c 5500–3500 bc such as those at norovlin tamsagbulag bayanzag and rashaan khad predated the introduction of horse-riding nomadism a pivotal event in the history of mongolia which became the dominant culture horse-riding nomadism has been documented by archeological evidence in mongolia during the copper and bronze age afanasevo culture 3500–2500 bc this culture was active to the khangai mountains in central mongolia the wheeled vehicles found in the burials of the afanasevans have been dated to before 2200 bc pastoral nomadism and metalworking became more developed with the later okunev culture 2nd millennium bc andronovo culture 2300–1000 bc and karasuk culture 1500–300 bc culminating with the iron age xiongnu empire in 209 bc monuments of the pre-xiongnu bronze age include deer stones keregsur kurgans square slab tombs and rock paintings
although cultivation of crops has continued since the neolithic agriculture has always remained small in scale compared to pastoral nomadism agriculture may have first been introduced from the west or arose independently in the region the population during the copper age has been described as mongoloid in the east of what is now mongolia and as europoid in the west tocharians yuezhi and scythians inhabited western mongolia during the bronze age the mummy of a scythian warrior which is believed to be about 2,500 years old was a 30- to 40-year-old man with blond hair it  was found in the altai mongolia as equine nomadism was introduced into mongolia the political center of the eurasian steppe also shifted to mongolia where it remained until the 18th century ce the intrusions of northern pastoralists eg the guifang shanrong and donghu into china during the shang dynasty 1600–1046 bc and zhou dynasty 1046–256 bc presaged the age of nomadic empires
the concept of mongolia as an independent power north of china is expressed in a letter sent by emperor wen of han to laoshang chanyu in 162 bc recorded in the hanshu

since prehistoric times mongolia has been inhabited by nomads who from time to time formed great confederations that rose to power and prominence common institutions were the office of the khan the kurultai supreme council left and right wings imperial army keshig and the decimal military system the first of these empires the xiongnu of undetermined ethnicity were brought together by modu shanyu to form a confederation in 209 bc soon they emerged as the greatest threat to the qin dynasty forcing the latter to construct the great wall of china it was guarded by up to almost 300,000 soldiers during marshal meng tians tenure as a means of defense against the destructive xiongnu raids the vast xiongnu empire 209 bc–93 ad was followed by the mongolic xianbei empire 93–234 ad which also ruled more than the entirety of present-day mongolia the mongolic rouran khaganate 330–555 of xianbei provenance was the first to use khagan as an imperial title it ruled a massive empire before being defeated by the göktürks 555–745 whose empire was even bigger
the göktürks laid siege to panticapaeum present-day kerch in 576 they were succeeded by the uyghur khaganate 745–840 who were defeated by the kyrgyz the mongolic khitans descendants of the xianbei ruled mongolia during the liao dynasty 907–1125 after which the khamag mongol 1125–1206 rose to prominence

 middle ages to early 20th century 

in the chaos of the late 12th century a chieftain named temüjin finally succeeded in uniting the mongol tribes between manchuria and the altai mountains in 1206 he took the title genghis khan and waged a series of military campaigns – renowned for their brutality and ferocity – sweeping through much of asia and forming the mongol empire the largest contiguous land empire in world history under his successors it stretched from present-day poland in the west to korea in the east and from siberia in the north to the gulf of oman and vietnam in the south covering some 33,000,000 square kilometres 13,000,000 sq mi 22% of earths total land area and had a population of over 100 million people about a quarter of earths total population at the time the emergence of pax mongolica also significantly eased trade and commerce across asia during its heightafter genghis khans death the empire was subdivided into four kingdoms or khanates these eventually became quasi-independent after the toluid civil war 1260–1264 which broke out in a battle for power following möngke khans death in 1259 one of the khanates the great khaanate consisting of the mongol homeland and china became known as the yuan dynasty under kublai khan the grandson of genghis khan he set up his capital in present-day beijing after more than a century of power the yuan was replaced by the ming dynasty in 1368 and the mongol court fled to the north as the ming armies pursued the mongols into their homeland they successfully sacked and destroyed the mongol capital karakorum and other cities some of these attacks were repelled by the mongols under ayushridar and his general köke temür

after the expulsion of the yuan dynasty rulers from china the mongols continued to rule their homeland known as the northern yuan dynasty the next centuries were marked by violent power struggles among various factions notably the genghisids and the non-genghisid oirats as well as by several chinese invasions such as the five expeditions led by the yongle emperor in the early 15th century the oirads under esen tayisi gained the upper hand and raided china in 1449 in a conflict over esens right to pay tribute capturing the ming emperor in the process when esen was murdered in 1454 the borjigids regained powerin the early 16th century dayan khan and his khatun mandukhai reunited the entire mongol nation under the genghisids in the mid-16th century altan khan of the tümed a grandson of dayan khan – but not a hereditary or legitimate khan – became powerful he founded hohhot in 1557 after he met with the dalai lama in 1578 he ordered the introduction of tibetan buddhism to mongolia it was the second time this had occurred abtai khan of the khalkha converted to buddhism and founded the erdene zuu monastery in 1585 his grandson zanabazar became the first jebtsundamba khutughtu in 1640 following the leaders the entire mongolian population embraced buddhism each family kept scriptures and buddha statues on an altar at the north side of their ger yurt mongolian nobles donated land money and herders to the monasteries as was typical in states with established religions the top religious institutions the monasteries wielded significant temporal power in addition to spiritual power

the last mongol khan was ligden khan in the early 17th century he came into conflicts with the manchus over the looting of chinese cities and also alienated most mongol tribes he died in 1634 by 1636 most inner mongolian tribes had submitted to the manchus who founded the qing dynasty the khalkha eventually submitted to qing rule in 1691 thus bringing all of todays mongolia under manchu rule after several wars the dzungars the western mongols or oirats were virtually annihilated during the qing conquest of dzungaria in 1757–58some scholars estimate that about 80% of the 600,000 or more dzungar were destroyed by a combination of disease and warfare outer mongolia was given relative autonomy being administered by the hereditary genghisid khanates of tusheet khan setsen khan zasagt khan and sain noyon khan the jebtsundamba khutuktu of mongolia had immense de facto authority the manchu forbade mass chinese immigration into the area which allowed the mongols to keep their culture the oirats who migrated to the volga steppes in russia became known as kalmyks
the main trade route during this period was the tea road through siberia it had permanent stations located every 25 to 30 kilometres 16 to 19 mi each of which was staffed by 5–30 chosen families urga present-day ulaanbaatar benefited greatly from this overland trade as it was the only major settlement in outer mongolia used as a stopover point by merchants officials and travelers on the tea roaduntil 1911 the qing dynasty maintained control of mongolia with a series of alliances and intermarriages as well as military and economic measures ambans manchu high officials were installed in khüree uliastai and khovd and the country was divided into numerous feudal and ecclesiastical fiefdoms which also placed people in power with loyalty to the qing over the course of the 19th century the feudal lords attached more importance to representation and less importance to the responsibilities towards their subjects the behaviour of mongolias nobility together with usurious practices by chinese traders and the collection of imperial taxes in silver instead of animals resulted in widespread poverty among the nomads by 1911 there were 700 large and small monasteries in outer mongolia their 115,000 monks made up 21% of the population apart from the jebtsundamba khutuktu there were 13 other reincarnating high lamas called seal-holding saints tamgatai khutuktu in outer mongolia


 modern history 

with the fall of the qing dynasty in 1911 mongolia under the bogd khaan declared independence  but the newly established republic of china considered mongolia to be part of its own territory yuan shikai the president of the republic of china considered the new republic to be the successor of the qing  bogd khaan said that both mongolia and china had been administered by the manchu during the qing and after the fall of the qing dynasty in 1911 the contract of mongolian submission to the manchu had become invalidthe area controlled by the bogd khaan was approximately that of the former outer mongolia during the qing period in 1919 after the october revolution in russia chinese troops led by warlord xu shuzheng occupied mongolia warfare erupted on the northern border as a result of the russian civil war the white russian lieutenant general baron ungern led his troops into mongolia in october 1920 defeating the chinese forces in niislel khüree now ulaanbaatar in early february 1921 with mongol support
to eliminate the threat posed by ungern bolshevik russia decided to support the establishment of a communist mongolian government and army this mongolian army took the mongolian part of kyakhta from chinese forces on march 18 1921 and on july 6 russian and mongolian troops arrived in khüree mongolia declared its independence again on july 11 1921 as a result mongolia was closely aligned with the soviet union over the next seven decades


 mongolian peoples republic 
in 1924 after the bogd khaan died of laryngeal cancer or as some sources claim at the hands of russian spies the countrys political system was changed the mongolian peoples republic was established in 1928 khorloogiin choibalsan rose to power the early leaders of the mongolian peoples republic 1921–1952 were not communists and many of them were pan-mongolists the soviet union forcefully established a communist regime in mongolia by later exterminating pan-mongolists in the 1960s soviets recognized the mongolian peoples party as real communists who took power after the suspicious death of pan-mongolist leader choibalsan

khorloogiin choibalsan instituted collectivisation of livestock began the destruction of the buddhist monasteries and carried out the stalinist repressions in mongolia which resulted in the murders of numerous monks and other leaders in mongolia during the 1920s approximately one-third of the male population were monks by the beginning of the 20th century about 750 monasteries were functioning in mongoliain 1930 soviet union stopped buryat migration to the mongolian peoples republic to prevent mongolian reunification all leaders of mongolia who did not fulfill stalins demands to perform red terror against mongolians were executed including peljidiin genden and anandyn amar the stalinist purges in mongolia which began in 1937 killed more than 30,000 people choibalsan died suspiciously in the soviet union in 1952 comintern leader bohumír šmeral said people of mongolia are not important the land is important mongolian land is larger than england france and germany

after the japanese invasion of neighboring manchuria in 1931 mongolia was threatened on this front during the soviet-japanese border war of 1939 the soviet union successfully defended mongolia against japanese expansionism  mongolia fought against japan during the battles of khalkhin gol in 1939 and during the soviet–japanese war in august 1945 to liberate inner mongolia from japan and mengjiang


 cold war 
the february 1945 yalta conference provided for the soviet unions participation in the pacific war one of the soviet conditions for its participation put forward at yalta was that after the war outer mongolia would retain its independence  the referendum took place on october 20 1945 with according to official numbers 100% of the electorate voting for independenceafter the establishment of the peoples republic of china both countries confirmed their mutual recognition on october 6 1949 however the republic of china used its security council veto in 1955 to stop the admission of the mongolian peoples republic to the united nations on the grounds it recognized all of mongolia —including outer mongolia— as part of china this was the only time the republic of china ever used its veto hence and because of the repeated threats to veto by the roc mongolia did not join the un until 1961 when the soviet union agreed to lift its veto on the admission of mauritania and any other newly independent african state in return for the admission of mongolia faced with pressure from nearly all the other african countries the roc relented under protest mongolia and mauritania were both admitted to the un on 27 october 1961 see china and the united nations
on january 26 1952 yumjaagiin tsedenbal took power in mongolia after the death of choibalsan while tsedenbal was visiting moscow in august 1984 his severe illness prompted the parliament to announce his retirement and replace him with jambyn batmönkh


 post-cold war 
the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 strongly influenced mongolian politics and youth its people undertook the peaceful democratic revolution in 1990 and the introduction of a multi-party system and a market economy
a new constitution was introduced in 1992 and the peoples republic was dropped from the countrys name the transition to a decentralised economy was often rocky during the early 1990s the country had to deal with high inflation and food shortages the first election victories for non-communist parties came in 1993 presidential elections and 1996 parliamentary elections china has supported mongolias application for membership in to the asia cooperation dialogue acd asia-pacific economic cooperation apec and granting it observer status in the shanghai cooperation organization

 climate 

mongolia is known as the land of the eternal blue sky or country of blue sky mongolian mönkh khökh tengeriin oron because it has over 250 sunny days a year

most of the country is hot in the summer and extremely cold in the winter with january averages dropping as low as −30 °c −22 °f a vast front of cold heavy shallow air comes in from siberia in winter and collects in river valleys and low basins causing very cold temperatures while slopes of mountains are much warmer due to the effects of temperature inversion temperature increases with altitude

in winter the whole of mongolia comes under the influence of the siberian anticyclone the localities most severely affected by this cold weather are uvs province ulaangom western khovsgol rinchinlhumbe eastern zavkhan tosontsengel northern bulgan hutag and eastern dornod province khalkhiin gol ulaanbaatar is strongly but less severely affected the cold gets less severe as one goes south reaching the warmest january temperatures in omnogovi province dalanzadgad khanbogd and the region of the altai mountains bordering china a unique microclimate is the fertile grassland-forest region of central and eastern arkhangai province tsetserleg and northern ovorkhangai province arvaikheer where january temperatures are on average the same and often higher than the warmest desert regions to the south in addition to being more stable the khangai mountains play a certain role in forming this microclimate in tsetserleg the warmest town in this microclimate nighttime january temperatures rarely go under −30 °c −22 °f while daytime january temperatures often reach 0 °c 32 °f to 5 °c 41 °f the country is subject to occasional harsh climatic conditions known as zud zud which is a natural disaster unique to mongolia results in large proportions of the countrys livestock dying from starvation or freezing temperatures or both resulting in economic upheaval for the largely pastoral population the annual average temperature in ulaanbaatar is −1.3 °c 29.7 °f making it the worlds coldest capital city mongolia is high cold and windy it has an extreme continental climate with long cold winters and short summers during which most of its annual precipitation falls the country averages 257 cloudless days a year and it is usually at the center of a region of high atmospheric pressure precipitation is highest in the north average of 200 to 350 millimeters 8 to 14 in per year and lowest in the south which receives 100 to 200 millimeters 4 to 8 in annually the highest annual precipitation of 622.297 mm 24.500 in occurred in the forests of bulgan province close to the border with russia and the lowest of 41.735 mm 1.643 in occurred in the gobi desert period 1961–1990 the sparsely populated far north of bulgan province averages 600 mm 24 in in annual precipitation which means it receives more precipitation than beijing 571.8 mm or 22.51 in or berlin 571 mm or 22.5 in


 wildlife 

the name gobi is a mongol term for a desert steppe which usually refers to a category of arid rangeland with insufficient vegetation to support marmots but with enough to support camels mongols distinguish gobi from desert proper although the distinction is not always apparent to outsiders unfamiliar with the mongolian landscape

gobi rangelands are fragile and easily destroyed by overgrazing which results in expansion of the true desert a stony waste where not even bactrian camels can survive the arid conditions in the gobi are attributed to the rain shadow effect caused by the himalayas before the himalayas were formed by the collision of the indo-australian plate with the eurasian plate 10 million years ago mongolia was a flourishing habitat for major fauna but still somewhat arid and cold due to distance from sources of evaporation sea turtle and mollusk fossils have been found in the gobi apart from well-known dinosaur fossils tadpole shrimps lepidurus mongolicus are still found in the gobi today the eastern part of mongolia including the onon kherlen rivers and lake buir form part of the amur river basin draining to the pacific ocean it hosts some unique species like the eastern brook lamprey daurian crayfish cambaroides dauricus and daurian pearl oyster dahurinaia dahurica in the ononkherlen rivers as well as siberian prawn exopalaemon modestus in lake buir
