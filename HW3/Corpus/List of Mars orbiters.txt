the following table is a list of mars orbiters consisting of space probes which were launched from earth and are currently orbiting mars as of december 2016 there are up to fourteen known artificial satellites in mars orbit six of which are active


 history 


 20th century 

the soviets mars program and nasas mariner program became the two first successful space programs that intended to explore mars through orbiters mars 2 mars 3 and mariner 9 were all launched into space in may 1971 and all entered marsâ€™ orbit that same year nasas mariner 9 reached the planets orbit first on november 14 narrowly beating the soviets spacecraft amid the space race and subsequently became the first spacecraft to orbit another planetcontact with all eight mars orbiters launched during the 20th century has been lost nasas four spacecraft are conjectured to remain in mars orbit mariner 9 viking 1 and viking 2 are expected to lower down into the martian atmosphere by 2022 and either burn up or crash into the planets surface mars global surveyor is expected to crash onto the surface of the planet by 2047 the fate of the soviets three mars program orbiters and phobos 2 remains unclear but they are still presumed to be in orbitin 1999 the mars climate orbiter impacted the martian atmosphere


 21st century 

2001 mars odyssey was launched april 7 2001 on a delta ii rocket and currently holds the record for the longest-surviving continually active spacecraft in orbit around a planet other than earth at 17 years 4 months and 13 daysin 2003 the european space agency esa launched their first planetary mission with mars express to conduct reconnaissance and exploration of mars from orbit on 12 august 2005 nasa launched mars reconnaissance orbiter mro as mro entered orbit in 2006 it joined three other active spacecraft which were in mars orbit mars global surveyor mgs mars express and 2001 mars odyssey at the time this set a record for the most operational spacecraft in the immediate vicinity of mars mgs has since ceased to function
on september 24 2014 mangalyaan launched by the indian space research organisation reached mars orbit isro launched the orbiter on november 5 2013 as a technology demonstrator project its secondary goal is to analyze the martian atmosphere and topography the mission is the first successful asian interplanetary mission ten days after isros launch nasa launched their seventh mars orbiter maven to study the martian atmosphere its goals include determining how the planets atmosphere and water presumed to have once been substantial were lost over time


 fate 
after achieving orbit functional or not mars orbiters have been predicted to remain in orbit for a certain amount of time
viking 1 orbiter likely to be in orbit until 2019
mariner 9 is expected to remain in orbit until approximately 2022 when the spacecraft is projected to enter the martian atmosphere and either burn up or crash into the planets surface
mars global surveyor around 2046 199650 yearsbesides decaying to mars a collision with a moon or other spacecraft is also a possibility in march 2017 maven had to change its orbit to avoid colliding with phobos and with an increasing number of spacecraft at mars this risk increases the mars global surveyor is still being tracked although it is no longer functioning


 legend 


 table of objects 
note that days active category does not necessarily equate to time in orbit for example mars global surveyor is expected remain in mars orbit for 50 years after its arrival the detection of derelict spacecraft in mars orbit has some interest due to the minute risk of collision with such a spacecraft and an example of this is a  proposal to use the optical navigation camera on the mars reconnaissance orbiter to search for small moons dust rings and old orbiters
