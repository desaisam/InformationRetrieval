a minor planet is an astronomical object in direct orbit around the sun or more broadly any star with a planetary system that is neither a planet nor exclusively classified as a comet before 2006 the international astronomical union iau officially used the term minor planet but during that years meeting it reclassified minor planets and comets into dwarf planets and small solar system bodies sssbsminor planets can be dwarf planets asteroids trojans centaurs kuiper belt objects and other trans-neptunian objects as of 2018 the orbits of 757,626 minor planets were archived at the minor planet center  516,386 of which had received permanent numbers for the complete list see indexthe first minor planet to be discovered was ceres in 1801 the term minor planet has been used since the 19th century to describe these objects the term planetoid has also been used especially for larger planetary objects such as those the international astronomical union iau has called dwarf planets since 2006 historically the terms asteroid minor planet and planetoid have been more or less synonymous this terminology has become more complicated by the discovery of numerous minor planets beyond the orbit of jupiter especially trans-neptunian objects that are generally not considered asteroids a minor planet seen releasing gas may be dually classified as a comet
objects are called dwarf planets if their own gravity is sufficient to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium and form an ellipsoidal shape all other minor planets and comets are called small solar system bodies the iau stated that the term minor planet may still be used but the term small solar system body will be preferred however for purposes of numbering and naming the traditional distinction between minor planet and comet is still used


 populations 

hundreds of thousands of minor planets have been discovered within the solar system and thousands more are discovered each month the minor planet center has documented over 188 million observations and 757,626 minor planets of which 516,386 have orbits known well enough to be assigned permanent official numbers of these 21,787 have official names as of  30 december 2018 the lowest-numbered unnamed minor planet is 3708 1974 fv1 and the highest-numbered named minor planet is 516560 annapolisroyalthere are various broad minor-planet populations

asteroids traditionally most have been bodies in the inner solar systemnear-earth asteroids those whose orbits take them inside the orbit of mars further subclassification of these based on orbital distance is usedapohele asteroids orbit inside of earths perihelion distance and thus are contained entirely within the orbit of earth
aten asteroids those that have semi-major axes of less than earths and aphelion furthest distance from the sun greater than 0.983 au
apollo asteroids are those asteroids with a semimajor axis greater than earths while having a perihelion distance of 1.017 au or less like aten asteroids apollo asteroids are earth-crossers
amor asteroids are those near-earth asteroids that approach the orbit of earth from beyond but do not cross it amor asteroids are further subdivided into four subgroups depending on where their semimajor axis falls between earths orbit and the asteroid belt
earth trojans asteroids sharing earths orbit and gravitationally locked to it as of 2011 the only one known is 2010 tk7
mars trojans asteroids sharing marss orbit and gravitationally locked to it as of 2007 eight such asteroids are known
asteroid belt whose members follow roughly circular orbits between mars and jupiter these are the original and best-known group of asteroids
jupiter trojans asteroids sharing jupiters orbit and gravitationally locked to it numerically they are estimated to equal the main-belt asteroids
distant minor planets an umbrella term for minor planets in the outer solar system
centaurs bodies in the outer solar system between jupiter and neptune they have unstable orbits due to the gravitational influence of the giant planets and therefore must have come from elsewhere probably outside neptune
neptune trojans bodies sharing neptunes orbit and gravitationally locked to it although only a handful are known there is evidence that neptune trojans are more numerous than either the asteroids in the asteroid belt or the jupiter trojans
trans-neptunian objects bodies at or beyond the orbit of neptune the outermost planet
the kuiper belt objects inside an apparent population drop-off approximately 55 au from the sun
classical kuiper belt objects like makemake also known as cubewanos are in primordial relatively circular orbits that are not in resonance with neptune
resonant kuiper belt objects
plutinos bodies like pluto that are in a 23 resonance with neptune
scattered disc objects like eris with aphelia outside the kuiper belt these are thought to have been scattered by neptune
resonant scattered disc objects
detached objects such as sedna with both aphelia and perihelia outside the kuiper belt
sednoids detached objects with perihelia greater than 75 au sedna and 2012 vp113
the oort cloud a hypothetical population thought to be the source of long-period comets that may extend out to 50,000 au from the sun


 naming conventions 

all astronomical bodies in the solar system need a distinct designation the naming of minor planets runs through a three-step process first a provisional designation is given upon discovery—because the object still may turn out to be a false positive or become lost later on—called a provisionally designated minor planet after the observation arc is accurate enough to predict its future location a minor planet is formally designated and receives a number it is then a numbered minor planet finally in the third step it may be named by its discoverers however only a small fraction of all minor planets have been named the vast majority is either numbered or has still only a provisional designation example of the naming process

1932 ha – provisional designation upon discovery on 24 april 1932
1862 1932 ha – formal designation receives an official number
1862 apollo – named minor planet receives a name the alphanumeric code is dropped


 provisional designation 

a newly discovered minor planet is given a provisional designation for example the provisional designation 2002 at4 consists of the year of discovery 2002 and an alphanumeric code indicating the half-month of discovery and the sequence within that half-month once an asteroids orbit has been confirmed it is given a number and later may also be given a name eg 433 eros the formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number but dropping the parentheses is quite common informally it is common to drop the number altogether or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text
minor planets that have been given a number but not a name keep their provisional designation eg 29075 1950 da because modern discovery techniques are finding vast numbers of new asteroids they are increasingly being left unnamed the earliest discovered to be left unnamed was for a long time 3360 1981 va now 3360 syrinx as of september 2008 this distinction is held by 3708 1974 fv1 on rare occasions a small objects provisional designation may become used as a name in itself the then unnamed 15760 1992 qb1 gave its name to a group of objects that became known as classical kuiper belt objects cubewanos before it was finally named 15760 albion in january 2018a few objects are cross-listed as both comets and asteroids such as 4015 wilson–harrington which is also listed as 107pwilson–harrington


 numbering 

minor planets are awarded an official number once their orbits are confirmed with the increasing rapidity of discovery these are now six-figure numbers the switch from five figures to six figures arrived with the publication of the minor planet circular mpc of october 19 2005 which saw the highest numbered minor planet jump from 99947 to 118161


 naming 

the first few asteroids were named after figures from greek and roman mythology but as such names started to dwindle the names of famous people literary characters discoverers wives children and even television characters were used


 gender 
the first asteroid to be given a non-mythological name was 20 massalia named after the greek name for the city of marseille the first to be given an entirely non-classical name was 45 eugenia named after empress eugénie de montijo the wife of napoleon iii for some time only female or feminized names were used alexander von humboldt was the first man to have an asteroid named after him but his name was feminized to 54 alexandra this unspoken tradition lasted until 334 chicago was named even then female names show up in the list for years after


 eccentric 
as the number of asteroids began to run into the hundreds and eventually in the thousands discoverers began to give them increasingly frivolous names the first hints of this were 482 petrina and 483 seppina named after the discoverers pet dogs however there was little controversy about this until 1971 upon the naming of 2309 mr spock the name of the discoverers cat although the iau subsequently banned pet names as sources eccentric asteroid names are still being proposed and accepted such as 4321 zero 6042 cheshirecat 9007 james bond 13579 allodd and 24680 alleven and 26858 misterrogers


 discoverers name 
a well-established rule is that unlike comets minor planets may not be named after their discoverers one way to circumvent this rule has been for astronomers to exchange the courtesy of naming their discoveries after each other an exception to this rule is 96747 crespodasilva which was named after its discoverer lucy descoffier crespo da silva because she died shortly after the discovery at age 22


 languages 
names were adapted to various languages from the beginning 1 ceres ceres being its anglo-latin name was actually named cerere the italian form of the name german french arabic and hindi use forms similar to the english whereas russian uses a form tserera similar to the italian in greek the name was translated to δήμητρα demeter the greek equivalent of the roman goddess ceres in the early years before it started causing conflicts asteroids named after roman figures were generally translated in greek other examples are ἥρα hera for 3 juno ἑστία hestia for 4 vesta χλωρίσ chloris for 8 flora and πίστη pistis for 37 fides in chinese the names are not given the chinese forms of the deities they are named after but rather typically have a syllable or two for the character of the deity or person followed by 神 goddess or 女 woman if just one syllable plus 星 starplanet so that most asteroid names are written with three chinese characters thus ceres is 穀神星 grain goddess planet pallas is 智神星 wisdom goddess planet etc


 physical properties of comets and minor planets 
commission 15 of the international astronomical union is dedicated to the physical study of comets  minor planets
archival data on the physical properties of comets and minor planets are found in the pds asteroiddust archive this includes standard asteroid physical characteristics such as the properties of binary systems occultation timings and diameters masses densities rotation periods surface temperatures albedoes spin vectors taxonomy and absolute magnitudes and slopes in addition european asteroid research node earn an association of asteroid research groups maintains a data base of physical and dynamical properties of near earth asteroidsmost detailed information is available from category minor planets visited by spacecraft and category comets visited by spacecraft
