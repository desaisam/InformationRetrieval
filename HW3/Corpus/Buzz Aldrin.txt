buzz aldrin  born edwin eugene aldrin jr january 20 1930 is an american engineer and a former astronaut and fighter pilot as lunar module pilot on the apollo 11 mission he and mission commander neil armstrong were the first two humans to land on the moon
born in glen ridge new jersey aldrin graduated from the united states military academy at west point in 1951 with a degree in mechanical engineering he was commissioned into the united states air force and served as a jet fighter pilot during the korean war he flew 66 combat missions and shot down two mig-15 aircraft
after earning a scd degree in astronautics from the massachusetts institute of technology aldrin was selected as a member of nasas astronaut group 3 making him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree his doctoral thesis was line-of-sight guidance techniques for manned orbital rendezvous earning him the nickname dr rendezvous from fellow astronauts his first space flight was in 1966 on gemini 12 during which he spent over five hours on extravehicular activity eva outside the spacecraft three years later aldrin set foot on the moon at 031516 on july 21 1969 utc nine minutes after armstrong first touched the surface while command module pilot michael collins remained in lunar orbit a presbyterian elder aldrin became the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the moon when he privately took communion
upon leaving nasa in 1971 he became commandant of the us air force test pilot school he retired from the air force in 1972 after 21 years of service his autobiographies return to earth 1973 and magnificent desolation 2009 recount his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years after leaving nasa he continued to advocate for space exploration particularly a human mission to mars and developed the aldrin cycler a special spacecraft trajectory that makes travel to mars possible using less time and propellant he has been accorded numerous honors including the presidential medal of freedom in 1969 and is listed in several halls of fame and has plaques on the hollywood walk of fame


 early life 
edwin eugene aldrin jr was born on january 20 1930 at mountainside hospital in glen ridge new jersey his parents edwin eugene aldrin sr and marion aldrin n√©e moon lived in neighboring montclair new jersey his father was an army aviator during world war i and the assistant commandant of the armys test pilot school at mccook field ohio from 1919 to 1922 but left the army in 1928 and became an executive at standard oil aldrin had two siblings both sisters madeleine who was four years older and fay ann who was a year and a half older his nickname which became his legal first name in 1988 arose as a result of fays mispronouncing brother as buzzer which was then shortened to buzz he was a boy scout with the rank of tenderfoot scoutaldrin did well in school maintaining an a average he played football and was the starting center for montclair high schools undefeated 1946 state champion team his father wanted him to go to the united states naval academy in annapolis maryland and enrolled him at nearby severn school a preparatory school for annapolis and even secured him an appointment from albert w hawkes one of the united states senators from new jersey aldrin attended severn school in 1946 but had other ideas about his future career he suffered from seasickness and considered ships a distraction from flying airplanes he faced down his father and told him to ask hawkes to change the nomination to the united states military academy at west point new yorkaldrin entered west point in 1947 he did well academically finishing first in his class his plebe first year he was a member of the academy track and field team in 1950 he traveled with a group of west point cadets to japan and the philippines to study the military government policies of douglas macarthur during his trip the korean war broke out on june 5 1951 he graduated third in the class of 1951 with a bachelor of science degree


 military career 
as one of the highest-ranking members of the class aldrin had his choice of assignments he chose the united states air force which had become a separate service in 1947 while aldrin was still at west point and did not yet have its own academy he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and underwent basic flight training in t-6 texans at bartow air base in florida his classmates included sam johnson who later became a prisoner of war in vietnam the two became friends at one point aldrin attempted a double immelmann turn in a t-28 trojan and suffered a grayout he recovered in time to pull out at 200 feet 61 m averting what would have been a fatal crash

when deciding what sort of aircraft he should fly his father advised him to choose bombers because command of a bomber crew gave an opportunity to learn and hone leadership skills which could open up better prospects for career advancement aldrin chose instead to fly fighters he moved to nellis air force base in las vegas where he learned to fly the f-80 shooting star and the f-86 sabre like most jet fighter pilots of the era he preferred the latterin december 1952 aldrin was assigned to the 16th fighter-interceptor squadron which was part of the 51st fighter-interceptor wing at the time it was based at suwon air base about 20 miles 32 km south of seoul and was engaged in combat operations as part of the korean war during an acclimatization flight his main fuel system froze at 100 percent power which would have soon used up all his fuel he was able to override the setting manually but this required holding a button down which in turn made it impossible to also use his radio he barely managed to make it back under enforced radio silence he flew 66 combat missions in f-86 sabres in korea and shot down two mig-15 aircraftthe first mig-15 he shot down was on may 14 1953 aldrin was flying about 5 miles 8.0 km south of the yalu river when he saw two mig-15 fighters below him aldrin opened fire on one of the migs whose pilot may never have seen him coming the june 8 1953 issue of life magazine featured gun camera footage taken by aldrin of the pilot ejecting from his damaged aircraft

aldrins second aerial victory came on june 4 1953 when he accompanied aircraft from the 39th fighter-interceptor squadron in an attack on an airbase in north korea their newer aircraft were faster than his and he had trouble keeping up he then spotted a mig approaching from above this time aldrin and his opponent spotted each other at about the same time they went through a series of scissor maneuvers attempting to get behind the other aldrin was first to do so but his gun sight jammed he then manually sighted his gun and fired he then had to pull out as the two aircraft had gotten too low for the dogfight to continue aldrin saw the migs canopy open and the pilot eject although aldrin was uncertain whether there was sufficient time for a parachute to open for his service in korea he was awarded two distinguished flying crosses and three air medalsaldrins year-long tour ended in december 1953 by which time the fighting in korea had ended aldrin was assigned as an aerial gunnery instructor at nellis in december 1954 he became an aide-de-camp to brigadier general don z zimmerman the dean of faculty at the nascent united states air force academy which opened in 1955 that same year he graduated from the squadron officer school at maxwell air force base in alabama from 1956 to 1959 he flew f-100 super sabres equipped with nuclear weapons as a flight commander in the 22nd fighter squadron 36th fighter wing stationed at bitburg air base in west germany among his squadron colleagues was ed white who had been a year behind him at west point after white left germany to study for a masters degree at the university of michigan in aeronautical engineering he wrote to aldrin encouraging him to do the same

through the air force institute of technology aldrin enrolled as a graduate student at the massachusetts institute of technology mit in 1959 intending to earn a masters degree his astrodynamics class was taught by richard battin two other usaf officers who later became astronauts david scott and edgar mitchell took this course around this time while another charles duke wrote his 1964 masters degree at mit under the supervision of laurence r youngaldrin enjoyed the classwork and soon decided to pursue a doctorate instead in january 1963 he earned a scd degree in astronautics his doctoral thesis was line-of-sight guidance techniques for manned orbital rendezvous the dedication of which read in the hopes that this work may in some way contribute to their exploration of space this is dedicated to the crew members of this countrys present and future manned space programs if only i could join them in their exciting endeavors aldrin chose his doctoral thesis in the hope that it would help him be selected as an astronaut although it meant foregoing test pilot training which was a prerequisite at the timeon the completion of his doctorate aldrin was assigned to the gemini target office of the air force space systems division in los angeles working with the lockheed aircraft corporation on enhancing the maneuver capabilities of the agena target vehicle which was to be used by nasas project gemini he was then posted to the space systems divisions field office at nasas manned spacecraft center in houston where he was involved in integrating department of defense experiments into project gemini flights


 nasa career 
aldrins initial application to join the astronaut corps when nasas astronaut group 2 was selected in 1962 was rejected on the ground that he was not a test pilot he was aware of the requirement and asked for it to be waived but this request was turned down on may 15 1963 nasa announced another round of selections this time requirement was that applicants had either test pilot experience or 1,000 hours flying time in jet aircraft and aldrin had over 2,500 hours of flying time of which 2,200 was in jets his selection as one of fourteen members of nasas astronaut group 3 was publicly announced on october 18 1963 this made him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree combined with his expertise in orbital mechanics it earned him his nickname from his fellow astronauts from the outset walter cunningham a fellow member of the 1963 group recalled buzz was referred to as dr rendezvous because of his obsession with rendezvous in space aldrin was aware that it was not always intended as a complimenton completion of their initial astronaut training each of the new astronauts  was assigned a field of expertise that they were to specialize in in aldrins case this was mission planning trajectory analysis and flight plans


 gemini program 

jim lovell and aldrin were selected as the backup commander and pilot respectively of gemini 10 backup crews usually became the prime crew of the third following mission but in this case that would be gemini 13 which did not exist the last scheduled mission in the program was gemini 12 but the february 28 1966 deaths of the gemini 9 prime crew elliot see and charles bassett in an air crash led to lovell and aldrin being moved up one mission on march 21 to backup for gemini 9 which put them in position as prime crew for gemini 12 they were officially designated its prime crew on june 17 1966 with gordon cooper and gene cernan as their backups


 gemini 12 

initially gemini 12s mission objectives were uncertain as the last scheduled mission it was primarily intended to complete tasks that had not been successfully or fully carried out on earlier missions while nasa had successfully performed rendezvous during project gemini the gravity-gradient stabilization test on gemini 11 was unsuccessful nasa also had concerns about extra-vehicular activity eva cernan on gemini 9 and richard gordon on gemini 11 had suffered from fatigue carrying out tasks during eva but michael collins had a successful eva on gemini 10 which suggested that the order in which he had performed his tasks was an important factorit therefore fell to aldrin to complete geminis eva goals nasa formed a committee to give him a better chance of success it dropped the test of the air forces astronaut maneuvering unit amu that had given gordon trouble on gemini 11 so aldrin could focus on eva nasa revamped the training program opting for underwater training over parabolic flight aircraft flying a parabolic trajectory had given astronauts an experience of weightlessness in training but there was a delay between each parabola which gave astronauts several minutes of rest it also encouraged performing tasks quickly whereas in space they had to be done slowly and deliberately training in a viscous buoyant fluid gave a better simulation nasa also placed additional handholds on the capsule which were increased from 9 on gemini 9 to 44 on gemini 12 and created workstations where he could anchor his feet

gemini 12s main objectives were to rendezvous with a target vehicle and fly the spacecraft and target vehicle together using gravity-gradient stabilization perform docked maneuvers using the agena propulsion system to change orbit conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise and three evas and demonstrate an automatic reentry gemini 12 also carried 14 scientific medical and technological experiments it was not a trailblazing mission rendezvous from above had already been successfully performed by gemini 9 and the tethered vehicle exercise by gemini 11 even gravity-gradient stabilization had been attempted by gemini 11 albeit unsuccessfullygemini 12 was launched from launch complex 19 at cape canaveral on 2046 utc on november 11 1966 the gemini agena target vehicle had been launched about an hour and a half before the missions first major objective was to rendezvous with this target vehicle as the target and gemini 12 capsule drew closer together radar contact between the two deteriorated until it became unusable forcing the crew to rendezvous manually aldrin used a sextant and rendezvous charts he helped create to give lovell the right information to put the spacecraft in position to dock with the target vehicle gemini 12 achieved the fourth docking with an agena target vehiclethe next task was to practice undocking and docking again on undocking one of the three latches caught and lovell had to use the geminis thrusters to free the spacecraft aldrin then docked again successfully a few minutes later the flight plan then called for the agena main engine to be fired to take the docked spacecraft into a higher orbit but eight minutes after the agena had been launched it had suffered a loss of chamber pressure the mission and flight directors therefore decided not to risk the main engine this would be the only mission objective that was not achieved instead the agenas secondary propulsion system was used to allow the spacecraft to view the solar eclipse of november 12 1966 over south america which lovell and aldrin photographed through the spacecraft windows

aldrin performed three evas the first was a standup eva on november 12 in which the spacecraft door was opened and he stood up but did not leave the spacecraft the standup eva mimicked some of the actions he would do during his free-flight eva so he could compare the effort expended between the two it set an eva record of two hours and 20 minutes the next day aldrin performed his free-flight eva he climbed across the newly installed hand-holds to the agena and installed the cable needed for the gravity-gradient stabilization experiment aldrin performed numerous tasks including installing electrical connectors and testing tools that would be needed for project apollo a dozen two-minute rest periods prevented him from becoming fatigued his second eva concluded after two hours and six minutes a third 55-minute standup eva was conducted on november 14 during which aldrin took photographs conducted experiments and discarded some unneeded itemson november 15 the crew initiated the automatic reentry system and splashed down in the atlantic ocean from whence they were picked up by a helicopter which took them to the awaiting aircraft carrier uss wasp after the mission his wife realized he had fallen into a depression something she had not seen before


 apollo program 

lovell and aldrin were assigned to an apollo crew with neil armstrong as commander lovell as command module pilot cmp and aldrin as lunar module pilot lmp their assignment as the backup crew of apollo 9 was officially announced on november 20 1967 due to design and manufacturing delays in the lunar module lm apollo 8 and apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews and armstrongs crew became the backup for apollo 8 under the normal crew rotation scheme armstrong was then expected to command apollo 11

michael collins the cmp on the apollo 8 prime crew experienced trouble with his legs that required surgery to remove a bone spur on his spine lovell took his place on the apollo 8 crew when collins recovered he joined armstrongs crew as cmp in the meantime fred haise filled in as backup lmp and aldrin as backup cmp for apollo 8 an effect of this was that while the cmp usually occupied the center couch on takeoff aldrin occupied it rather than collins as he had already been trained to operate its console on liftoff before collins arrivedapollo 11 was the second crew of an american space mission made up entirely of astronauts who had already flown in space the first being that of apollo 10 the next would not be flown until sts-26 in 1988 deke slayton who was responsible for astronaut flight assignments gave armstrong the option to replace aldrin with lovell since some thought aldrin was difficult to work with armstrong thought it over for a day before declining he had no issues working with aldrin and thought lovell deserved his own commandearly versions of the eva checklist had the lunar module pilot as the first to step onto the lunar surface however when aldrin learned that this might be amended he lobbied within nasa for the original procedure to be followed multiple factors contributed to the final decision including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander which made it easier for armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft furthermore there was little support for aldrins views among senior astronauts who would command later apollo missions collins has commented that he thought aldrin resents not being first on the moon more than he appreciates being second
aldrin and armstrong did not have time to perform much geological training the first lunar landing focused more on landing on the moon and making it safely back to earth than the scientific aspects of the mission the duo were briefed by nasa and usgs geologists they made one geological field trip to west texas the press followed them and a helicopter made it hard for aldrin and armstrong to hear their instructor


 apollo 11 

an estimated one million spectators watched the launch of apollo 11 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of the launch site the launch was televised live in 33 countries with an estimated 25 million viewers in the united states alone millions more listened to radio broadcasts propelled by a giant saturn v rocket apollo 11 lifted off from launch complex 39 at the kennedy space center on july 16 1969 at 133200 utc 93200 edt and entered earth orbit twelve minutes later after one and a half orbits the s-ivb third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the moon about 30 minutes later the transposition docking and extraction maneuver was performed this involved separating the command module columbia from the spent s-ivb stage turning around and docking with lunar module eagle after the lunar module was extracted the combined spacecraft headed for the moon while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the moon

on july 19 at 172150 utc apollo 11 passed behind the moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit in the thirty orbits that followed the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern sea of tranquillity about 12 miles 19 km southwest of the crater sabine d at 125200 utc on july 20 aldrin and armstrong entered eagle and began the final preparations for lunar descent at 174400 eagle separated from the columbia collins alone aboard columbia inspected eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged and that the landing gear was correctly deployedthroughout the descent aldrin called out navigation data to armstrong who was busy piloting the eagle five minutes into the descent burn and 6,000 feet 1,800 m above the surface of the moon the lm guidance computer lgc distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected alarms that indicated that it could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them the eagle landed at 201740 utc on sunday july 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel leftaldrin a presbyterian elder was the first and only person to hold a religious ceremony on the moon he radioed earth id like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in whoever and wherever they may be to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way using a kit given to him by his pastor he took communion but he kept it secret because of a lawsuit over the reading of genesis on apollo 8 in 1970 he noted it was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon and the first food eaten there were communion elements on reflection in his 2009 book aldrin felt that perhaps if i had it to do over again i would not choose to celebrate communion although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me it was a christian sacrament and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind ‚Äì be they christians jews muslims animists agnostics or atheists but at the time i could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the apollo 11 experience than by giving thanks to godpreparations for the eva began at 2343 once armstrong and aldrin were ready to go outside eagle was depressurized and the hatch was opened at 023933 on july 21 aldrin set foot on the moon at 031516 on july 21 1969 utc nine minutes after armstrong first touched the surface armstrong and aldrin became the first and second people respectively to walk on the moon aldrins first words after he set foot on the moon were beautiful view to which armstrong asked isnt that something magnificent sight out here aldrin answered magnificent desolation aldrin and armstrong had trouble erecting the lunar flag assembly but with some effort secured it into the surface aldrin saluted the flag and armstrong took an iconic photo of the scene aldrin positioned himself in front of the video camera and began experimenting with different locomotion methods to move about the lunar surface to aid future moonwalkers during his experiments president nixon called the duo to congratulate them on the successful landing nixon closed with thank you very much and all of us look forward to seeing you on the hornet on thursday aldrin replied i look forward to that very much sirafter the call aldrin began photographing and inspecting the spacecraft to document and verify its condition before their flight aldrin and armstrong then set up a seismometer to detect moonquakes and a laser beam reflector while armstrong inspected a crater aldrin began the difficult task of hammering a metal tube into the surface to obtain a core sample

most of the iconic photographs of an astronaut on the moon taken by the apollo 11 astronauts are of aldrin armstrong appears in just two color photographs as the sequence of lunar operations evolved aldrin explained neil had the camera most of the time and the majority of the pictures taken on the moon that include an astronaut are of me it wasnt until we were back on earth and in the lunar receiving laboratory looking over the pictures that we realized there were few pictures of neil my fault perhaps but we had never simulated this during our trainingaldrin reentered eagle first with some difficulty they lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms 47.5 lb of lunar surface material to the hatch using a flat cable pulley device armstrong reminded aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket and aldrin tossed the bag down it contained a mission patch for the apollo 1 flight that ed white never flew due to his death in the fire medallions commemorating yuri gagarin the first man in space and vladimir komarov the first man to die in a space flight and a silicon disk etched with goodwill messages from 73 nations after transferring to lm life support the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their backpacks lunar overshoes an empty hasselblad camera and other equipment the hatch was closed again at 0501 and they repressurized the lunar module and settled down to sleepat 1754 utc they lifted off in eagles ascent stage to rejoin collins aboard columbia in lunar orbit after rendezvous with columbia the ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit and columbia made its way back to earth it splashed down in the pacific 2,660 km 1,440 nmi east of wake island at 1650 utc 0550 local time on july 24 the total mission duration was 195 hours 18 minutes 35 secondsthis mission allowed aldrin to maintain his record eva duration until it was surpassed in the apollo 14 mission the chance of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered a remote possibility so divers passed biological isolation garments bigs to the astronauts and assisted them into the life raft the astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter and flown to the aircraft carrier uss hornet where they spent the first part of the earth-based portion of 21 days of quarantine
on august 13 the three astronauts rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in new york and chicago attended by an estimated six million people an official state dinner that evening in los angeles celebrated the flight president richard nixon honored each of them with a presentation of the highest award a civilian can receive the presidential medal of freedomon september 16 1969 the astronauts addressed a joint session of congress where they thanked the representatives for their past support and implored them to continue funding the space effort the astronauts embarked on a 38-day world tour on september 29 that brought the astronauts to 22 foreign countries and included visits with leaders of multiple countries the last leg of the tour included australia korea and japan the crew returned to the us on november 5 1969
after apollo 11 aldrin was kept busy giving speeches and making public appearances in october 1970 he joined soviet cosmonauts andriyan nikolayev and vitaly sevastyanov on their tour of the nasa space centers he was also involved in the design of the space shuttle  with the apollo program coming to an end aldrin now a colonel saw few prospects at nasa and decided to return to the air force on july 1 1971 during his nasa career he had spent 289 hours and 53 minutes in space of which 7 hours and 52 minutes was in eva


 post-nasa activities 


 aerospace research pilot school 

aldrin hoped to become commandant of cadets at the united states air force academy however this job was given to his west point classmate hoyt s vandenberg jr aldrin was assigned as commandant of the usaf aerospace research pilot school at edwards air force base california aldrin had neither managerial nor test pilot experience but a third of the training curriculum was devoted to astronaut training and students flew a modified f-104 starfighter to the edge of space fellow group 3 astronaut and moonwalker alan bean considered him well-qualified for the jobaldrin did not get along well with his superior brigadier general robert m white who had earned his usaf astronaut wings flying the x-15 aldrins celebrity status led people to defer to him more than the higher-ranking general there were two crashes at edwards of an a-7 corsair ii and a t-33 no lives were lost but the aircraft were destroyed and the accidents were attributed to insufficient supervision which placed the blame on aldrin what he had hoped would be an enjoyable job became a highly stressful onealdrin went to see the base surgeon in addition to signs of depression he experienced neck and shoulder pains and hoped that the latter might explain the former he was hospitalized for depression at wilford hall medical center for four weeks his mother had committed suicide in may 1968 and he was plagued with guilt that his fame after gemini 12 had contributed his mothers father had also committed suicide and he believed he inherited depression from them at the time there was great stigma related to mental illness and he was aware that it could not only be career-ending but could result in being ostracized sociallyin february 1972 general george s brown paid a visit to edwards and informed aldrin that the usaf aerospace research pilot school was being renamed the usaf test pilot school and the astronaut training was being dropped with the apollo program winding down and air force budgets being cut the air forces interest in space diminished aldrin elected to retire as a colonel on march 1 1972 after 21 years of service his father and general jimmy doolittle a close friend of his father attended the formal retirement ceremonyaldrins father died on december 28 1974 from complications following a heart attack his autobiographies return to earth 1973 and magnificent desolation 2009 recounted aldrins struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years after leaving nasa he was reduced to selling used cars at which he had no talent periods of hospitalization and sobriety alternated with bouts of heavy drinking eventually he was arrested for disorderly conduct finally in october 1978 he quit drinking for good aldrin attempted to help others with drinking problems including actor william holden holdens girlfriend stefanie powers had portrayed marianne a woman with whom aldrin had an affair in the tv movie version of return to earth aldrin was saddened by holdens alcohol-related death in 1981


 bart sibrel incident 
on september 9 2002 aldrin was lured to a beverly hills hotel on the pretext of being interviewed for a japanese childrens television show on the subject of space when he arrived moon landing conspiracy theorist bart sibrel accosted him with a film crew and demanded he swear on a bible that the moon landings were not faked after a brief confrontation during which sibrel followed aldrin despite being told to leave him alone and called him thief liar and coward the 72-year-old aldrin punched sibrel in the jaw which was caught on camera by sibrels film crew aldrin stated that he had acted to defend himself and his stepdaughter witnesses stated that sibrel had aggressively poked aldrin with a bible additional mitigating factors were that sibrel sustained no visible injury and did not seek medical attention and that aldrin had no criminal record the police declined to press charges against aldrin


 detached adapter panel sighting 
in 2005 while being interviewed for a science channel documentary titled first on the moon the untold story aldrin told an interviewer that they saw an unidentified flying object the documentary makers omitted the crews conclusion that they probably saw one of the four detached spacecraft adapter panels from the upper stage of the saturn v rocket the panels had been jettisoned before the separation maneuver so they closely followed the spacecraft until the first mid-course correction when aldrin appeared on the howard stern show on august 15 2007 stern asked him about the supposed ufo sighting aldrin confirmed that there was no such sighting of anything deemed extraterrestrial and said they were and are 99.9 percent sure that the object was the detached panel according to aldrin his words had been taken out of context he made a request to the science channel to make a correction but was refused


 polar expedition 
in december 2016 aldrin was part of a tourist group visiting the amundsen‚Äìscott south pole station in antarctica when he fell ill and was evacuated first to mcmurdo station and from there to christchurch new zealand at 86 years of age aldrins visit made him the oldest person to reach the south pole he had traveled to the north pole in 1998


 mission to mars advocacy 

after leaving nasa aldrin continued to advocate for space exploration in 1985 he joined the university of north dakota unds college of aerospace sciences at the invitation of john d odegard the dean of the college aldrin helped to develop unds space studies program and brought dr david webb from nasa to serve as the departments first chair to further promote space exploration and to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the first lunar landing aldrin teamed up with snoop dogg quincy jones talib kweli and soulja boy to create the rap single and video rocket experience proceeds from which were donated to aldrins non-profit foundation sharespacein 1985 aldrin proposed a special spacecraft trajectory now known as the aldrin cycler cycler trajectories offer reduced cost of repeated travel to mars by using less propellant the aldrin cycler provided a five and a half month journey from the earth to mars with a return trip to earth of the same duration on a twin cycler orbit aldrin continues to research this concept with engineers from purdue universityin december 2003 aldrin published an opinion piece in the new york times criticizing nasas objectives in it he voiced concern about nasas development of a spacecraft limited to transporting four astronauts at a time with little or no cargo carrying capability and declared the goal of sending astronauts back to the moon was more like reaching for past glory than striving for new triumphsin a june 2013 opinion piece in the new york times aldrin supported a human mission to mars and which viewed the moon not as a destination but more a point of departure one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead mars and become a two-planet species in august 2015 aldrin in association with the florida institute of technology presented a master plan to nasa for consideration where astronauts with a tour of duty of ten years establish a colony on mars before the year 2040


 awards and honors 

aldrin was awarded the air force distinguished service medal dsm in 1969 for his role as lunar module pilot on apollo 11 he was awarded an oak leaf cluster in 1972 in lieu of a second dsm for his role in both the korean war and in the space program and the legion of merit for his role in the gemini and apollo programs during a 1966 ceremony marking the end of the gemini program aldrin was awarded the nasa exceptional service medal by president johnson at lbj ranch he was awarded the nasa distinguished service medal in 1970 for the apollo 11 mission aldrin was one of ten gemini astronauts inducted into the international space hall of fame in 1982 he was also inducted into the us astronaut hall of fame in 1993 the national aviation hall of fame in 2000 and the new jersey hall of fame in 2008
