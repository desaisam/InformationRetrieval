 etymology 
the name belarus is closely related with the term belaya rus ie white rus there are several claims to the origin of the name white rus an ethno-religious theory suggests that the name used to describe the part of old ruthenian lands within the grand duchy of lithuania that had been populated mostly by slavs who had been christianized early as opposed to black ruthenia which was predominantly inhabited by pagan baltsan alternate explanation for the name comments on the white clothing worn by the local slavic population a third theory suggests that the old rus lands that were not conquered by the tatars ie polotsk vitebsk and mogilev had been referred to as white rusthe name rus is often conflated with its latin forms russia and ruthenia thus belarus is often referred to as white russia or white ruthenia the name first appeared in german and latin medieval literature the chronicles of jan of czarnków mention the imprisonment of lithuanian grand duke jogaila and his mother at albae russiae poloczk dicto in 1381 in some languages including german afrikaans and dutch the country is generally called white russia to this day weissrussland and wit-rusland respectivelythe latin term alba russia was used again by pope pius vi in 1783 to recognize the society of jesus there exclaiming approbo societatem jesu in alba russia degentem approbo approbo the first known use of white russia to refer to belarus was in the late-16th century by englishman sir jerome horsey who was known for his close contacts with the russian royal court during the 17th century the russian tsars used white rus to describe the lands added from the grand duchy of lithuania

the term belorussia russian белору́ссия the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from росси́я russia first rose in the days of the russian empire and the russian tsar was usually styled the tsar of all the russias as russia or the russian empire was formed by three parts of russia—the great little and white this asserted that the territories are all russian and all the peoples are also russian in the case of the belarusians they were variants of the russian peopleafter the bolshevik revolution in 1917 the term white russia caused some confusion as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red bolsheviks during the period of the byelorussian ssr the term byelorussia was embraced as part of a national consciousness in western belarus under polish control byelorussia became commonly used in the regions of białystok and grodno during the interwar periodthe term byelorussia its names in other languages such as english being based on the russian form was only used officially until 1991 when the supreme soviet of the byelorussian ssr decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called republic of belarus республика беларусь spelled in russian and that its abridged form should be belarus the law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their belarusian language forms the use of byelorussian ssr and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991 to 1993 conservative forces in the newly independent belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the constitution of belarusaccordingly the name byelorussia was replaced by belarus in english likewise the adjective belorussian or byelorussian was replaced by belarusian in english belarusian is closer to the original belarusian term of bielaruski belarusian intelligentsia in the stalin era attempted to change the name from byelorussia to a form of krivia because of the supposed connection with russia some nationalists object to the name for the same reason several local newspapers kept the old name of the country in russian in their names for example komsomolskaya pravda v byelorussii which is the localized publication of a popular russian newspaper also those who wish for belarus to be reunited with russia continue to use belorussia officially the full name of the country is republic of belarus рэспубліка беларусь республика беларусь respublika belarus listen 


 history 


 early history 
from 5000 to 2000 bc bandkeramik cultures predominated in addition remains from the dnieper-donets culture were found in belarus and parts of ukraine cimmerians and other pastoralists roamed through the area by 1,000 bc and by 500 ad slavs had taken up residence which was circumscribed by the scythians who roamed its outskirts invaders from asia among whom were the huns and avars swept through c 400–600 ad but were unable to dislodge the slavic presence

the region that is now belarus was first settled by baltic tribes in the 3rd century around the 5th century the area was taken over by slavic tribes the takeover was partially due to the lack of military coordination of the balts but the gradual assimilation of the balts into slavic culture was peaceful in naturein the 9th century the territory of modern belarus became part of kievan rus a vast east slavic state ruled by the rurikid dynasty upon the death of kievan rus ruler yaroslav i the wise the state split into independent principalities many early rus principalities were virtually razed or severely affected by a major mongol invasion in the 13th century but the lands of modern belarus avoided the brunt of the invasion and were eventually joined the grand duchy of lithuania

there are no sources of military seizure but the annals affirm the alliance and united foreign policy of polotsk and lithuania for decades for example the chronicle of novgorod informs about izyaslav had been set to be knyaz in luki and covered novgorod from the lithuanians in 1198 when luki is situated on the east from polotskincorporation into the grand duchy of lithuania resulted in an economic political and ethno-cultural unification of belarusian lands of the principalities held by the duchy nine of them were settled by a population that would eventually become belarusian people during this time the duchy was involved in several military campaigns including fighting on the side of poland against the teutonic knights at the battle of grunwald in 1410 the joint victory allowed the duchy to control the northwestern borderlands of eastern europethe muscovites led by ivan iii of moscow began military campaigns in 1486 in an attempt to incorporate the lands of kievan rus specifically the territories of modern belarus russia and ukraine


 polish–lithuanian commonwealth 

on 2 february 1386 the grand duchy of lithuania and the kingdom of poland were joined in a personal union through a marriage of their rulers this union set in motion the developments that eventually resulted in the formation of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth created in 1569 by the union of lublin

the lithuanian nobles were forced to go for rapprochement because of the threat coming from muscovy
to strengthen the independence in the format of the union three editions of the statutes of lithuania were issued in the 16th century 
the third article of the statute establishes that all lands of grand duchy of lithuania will be eternally in grand duchy of lithuania and never enter as a part of other states it allowed to own the land within grand duchy of lithuania only to own families anyone from outside duchy would be honored with property only own it after swearing to grand duke of lithuania these articles were aimed to defend the rights of the grand duchy of lithuania nobility against polish prussian and other aristocracy of polish–lithuanian commonwealth
in the years following the union the process of gradual polonization of both lithuanians and ruthenians gained steady momentum in culture and social life both the polish language and catholicism became dominant and in 1696 polish replaced ruthenian as the official language—with the ruthenian language being banned from administrative use however the ruthenian peasants continued to speak their own language and remained faithful to the belarusian greek catholic church statutes were initially only issued in ruthenian language and later also in polish around 1840 the statutes were banned by the russian tsar following the november uprising modern ukrainian lands used it until 1860s


 russian empire 

the union between poland and lithuania ended in 1795 with the third partition of poland by imperial russia prussia and austria the belarusian territories acquired by the russian empire under the reign of catherine ii were included into the belarusian governorate russian белорусское генерал-губернаторство in 1796 and held until their occupation by the german empire during world war iunder nicholas i and alexander iii the national cultures were repressed policies of polonization changed by russification which included the return to orthodox christianity of belorusian uniates belarusian language was banned in schools while in neighboring samogitia primary school education with samogitian literacy was allowedin a russification drive in the 1840s nicholas i prohibited use of the belarusian language in public schools campaigned against belarusian publications and tried to pressure those who had converted to catholicism under the poles to reconvert to the orthodox faith in 1863 economic and cultural pressure exploded in a revolt led by konstanty kalinowski after the failed revolt the russian government reintroduced the use of cyrillic to belarusian in 1864 and no documents in belarusian were permitted by the russian government until 1905during the negotiations of the treaty of brest-litovsk belarus first declared independence under german occupation on 25 march 1918 forming the belarusian peoples republic immediately afterwards the polish–soviet war ignited and the territory of belarus was divided between poland and soviet russia
the rada of the belarusian democratic republic exists as a government in exile ever since then in fact it is currently the worlds longest serving government in exile


 belarusian peoples republic 

the belarusian peoples republic was the first attempt to create an independent belarusian state under name belarus despite significant efforts the state ceased to exist primarily due to the fact that the territory was continually dominated by the german imperial army and the imperial russian army in world war i and than the bolshevik red army it existed only from 1918 to 1919 but created prerequisites for the formation of the state idea around the name belarus the choice of the name was probably based the fact that the educated core of the newly formed government was educated in the tsardom universities with a corresponding education around the ideology of west-russianism


 republic of central lithuania 
the republic of central lithuania was a short-lived political entity which was the last attempt to restore lithuania in the historical confederacy state it was also supposed to create lithuania upper and lithuania lower the republic was created in 1920 following the staged rebellion of soldiers of the 1st lithuanian–belarusian division of the polish army under lucjan żeligowski centered on the historical capital of the grand duchy of lithuania vilna lithuanian vilnius polish wilno for 18 months the entity served as a buffer state between poland upon which it depended and lithuania which claimed the area after a variety of delays a disputed election took place on 8 january 1922 and the territory was annexed to poland żeligowski later in his memoir which was published in london in 1943 condemned the annexation of republic by poland as well as the policy of closing belarusian schools and general disregard of marshal józef piłsudskis confederation plans by polish ally years earlier interrogation report of 19-year-old revolutionary pilsudski of march 10 1887 indicated that he called himself a belarusian nobleman


 byelorussian soviet socialist republic 

a part of belarus under russian rule emerged as the byelorussian soviet socialist republic byelorussian ssr in 1919 soon thereafter it merged to form the lithuanian-byelorussian ssr the contested lands were divided between poland and the soviet union after the war ended in 1921 and the byelorussian ssr became a founding member of the union of soviet socialist republics in 1922 the western part of modern belarus remained part of polandin the 1920s and 1930s soviet agricultural and economic policies including collectivization and five-year plans for the national economy led to famine and political repression

in 1939 nazi germany and the soviet union invaded and occupied poland marking the beginning of world war ii the soviets invaded and annexed much of eastern poland which had been part of the country since the peace of riga two decades earlier much of the northern section of this area was added to the byelorussian ssr and now constitutes west belarus the soviet-controlled byelorussian peoples council officially took control of the territories whose populations consisted of a mixture of poles ukrainians belarusians and jews on 28 october 1939 in białystok nazi germany invaded the soviet union in 1941 the brest fortress which had been annexed in 1939 at this time was subjected to one of the most destructive onslaughts that happened during the war statistically the byelorussian ssr was the hardest-hit soviet republic in world war ii it remained in nazi hands until 1944 during that time germany destroyed 209 out of 290 cities in the republic 85% of the republics industry and more than one million buildings the nazi generalplan ost called for the extermination expulsion or enslavement of most or all belarusians for the purpose of providing more living space in the east for germanscasualties were estimated to be between 2 and 3 million about a quarter to one-third of the total population while the jewish population of belarus was devastated during the holocaust and never recovered the population of belarus did not regain its pre-war level until 1971 it was also after this conflict that the final borders of belarus were set by stalin when parts of belarusian territory were given to the recently annexed lithuania

after the war belarus was among the 51 founding countries of the united nations charter and as such it was allowed an additional vote at the un on top of the soviet unions vote vigorous postwar reconstruction promptly followed the end of the war and the byelorussian ssr became a major center of manufacturing in the western ussr creating jobs and attracting ethnic russians the borders of the byelorussian ssr and poland were redrawn in accord with the 1919-proposed curzon linejoseph stalin implemented a policy of sovietization to isolate the byelorussian ssr from western influences this policy involved sending russians from various parts of the soviet union and placing them in key positions in the byelorussian ssr government after stalins death in 1953 nikita khrushchev continued his predecessors cultural hegemony program stating the sooner we all start speaking russian the faster we shall build communismin 1986 the byelorussian ssr was exposed to significant nuclear fallout from the explosion at the chernobyl power plant in the neighboring ukrainian ssrin june 1988 the archaeologist and leader of the christian conservative party of the bpf zyanon paznyak discovered mass graves of victims executed in 1937–41 at kurapaty near minsk some nationalists contend that this discovery is proof that the soviet government was trying to erase the belarusian people causing belarusian nationalists to seek independence


 independence 
in march 1990 elections for seats in the supreme soviet of the byelorussian ssr took place though the pro-independence belarusian popular front took only 10% of the seats the populace was content with the selection of the delegates belarus declared itself sovereign on 27 july 1990 by issuing the declaration of state sovereignty of the belarusian soviet socialist republic
with the support of the communist party the countrys name was changed to the republic of belarus on 25 august 1991 stanislav shushkevich the chairman of the supreme soviet of belarus met with boris yeltsin of russia and leonid kravchuk of ukraine on 8 december 1991 in belavezhskaya pushcha to formally declare the dissolution of the soviet union and the formation of the commonwealth of independent statesa national constitution was adopted in march 1994 in which the functions of prime minister were given to the president of belarus


 post-independence 

two-round elections for the presidency on 24 june 1994 and 10 july 1994 catapulted the formerly unknown alexander lukashenko into national prominence he garnered 45% of the vote in the first round and 80% in the second defeating vyacheslav kebich who received 14% of the vote lukashenko was re-elected in 2001 in 2006 in 2010 and again in 2015 western governments amnesty international and human rights watch have criticized lukashenkos authoritarian style of government
since 2014 following years of embrace of russian influence in the country lukashenko has pressed a revival of belarusian identity following the russian annexation of crimea and military intervention in eastern ukraine for the first time he delivered a speech in belarusian rather than russian which most people use in which he said we are not russian—we are belarusians and later encouraged the use of belarusian trade disputes a border dispute and a much relaxed official attitude to dissident voices are all part of a weakening of the longtime warm relationship with russiain 2019 lukashenko had bilateral talks in sochi with russian president vladimir putin and declared that their two countries could unite tomorrow no problem an idea backed by putin for years observers have labeled the potential plan a scheme by putin to remain in power beyond 2024 however political scientist mikhail vinogradov explained that lukashenko will play tough to the public while trying to look weak in front of putin and the carnegie moscow centers artyom shraibman suggested that moscow will most likely fail to find its base among belarusians
