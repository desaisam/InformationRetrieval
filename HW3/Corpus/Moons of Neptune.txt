neptune has 14 known moons which are named for minor water deities in greek mythology by far the largest of them is triton discovered by william lassell on october 10 1846 17 days after the discovery of neptune itself over a century passed before the discovery of the second natural satellite nereid neptunes outermost moon neso which has an orbital period of about 26 julian years orbits further from its planet than any other moon in the solar systemtriton is unique among moons of planetary mass in that its orbit is retrograde to neptunes rotation and inclined relative to neptunes equator which suggests that it did not form in orbit around neptune but was instead gravitationally captured by it the next-largest irregular satellite in the solar system saturns moon phoebe has only 0.03% of tritons mass the capture of triton probably occurring some time after neptune formed a satellite system was a catastrophic event for neptunes original satellites disrupting their orbits so that they collided to form a rubble disc triton is massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and to retain a thin atmosphere capable of forming clouds and hazes
inward of triton are seven small regular satellites all of which have prograde orbits in planes that lie close to neptunes equatorial plane some of these orbit among neptunes rings the largest of them is proteus they were re-accreted from the rubble disc generated after tritons capture after the tritonian orbit became circular neptune also has six more outer irregular satellites other than triton including nereid whose orbits are much farther from neptune and at high inclination three of these have prograde orbits while the remainder have retrograde orbits in particular nereid has an unusually close and eccentric orbit for an irregular satellite suggesting that it may have once been a regular satellite that was significantly perturbed to its current position when triton was captured the two outermost neptunian irregular satellites psamathe and neso have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered in the solar system to date


 history 


 discovery 
triton was discovered by william lassell in 1846 just seventeen days after the discovery of neptune nereid was discovered by gerard p kuiper in 1949 the third moon later named larissa was first observed by harold j reitsema william b hubbard larry a lebofsky and david j tholen on may 24 1981 the astronomers were observing a stars close approach to neptune looking for rings similar to those discovered around uranus four years earlier if rings were present the stars luminosity would decrease slightly just before the planets closest approach the stars luminosity dipped only for several seconds which meant that it was due to a moon rather than a ring
no further moons were found until voyager 2 flew by neptune in 1989 voyager 2 rediscovered larissa and discovered five inner moons naiad thalassa despina galatea and proteus in 2001 two surveys using large ground-based telescopes found five additional outer moons bringing the total to thirteen follow-up surveys by two teams in 2002 and 2003 respectively re-observed all five of these moons which are halimede sao psamathe laomedeia and neso a sixth candidate moon was also found in the 2002 survey and was lost thereafter it may have been a centaur instead of a satellite although its small amount of motion relative to neptune over a month suggests that it was indeed a satellite it was estimated to have a diameter of  33 km and to have been about 25.1 million km 0.168 au from neptune when it was foundmark showalter discovered hippocamp on 1 july 2013 while examining hubble space telescope hst images of neptunes ring arcs from 2009 he used a technique similar to panning to compensate for orbital motion and allow stacking of multiple images to bring out faint details after deciding on a whim to expand the search area to radii well beyond the rings he found the fairly obvious dot that represented the new moon he then found it repeatedly in other archival hst images going back to 2004 voyager 2 which had observed all of neptunes other inner satellites did not detect it during its 1989 flyby due to its dimness


 names 

triton did not have an official name until the twentieth century the name triton was suggested by camille flammarion in his 1880 book astronomie populaire but it did not come into common use until at least the 1930s until this time it was usually simply known as the satellite of neptune other moons of neptune are also named for greek and roman water gods in keeping with neptunes position as god of the sea either from greek mythology usually children of poseidon the greek neptune triton proteus despina thalassa lovers of poseidon larissa classes of minor greek water deities naiad nereid or specific nereids halimede galatea neso sao laomedeia psamathe the most recently discovered moon hippocamp was left unnamed on its official numbering until february 2019 when it was named after the hippocamp a mythological creature that was half horse and half fishfor the normal irregular satellites the general convention is to use names ending in a for prograde satellites names ending in e for retrograde satellites and names ending in o for exceptionally inclined satellites exactly like the convention for the moons of jupiter two asteroids share the same names as moons of neptune 74 galatea and 1162 larissa


 characteristics 
the moons of neptune can be divided into two groups regular and irregular the first group includes the seven inner moons which follow circular prograde orbits lying in the equatorial plane of neptune the second group consists of all seven other moons including triton they generally follow inclined eccentric and often retrograde orbits far from neptune the only exception is triton which orbits close to the planet following a circular orbit though retrograde and inclined


 regular moons 
in order of distance from neptune the regular moons are naiad thalassa despina galatea larissa hippocamp and proteus all but the outer two are within neptune-synchronous orbit neptunes rotational period is 0.6713 day and thus are being tidally decelerated naiad the closest regular moon is also the second smallest among the inner moons following the discovery of hippocamp whereas proteus is the largest regular moon and the second largest moon of neptune
the inner moons are closely associated with neptunes rings the two innermost satellites naiad and thalassa orbit between the galle and leverrier rings despina may be a shepherd moon of the leverrier ring because its orbit lies just inside this ring the next moon galatea orbits just inside the most prominent of neptunes rings the adams ring this ring is very narrow with a width not exceeding 50 km and has five embedded bright arcs the gravity of galatea helps confine the ring particles within a limited region in the radial direction maintaining the narrow ring various resonances between the ring particles and galatea may also have a role in maintaining the arcsonly the two largest regular moons have been imaged with a resolution sufficient to discern their shapes and surface features larissa about 200 km in diameter is elongated proteus is not significantly elongated but not fully spherical either it resembles an irregular polyhedron with several flat or slightly concave facets 150 to 250 km in diameter at about 400 km in diameter it is larger than the saturnian moon mimas which is fully ellipsoidal this difference may be due to a past collisional disruption of proteus the surface of proteus is heavily cratered and shows a number of linear features its largest crater pharos is more than 150 km in diameterall of neptunes inner moons are dark objects their geometric albedo ranges from 7 to 10 their spectra indicate that they are made from water ice contaminated by some very dark material probably complex organic compounds in this respect the inner neptunian moons are similar to the inner uranian moons


 irregular moons 

in order of their distance from the planet the irregular moons are triton nereid halimede sao laomedeia psamathe and neso a group that includes both prograde and retrograde objects the five outermost moons are similar to the irregular moons of other giant planets and are thought to have been gravitationally captured by neptune unlike the regular satellites which probably formed in situtriton and nereid are unusual irregular satellites and are thus treated separately from the other five irregular neptunian moons which are more like the outer irregular satellites of the other outer planets firstly they are the largest two known irregular moons in the solar system with triton being almost an order of magnitude larger than all other known irregular moons secondly they both have atypically small semi-major axes with tritons being over an order of magnitude smaller than those of all other known irregular moons thirdly they both have unusual orbital eccentricities nereid has one of the most eccentric orbits of any known irregular satellite and tritons orbit is a nearly perfect circle finally nereid also has the lowest inclination of any known irregular satellite


 triton 

triton follows a retrograde and quasi-circular orbit and is thought to be a gravitationally captured satellite it was the second moon in the solar system that was discovered to have a substantial atmosphere which is primarily nitrogen with small amounts of methane and carbon monoxide the pressure on tritons surface is about 14 μbar in 1989 the voyager 2 spacecraft observed what appeared to be clouds and hazes in this thin atmosphere triton is one of the coldest bodies in the solar system with a surface temperature of about 38 k −235.2 °c its surface is covered by nitrogen methane carbon dioxide and water ices and has a high geometric albedo of more than 70 the bond albedo is even higher reaching up to 90 surface features include the large southern polar cap older cratered planes cross-cut by graben and scarps as well as youthful features probably formed by endogenic processes like cryovolcanism voyager 2 observations revealed a number of active geysers within the polar cap heated by the sun which eject plumes to the height of up to 8 km triton has a relatively high density of about 2 gcm3 indicating that rocks constitute about two thirds of its mass and ices mainly water ice the remaining one third there may be a layer of liquid water deep inside triton forming a subterranean ocean because of its retrograde orbit and relative proximity to neptune closer than the moon is to earth tidal deceleration is causing triton to spiral inward which will lead to its destruction in about 3.6 billion years


 nereid 

nereid is the third-largest moon of neptune it has a prograde but very eccentric orbit and is believed to be a former regular satellite that was scattered to its current orbit through gravitational interactions during tritons capture water ice has been spectroscopically detected on its surface early measurements of nereid showed large irregular variations in its visible magnitude which were speculated to be caused by forced precession or chaotic rotation combined with an elongated shape and bright or dark spots on the surface this was disproved in 2016 when observations from the kepler space telescope showed only minor variations thermal modeling based on infrared observations from the spitzer and herschel space telescopes suggest that nereid is only moderately elongated which disfavours forced precession of the rotation the thermal model also indicates that the surface roughness of nereid is very high likely similar to the saturnian moon hyperion


 normal irregular moons 
among the remaining irregular moons sao and laomedeia follow prograde orbits whereas halimede psamathe and neso follow retrograde orbits given the similarity of their orbits it was suggested that neso and psamathe could have a common origin in the break-up of a larger moon psamathe and neso have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered in the solar system to date they take 25 years to orbit neptune at an average of 125 times the distance between earth and the moon neptune has the largest hill sphere in the solar system owing primarily to its large distance from the sun this allows it to retain control of such distant moons nevertheless jupiters s2003 j 2 orbits at the greatest percentage of the primarys hill radius of all the moons in the solar system on average and the jovian moons in the carme and pasiphae groups orbit at a greater percentage of their primarys hill radius than psamathe and neso


 formation 
the mass distribution of the neptunian moons is the most lopsided of the satellite systems of the giant planets in the solar system one moon triton makes up nearly all of the mass of the system with all other moons together comprising only one third of one percent this is similar to the moon system of saturn where titan makes up more than 95% of the total mass but is different from the more balanced systems of jupiter and uranus the reason for the lopsidedness of the present neptunian system is that triton was captured well after the formation of neptunes original satellite system much of which would have been destroyed in the process of capture

tritons orbit upon capture would have been highly eccentric and would have caused chaotic perturbations in the orbits of the original inner neptunian satellites causing them to collide and reduce to a disc of rubble this means it is likely that neptunes present inner satellites are not the original bodies that formed with neptune only after tritons orbit became circularised could some of the rubble re-accrete into the present-day regular moons this great perturbation may possibly be the reason why the satellite system of neptune does not follow the 10,0001 ratio of mass between the parent planet and all its moons seen in the satellite systems of all the other giant planetsthe mechanism of triton’s capture has been the subject of several theories over the years one of them postulates that triton was captured in a three-body encounter in this scenario triton is the surviving member of a binary kuiper belt object disrupted by its encounter with neptunenumerical simulations show that there is a 0.41 probability that the moon halimede collided with nereid at some time in the past although it is not known whether any collision has taken place both moons appear to have similar grey colors implying that halimede could be a fragment of nereid


 list 
the neptunian moons are listed here by orbital period from shortest to longest irregular captured moons are marked by color triton the only neptunian moon massive enough for its surface to have collapsed into a spheroid is emboldened
