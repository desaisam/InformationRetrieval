imperialism is policy or ideology of extending a nations rule over foreign nations often by military force or by gaining political and economic control of other areas it was common around the world throughout recorded history but diminishing in the late 20th century in recent times it has been considered morally reprehensible and prohibited by international law therefore the term is used in international propaganda to denounce an opponents foreign policythe term can be applied to the colonization of the americas between the 15th and 19th centuries as opposed to new imperialism which describes the expansion of western powers and japan during the late 19th and early 20th centuries however both are examples of imperialism


 etymology and usage 
the word imperialism originated from the latin word imperium which means supreme power it first became common with its current sense in great britain during the 1870s and was used with a negative connotation previously the word imperialism had been used to describe to what was perceived as napoleon iiis attempts of obtaining political support through foreign military interventions the term was and is mainly applied to western and japanese political and economic dominance especially in asia and africa in the 19th and 20th centuries its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars some writers such as edward said use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organised with an imperial center and a periphery this definition encompasses both nominal empires and neocolonialism


 colonialism versus imperialism 

the word empire comes from the latin word imperium for which the closest modern english equivalent would perhaps be sovereignty or simply rule the greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded political power grows from conquering land however cultural and economic aspects flourish through sea and trade routes  a distinction about empires is that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products european empires in asia and africa have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the european seaborne empires european expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory the two main regions are the core and the periphery the core consists of areas of high income and profit the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit these critical theories of geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world the russian leader lenin suggested that imperialism was the highest form of capitalism claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism this idea from lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations

the term imperialism is often conflated with colonialism however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe ones perceived superiority domination and influence upon a person or group of people robert young writes that while imperialism operates from the center is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions however colonialism still includes invasion colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power particularly edward said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating imperialism involved the practice the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory while colonialism refers to the implanting of settlements on a distant territory contiguous land empires such as the russian or ottoman have traditionally been excluded from discussions of colonialism though this is beginning to change since it is accepted that they also sent populations into the territories they ruledimperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance either formally or informally colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled colonialisms core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war the meaning of imperialism is to create an empire by conquering the other states lands and therefore increasing its own dominance colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region colonialism can completely change the existing social structure physical structure and economics of an area it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations few colonies remain remote from their mother country thus most will eventually establish a separate nationality or remain under complete control of their mother colony


 justification 

stephen howe has summarized the beneficial effects of the main empires

at least some of the great modern empires –  the british french austro-hungarian russian and even the ottoman – have virtues that have been too readily forgotten they provided stability security and legal order for their subjects  they constrained and at their best tried to transcend the potentially savage ethnic or religious antagonisms among the peoples and the aristocracies which ruled most of them were often far more liberal humane and cosmopolitan than their supposedly ever more democratic successors
a controversial aspect of imperialism is the defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds in ancient china tianxia denoted the lands space and area divinely appointed to the emperor by universal and well-defined principles of order the center of this land was directly apportioned to the imperial court forming the center of a world view that centered on the imperial court and went concentrically outward to major and minor officials and then the common citizens tributary states and finally ending with the fringe barbarians tianxias idea of hierarchy gave chinese a privileged position and was justified through the promise of order and peace j a hobson identifies this justification on general grounds as it is desirable that the earth should be peopled governed and developed as far as possible by the races which can do this work best ie by the races of highest social efficiency  many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons friedrich ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive imperialism was needed halford mackinder felt that great britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism the purportedly scientific nature of social darwinism and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism under this doctrine the french politician jules ferry could declare in 1883 that superior races have a right because they have a duty they have the duty to civilize the inferior races the rhetoric of colonizers being racially superior appears to have achieved its purpose for example throughout latin america whiteness is still prized today and various forms of blanqueamiento whitening are common
the royal geographical society of london and other geographical societies in europe had great influence and were able to fund travelers who would come back with tales of their discoveries these societies also served as a space for travellers to share these stories political geographers such as friedrich ratzel of germany and halford mackinder of britain also supported imperialism ratzel believed expansion was necessary for a states survival while mackinder supported britains imperial expansion these two arguments dominated the discipline for decadesgeographical theories such as environmental determinism also suggested that tropical environments created uncivilized people in need of european guidance for instance american geographer ellen churchill semple argued that even though human beings originated in the tropics they were only able to become fully human in the temperate zone tropicality can be paralleled with edward saids orientalism as the wests construction of the east as the other according to said orientalism allowed europe to establish itself as the superior and the norm which justified its dominance over the essentialized orienttechnology and economic efficiency were often improved in territories subjected to imperialism through the building of roads other infrastructure and introduction of new technologies
the principles of imperialism are often generalizable to the policies and practices of the british empire during the last generation and proceeds rather by diagnosis than by historical description british imperialism in some sparsely-inhabited regions appears to have applied a principle now termed terra nullius latin expression which stems from roman law meaning empty land the country of australia serves as a case study in relation to british settlement and colonial rule of the continent in the eighteenth century that was arguably premised on terra nullius as its settlers considered it unused by its original inhabitants


 orientalism and imaginative geography 
imperial control territorial and cultural is justified through discourses about the imperialists understanding of different spaces conceptually imagined geographies explain the limitations of the imperialist understanding of the societies human reality of the different spaces inhabited by the non–european otherin orientalism 1978 edward said said that the west developed the concept of the orient—an imagined geography of the eastern world—which functions as an essentializing discourse that represents neither the ethnic diversity nor the social reality of the eastern world that by reducing the east into cultural essences the imperial discourse uses place-based identities to create cultural difference and psychologic distance between we the west and they the east and between here in the west and there in the eastthat cultural differentiation was especially noticeable in the books and paintings of early oriental studies the european examinations of the orient which misrepresented the east as irrational and backward the opposite of the rational and progressive west defining the east as a negative vision of the western world as its inferior not only increased the sense-of-self of the west but also was a way of ordering the east and making it known to the west so that it could be dominated and controlled therefore orientalism was the ideological justification of early western imperialism—a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social cultural political and economic control of other non-white peoples


 cartography 

one of the main tools used by imperialists was cartography cartography is the art science and technology of making maps but this definition is problematic it implies that maps are objective representations of the world when in reality they serve very political means for harley maps serve as an example of foucaults power and knowledge concept
to better illustrate this idea bassett focuses his analysis of the role of nineteenth-century maps during the scramble for africa he states that maps contributed to empire by promoting assisting and legitimizing the extension of french and british power into west africa during his analysis of nineteenth-century cartographic techniques he highlights the use of blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory this provided incentives for imperial and colonial powers to obtain information to fill in blank spaces on contemporary mapsalthough cartographic processes advanced through imperialism further analysis of their progress reveals many biases linked to eurocentrism according to bassett nineteenth-century explorers commonly requested africans to sketch maps of unknown areas on the ground many of those maps were highly regarded for their accuracy but were not printed in europe unless europeans verified them

imperialism in ancient times is clear in the history of china and in the history of western asia and the mediterranean—an unending succession of empires the tyrannical empire of the assyrians was replaced 6th–4th century bce by that of the persians in strong contrast to the assyrian in its liberal treatment of subjected peoples assuring it long duration it eventually gave way to the imperialism of greece when greek imperialism reached an apex under alexander the great 356–323 bce a union of the eastern mediterranean with western asia was achieved but the cosmopolis in which all citizens of the world would live harmoniously together in equality remained a dream of alexander it was partially realized when the romans built their empire from britain to egypt
cultural imperialism is an extremely fuzzy concept pointing to the supposed influence of one dominant culture over others ie a form of soft power which changes the moral cultural and societal worldview of the subordinate country in some ways this is such an expansion of the concept of imperialism as to be meaningless this is more than just foreign music television or film becoming popular with young people but that popular culture changing their own expectations of life and their desire for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted for example depictions of opulent american lifestyles in the soap opera dallas during the cold war changed the expectations of romanians a more recent example is the influence of smuggled south korean drama series in north korea the importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc nor is such a usage of culture recent as part of roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of roman culture and lifestyle with the aim that they would then become willing participants
imperialism has been subject to moral or immoral censure by its critics and thus the term is frequently used in international propaganda as a pejorative for expansionist and aggressive foreign policy


 age of imperialism 

the age of imperialism a time period beginning around 1760 saw european industrializing nations engaging in the process of colonizing influencing and annexing other parts of the world  19th century episodes included  the scramble for africa

in the 1970s british historians john gallagher 1919–1980 and ronald robinson 1920–1999 argued that european leaders rejected the notion that imperialism required formal legal control by one government over a colonial region much more important was informal control of independent areas according to wm roger louis in their view historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red the bulk of british emigration trade and capital went to areas outside the formal british empire key to their thinking is the idea of empire informally if possible and formally if necessary  oron hale says that gallagher and robinson looked at the british involvement in africa where they found few capitalists less capital and not much pressure from the alleged traditional promoters of colonial expansion  cabinet decisions to annex or not to annex were made usually on the basis of political or geopolitical considerationslooking at the main empires from 1875–1914 historians estimate a mixed record in terms of profitability  at first planners expected that colonies would provide an excellent captive market for manufactured items  apart from india this was seldom true  by the 1890s imperialists saw the economic benefit primarily in the production of inexpensive raw materials to feed the domestic manufacturing sector  overall great britain did very well in terms of profits from india  but not from most of the rest of its empire  the netherlands did very well in the east indies germany and italy got very little trade or raw materials from their empires france did slightly better the belgian congo was notoriously profitable when it was a capitalistic rubber plantation owned and operated by king leopold ii as a private enterprise  however scandal after scandal regarding very badly mistreated labour led the international community to force the government of belgium to take it over in 1908 and it became much less profitable  the philippines cost the united states much more than expected because of military action against rebelsbecause of the resources made available by imperialism the worlds economy grew significantly and became much more interconnected in the decades before world war i making the many imperial powers rich and prosperouseuropes expansion into territorial imperialism was largely focused on economic growth by collecting resources from colonies in combination with assuming political control by military and political means the colonization of india in the mid-18th century offers an example of this focus there the british exploited the political weakness of the mughal state and while military activity was important at various times the economic and administrative incorporation of local elites was also of crucial significance for the establishment of control over the subcontinents resources markets and manpower although a substantial number of colonies had been designed to provide economic profit and to ship resources to home ports in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries fieldhousesuggests that in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in places such as africa and asia this idea is not necessarily valid

modern empires were not artificially constructed economic machines the second expansion of europe was a complex historical process in which political social and emotional forces in europe and on the periphery were more influential than calculated imperialism individual colonies might serve an economic purpose collectively no empire had any definable function economic or otherwise empires represented only a particular phase in the ever-changing relationship of europe with the rest of the world analogies with industrial systems or investment in real estate were simply misleading

during this time european merchants had the ability to roam the high seas and appropriate surpluses from around the world sometimes peaceably sometimes violently and to concentrate them in europe

european expansion greatly accelerated in the 19th century to obtain raw materials europe expanded imports from other countries and from the colonies european industrialists sought raw materials such as dyes cotton vegetable oils and metal ores from overseas concurrently industrialization was quickly making europe the center of manufacturing and economic growth driving resource needscommunication became much more advanced during european expansion with the invention of railroads and telegraphs it became easier to communicate with other countries and to extend the administrative control of a home nation over its colonies steam railroads and steam-driven ocean shipping made possible the fast cheap transport of massive amounts of goods to and from coloniesalong with advancements in communication europe also continued to advance in military technology european chemists made new explosives that made artillery much more deadly  by the 1880s the machine gun had become a reliable battlefield weapon this technology gave european armies an advantage over their opponents as armies in less-developed countries were still fighting with arrows swords and leather shields eg the zulus in southern africa during the anglo-zulu war of 1879


 theories of imperialism 
anglophone academic studies often base their theories regarding imperialism on the british experience of empire the term imperialism was originally introduced into english in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of british prime minister benjamin disraeli supporters of imperialism such as joseph chamberlain quickly appropriated the concept for some imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed
john a hobson a leading english liberal developed a highly influential interpretation of imperialism a study 1902 that expanded on his belief that free enterprise capitalism had a negative impact on the majority of the population  in imperialism he argued that the financing of overseas empires drained money that was needed at home  it was invested abroad because lower wages paid the workers overseas made for higher profits and higher rates of return compared to domestic wages  so although domestic wages remained higher they did not grow nearly as fast as they might have otherwise  exporting capital he concluded put a lid on the growth of domestic wages in the domestic standard of living   by the 1970s historians such as david k fieldhouse and oron hale could argue that the hobsonian foundation has been almost completely demolished  the british experience failed to support it  however european socialists picked up hobsons ideas and made it into their own theory of imperialism most notably in lenins imperialism the highest stage of capitalism 1916 lenin portrayed imperialism as the closure of the world market and the end of capitalist free-competition that arose from the need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion later marxist theoreticians echo this conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism which explained the world war as the battle between imperialists for control of external markets  lenins treatise became a standard textbook that flourished until the collapse of communism in 1989–91some theoreticians on the non-communist left have emphasized the structural or systemic character of imperialism such writers have expanded the period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century but a world system extending over a period of centuries often going back to christopher columbus and in some accounts to the crusades as the application of the term has expanded its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes the moral the economic the systemic the cultural and the temporal those changes reflect—among other shifts in sensibility—a growing unease even great distaste with the pervasiveness of such power specifically western powerhistorians and political theorists have long debated the correlation between capitalism class and imperialism much of the debate was pioneered by such theorists as j a hobson 1858–1940 joseph schumpeter 1883–1950 thorstein veblen 1857–1929 and norman angell 1872–1967 while these non-marxist writers were at their most prolific before world war i they remained active in the interwar years their combined work informed the study of imperialism and its impact on europe as well as contributing to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the united states from the 1950s hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption create wealth and encourage a peaceful tolerant multipolar world orderwalter rodney in his 1972 classic how europe underdeveloped africa proposes the idea that imperialism is a phase of capitalism in which western european capitalist countries the us and japan established political economic military and cultural hegemony over other parts of the world which were initially at a lower level and therefore could not resist domination as a result imperialism for many years embraced the whole world – one part being the exploiters and the other the exploited one part being dominated and the other acting as overlords one part making policy and the other being dependent


 environmental determinism 
the concept of environmental determinism served as a moral justification for the domination of certain territories and peoples the environmental determinist school of thought held that the environment in which certain people lived determined those persons behaviours and this validated their domination for example the western world saw people living in tropical environments as less civilized therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission across the three major waves of european colonialism the first in the americas the second in asia and the last in africa environmental determinism served to place categorically indigenous people in a racial hierarchy this takes two forms orientalism and tropicality
some geographic scholars under colonizing empires divided the world into climatic zones these scholars believed that northern europe and the mid-atlantic temperate climate produced a hard-working moral and upstanding human being in contrast tropical climates allegedly yielded lazy attitudes sexual promiscuity exotic culture and moral degeneracy the people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from a european empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure they were seen as incapable of such a feat similarly orientalism could promote a view of a people based on their geographical location


 imperialism by country 


 britain 

britains imperialist ambitions can be seen as early as the sixteenth century in 1599 the british east india company was established and was chartered by queen elizabeth in the following year with the establishment of trading posts in india the british were able to maintain strength relative to other empires such as the portuguese who already had set up trading posts in india in 1767 political activity caused exploitation of the east india company causing the plundering of the local economy almost bringing the company into bankruptcy by the year 1670 britains imperialist ambitions were well off as she had colonies in virginia massachusetts bermuda honduras antigua barbados jamaica and nova scotiadue to the vast imperialist ambitions of european countries britain had several clashes with france this competition was evident in the colonization of what is now known as canada john cabot claimed newfoundland for the british while the french established colonies along the st lawrence river and claiming it as new france britain continued to expand by colonizing countries such as new zealand and australia both of which were not empty land as they had their own locals and cultures britains nationalistic movements were evident with the creation of the commonwealth countries where there was a shared nature of national identitythe first british empire was based on mercantilism and involved colonies and holdings primarily in north america the caribbean and india its growth was reversed by the loss of the american colonies in 1776 britain made compensating gains in india australia and in constructing an informal economic empire through control of trade and finance in latin america after the independence of spanish and portuguese colonies in about 1820  by the 1840s britain had adopted a highly successful policy of free trade that gave it dominance in the trade of much of the world after losing its first empire to the americans britain then turned its attention towards asia africa and the pacific following the defeat of napoleonic france in 1815 britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial holdings around the globe unchallenged at sea british dominance was later described as pax britannica british peace a period of relative peace in europe and the world 1815–1914 during which the british empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman

in the early 19th century the industrial revolution began to transform britain by the time of the great exhibition in 1851 the country was described as the workshop of the world the british empire expanded to include india large parts of africa and many other territories throughout the world alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies british dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions such as asia and latin america domestically political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise during this century the population increased at a dramatic rate accompanied by rapid urbanisation causing significant social and economic stresses to seek new markets and sources of raw materials the conservative party under disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in egypt south africa and elsewhere canada australia and new zealand became self-governing dominionsa resurgence came in the late 19th century with the scramble for africa and major additions in asia and the middle east the british spirit of imperialism was expressed by joseph chamberlain and lord rosebury and implemented in africa by cecil rhodes the pseudo-sciences of social darwinism and theories of race formed an ideological underpinning during this time other influential spokesmen included lord cromer lord curzon general kitchener lord milner and the writer rudyard kipling the british empire was the largest empire that the world has ever seen both in terms of landmass and population its power both military and economic remained unmatched after the first boer war the south african republic and orange free state were recognized by britain but eventually re-annexed after the second boer war
world war ii had weakened britains position in the world especially financially decolonization movements proliferated throughout the cold war resulting in indian independence and the establishment of independent states throughout africa british imperialism continued for a few years notably with its involvement in the iranian coup détat of 1953 and in egypt during the suez crisis in 1956 however with the united states and soviet union emerging from world war ii as the sole superpowers britains role as a worldwide power declined significantly


 china 

ancient china has been one of the worlds oldest empires that still exist due to its long history of being imperialist expansion china has been seen by its neighboring countries as a threat due to large population giant economy large military force as well as its territorial evolution in most of history of china
starting with the unification of china under the qin dynasty later chinese dynasties continued to follow its form of expansions the most successful chinese imperial dynasties are tang and qing dynasty due to its expansions


 france 

during the 16th century the french colonization of the americas began with the creation of new france it was followed by french east india companys trading posts in africa and asia in the 17th century france had its first colonial empire from 1534 until 1814 including new france canada acadia newfoundland and louisiana french west indies saint-domingue guadeloupe martinique french guiana senegal gorée mascarene islands mauritius island réunion and french india
its second colonial empire began with the conquest of algiers in 1830 and came for the most part to an end with the granting of independence to algeria in 1962 the french imperial history was marked by numerous wars large and small and also by significant help to france itself from the colonials in the world wars france took control of algeria in 1830 but began in earnest to rebuild its worldwide empire after 1850 concentrating chiefly in north and west africa french north africa french west africa french equatorial africa as well as south-east asia french indochina with other conquests in the south pacific new caledonia french polynesia

french republicans at first hostile to empire only became supportive when germany started to build her own colonial empire as it developed the new empire took on roles of trade with france supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items as well as lending prestige to the motherland and spreading french civilization and language as well as catholicism it also provided crucial manpower in both world wars it became a moral justification to lift the world up to french standards by bringing christianity and french culture in 1884 the leading exponent of colonialism jules ferry declared france had a civilising mission the higher races have a right over the lower races they have a duty to civilize the inferior  full citizenship rights – assimilation – were offered although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon contrasting from britain france sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies with the only notable exception of algeria where french settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority
in the 19th and 20th centuries the french colonial empire was the second-largest colonial empire in the world behind the british empire extending over 12,347,000 km2 4,767,000 sq miles at its height in the 1920s and 1930s france controlled nearly 1/10th of the earths land area with a population of 110 million people on the eve of world war ii 5% of the worlds population at the timein world war ii charles de gaulle and the free french used the overseas colonies as bases from which they fought to liberate france however after 1945 anti-colonial movements began to challenge the empire france fought and lost a bitter war in vietnam in the 1950s whereas they won the war in algeria de gaulle decided to grant algeria independence anyway in 1962 french settlers and many local supporters relocated to france nearly all of frances colonies gained independence by 1960 but france retained great financial and diplomatic influence it has repeatedly sent troops to assist its former colonies in africa in suppressing insurrections and coups détat


 germany 

german  participation in imperialism was negligible until the late 19th century  prussia unified the other states into the second german empire in 1871 its chancellor otto von bismarck 1862–90 long opposed colonial acquisitions arguing that the burden of obtaining maintaining and defending such possessions would outweigh any potential benefits he felt that colonies did not pay for themselves that the german bureaucratic system would not work well in the tropics and the diplomatic disputes over colonies would distract germany from its central interest europe itselfhowever public opinion and elite opinion in germany demanded colonies for reasons of international prestige so bismarck was forced to oblige in 1883–84 germany began to build a colonial empire in africa and the south pacific  the establishment of the german colonial empire started with german new guinea in 1884german colonies included the present territories of in africa tanzania rwanda burundi namibia cameroon ghana and togo in oceania new guinea solomon islands nauru marshall islands mariana islands caroline islands and samoa and in asia tsingtao chefoo and the jiaozhou bay
by the treaty of versailles all german colonies were lost after world war i


 japan 

for over 200 years japan remained isolated from the rest of the world staying in a feudal system however in the 1850s military pressure by the united states and other world powers forced japan to open itself to the world markets ending the period of isolation a period of conflicts and revolutions unleashed in the uncertainty of the new period ending in 1867 with the reunification of the political power in only one leader the japanese emperor everything was ready for japan to embrace the industrial revolution however from the start the japanese didnt look too enthusiastic on relying on other countries to obtain industrial manufactures and remaining forever an underdeveloped nation key to this understanding is the traditional japanese psyche of self-sustainability that made them survive isolated for centuries thus japan initiated a process of modernization through central planning and a firm direction of the government this became one of the fastest modernization processes in world history in a matter of few decades it went through the full technological evolution that took centuries in europe japans late industrialization example became a leading case for underdeveloped countries that suffered from european rule by the early 1900s japan was a naval power that could hold its own against an established european power like russia
without much natural resources and territory to sustain the increasing japanese population that industrialization brought japan turned to imperialism and expansionism as a way to compensate for its lackings and also to strengthen itself the national motto fukoku kyōhei 富国強兵 enrich the state strengthen the military as a sign of this attitude also the mentioned typical self-sustaining mentality of the japanese was a cause of this change in foreign policy
and japan was eager to take every opportunity in 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the republic of ezo to incorporate definitely the island of hokkaido to japan for centuries japan viewed the ryukyu islands as one of its provinces in 1871 the mudan incident happened cannibal taiwanese aborigines murdered 54 ryūkyūan sailors that had their ship shipwrecked at that time the ryukyu islands were claimed by both qing china and japan and the japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens they took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction in 1872 the japanese ryukyu domain was declared and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to taiwan was sent which was a success the success of this expedition emboldened the japanese not even the americans could defeat the taiwanese cannibals in the formosa expedition of 1867 very few gave it much thought at the time but this was the first move in the japanese expansionism series japan occupied taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to chinese pressures but in 1879 it finally annexed the ryukyu islands in 1875 qing china sent a 300-men force to subdue the taiwanese cannibals but unlike the japanese the chinese were routed ambushed and 250 of their men were killed the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of qing china to exert effective control in taiwan and acted as another incentive for the japanese to annex taiwan eventually the spoils for winning the first sino-japanese war in 1894 included taiwan
in 1875 japan took its first operation against joseon korea another territory that for centuries it coveted the ganghwa island incident made korea open to international trade korea was annexed in 1910 as a result of winning the russo-japanese war in 1905 japan took part of sakhalin island from russia precisely the victory against the russian empire shook the world never before an asian nation defeated a european power and in japan it was seen as a feat japans victory against russia would act as an antecedent for asian countries in the fight against the western powers for decolonization during world war i japan took german-leased territories in chinas shandong province as well as the mariana caroline and marshall islands and kept the islands as league of nations mandates at first japan was in good standing with the victorious allied powers of world war i but different discrepancies and dissatisfaction with the rewards of the treaties cooled the relations with them for example american pressure forced it to return the shandong area by the 30s economic depression urgency of resources and a growing distrust in the allied powers made japan lean to a hardened militaristic stance through the decade it would grow closer to germany and italy forming together the axis alliance in 1931 japan took manchuria from china international reactions condemned this move but japans already strong skepticism against allied nations meant that it nevertheless carried on

during the second sino-japanese war in 1937 japans military invaded central china by now relations with the allied powers were at the bottom and an international boycott against japan to deprive it of natural resources was enforced thus a military move to gain access to them was needed and so japan attacked pearl harbor bringing the united states to world war ii using its superior technological advances in naval aviation and its modern doctrines of amphibious and naval warfare japan achieved one of the fastest maritime expansions in history by the end of the pacific war japan had conquered much of east asia and the pacific including the east of china hong kong thailand vietnam cambodia myanmar malaysia singapore the philippines indonesia part of new guinea and many islands of the pacific ocean just as japans late industrialization success and victory against the russian empire was seen as an example among underdeveloped asia-pacific nations the japanese took advantage of this and promoted among its conquered the goal to jointly create an anti-european greater east asia co-prosperity sphere this plan helped the japanese gain support from native populations during its conquests however the united states were benefited by the long-term war of attrition and over time the massive output of their industrial muscle together with improvements in their military doctrines turned the war in their favor japans defeat in 1945 meant that its imperial gains along with the proposed pan-asian sphere were lost altogether but this anti-european experience was one of the leading antecedents in the decolonization movements in east asia and the pacific in the second half of the 20th century

the ottoman empire was an imperial state that lasted from 1299 to 1922 in 1453 mehmed the conqueror besieged the capital of the byzantine empire resulting in the fall of constantinople after 1,500 years of roman rule thereafter making it the capital of the empire during the 16th and 17th centuries in particular at the height of its power under the reign of suleiman the magnificent the ottoman empire was a powerful multinational multilingual empire which invaded and colonized much of southeast europe western asia the caucasus north africa and the horn of africa its repeated invasions and brutal treatment of slavs led to the great migration of the serbs to escape persecution at the beginning of the 17th century the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states some of these were later absorbed into the empire while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centurieswith constantinople as its capital and control of lands around the mediterranean basin the ottoman empire was at the center of interactions between the eastern and western worlds for six centuries following a long period of military setbacks against european powers the ottoman empire gradually declined in its ability to remain sovereign against competing powers in the late nineteenth century the empire allied with germany in the early 20th century with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories but it dissolved in the aftermath of its defeat in the first world war the residue was the new state of turkey in the ottoman anatolian heartland as well as the creation of modern balkan and middle eastern states thus ending turkish colonial ambitions


 imperial russia and the soviet union 

by the 18th century the russian empire extended its control to the pacific forming a common border with the qing empire this took place in a large number of military invasions of the lands east west and south of it the polish–russian war of 1792 took place after polish nobility from the polish–lithuanian commonwealth wrote the constitution of may 3 1791 the war resulted in eastern poland being conquered by imperial russia as a colony until 1918 the southern campaigns involved a series of russo-persian wars which began with the persian expedition of 1796 resulting in the acquisition of georgia country as a protectorate between 1800 and 1864 imperial armies invaded south in the russian conquest of the caucasus the murid war and the russo-circassian war this last conflict led to the ethnic cleansing of circassians from their lands the russian conquest of siberia over the khanate of sibir took place in the 16th and 17th centuries and resulted in the slaughter of various indigenous tribes by russians including the daur the koryaks the itelmens mansi people and the chukchi the russian colonization of central and eastern europe and siberia and treatment of the resident indigenous peoples has been compared to european colonization of the americas with similar negative impacts on the indigenous siberians as upon the indigenous peoples of the americas the extermination of indigenous siberian tribes was so complete that a relatively small population of only 180,000 are said to exist today the russian empire exploited and suppressed cossacks hosts during this period before turning them into the special military estate sosloviye in the late 18th century cossacks were then used in imperial russian campaigns against other tribesbolshevik leaders had effectively reestablished a polity with roughly the same extent as that empire by 1921 however with an internationalist ideology lenin in particular asserted the right to limited self-determination for national minorities within the new territory beginning in 1923 the policy of indigenization korenizatsiya was intended to support non-russians develop their national cultures within a socialist framework never formally revoked it stopped being implemented after 1932 after world war ii the soviet union installed socialist regimes modeled on those it had installed in 1919–20 in the old russian empire in areas its forces occupied in eastern europe the soviet union and the peoples republic of china supported post–world war ii communist movements in foreign nations and colonies to advance their own interests but were not always successfultrotsky and others believed that the revolution could only succeed in russia as part of a world revolution lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism however after lenins death joseph stalin established socialism in one country for the soviet union creating the model for subsequent inward looking stalinist states and purging the early internationalist elements the internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the americans during the cold war in the after stalin period in the late 1950s the new political leader nikita khrushchev put pressure on the soviet-american relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda in his speech on the un conference in 1960 he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders although the soviet union declared itself anti-imperialist critics argue that it exhibited traits common to historic empires some scholars hold that the soviet union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states some also argued that the ussr practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old russian tradition of expansion and control mao zedong once argued that the soviet union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade moreover the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government some marxists within the russian federation and later the ussr like sultan galiev and vasyl shakhrai considered the soviet regime a renewed version of the russian imperialism and colonialism


 united states 

a former colony itself the early united states expressed its opposition to imperialism at least in a form distinct from its own manifest destiny through policies such as the monroe doctrine however beginning in the late 19th and early 20th century policies such as theodore roosevelt’s interventionism in central america and woodrow wilson’s mission to make the world safe for democracy changed all this they were often backed by military force but were more often effected from behind the scenes this is consistent with the general notion of hegemony and imperium of historical empires in 1898 americans who opposed imperialism created the anti-imperialist league to oppose the us annexation of the philippines and cuba one year later a war erupted in the philippines causing business labor and government leaders in the us to condemn americas occupation in the philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many filipinos american foreign policy was denounced as a racket by smedley butler a former american general who had become a spokesman for the far leftat the start of world war ii president franklin d roosevelt was opposed to european colonialism especially in india he pulled back when britains winston churchill demanded that victory in the war be the first priority roosevelt expected that the united nations would take up the problem of decolonizationsome have described the internal strife between various people groups as a form of imperialism or colonialism this internal form is distinct from informal us imperialism in the form of political and financial hegemony this internal form of imperialism is also distinct from the united states formation of colonies abroad  through the treatment of its indigenous peoples during westward expansion the united states took on the form of an imperial power prior to any attempts at external imperialism this internal form of empire has been referred to as internal colonialism  participation in the african slave trade and the subsequent treatment of its 12 to 15 million africans is viewed by some to be a more modern extension of americas internal colonialism  however this internal colonialism faced resistance as external colonialism did but the anti-colonial presence was far less prominent due to the nearly complete dominance that the united states was able to assert over both indigenous peoples and african-americans in his lecture on april 16 2003 edward said made a bold statement on modern imperialism in the united states whom he described as using aggressive means of attack towards the contemporary orient due to their backward living lack of democracy and the violation of women’s rights the western world forgets during this process of converting the other that enlightenment and democracy are concepts that not all will agree upon


 spain 
spanish imperialism in the colonial era corresponds with the rise and decline of the spanish empire conventionally recognized as emerging in 1402 with the conquest of the canary islands following the successes of exploratory maritime voyages conducted during the age of discovery such as those undertaken by christopher columbus spain committed considerable financial and military resources towards developing a robust navy capable of conducting large-scale transatlantic expeditionary operations in order to establish and solidify a firm imperial presence across portions of north america south america and the geographic regions comprising the caribbean basin concomitant with spanish endorsement and sponsorship of transatlantic expeditionary voyages was the deployment of conquistadors which further expanded spanish imperial boundaries through the acquisition and development of territories and colonies


 imperialism in the caribbean basin 

in congruence with the colonialist activities of competing european imperial powers throughout the 15th – 19th centuries the spanish were equally engrossed in extending geopolitical power the caribbean basin functioned as a key geographic focal point for advancing spanish imperialism similar to the strategic prioritization spain placed towards achieving victory in the conquests of the aztec empire and inca empire spain placed equal strategic emphasis on expanding the nations imperial footprint within the caribbean basin
echoing the prevailing ideological perspectives regarding colonialism and imperialism embraced by spains european rivals during the colonial era including the english french and the dutch the spanish utilized colonialism as a means of expanding imperial geopolitical borders and securing the defense of maritime trade routes in the caribbean basin
while leveraging colonialism in the same geographic operating theater as its imperial rivals spain maintained distinct imperial objectives and instituted a unique form of colonialism in support of its imperial agenda spain placed significant strategic emphasis on the acquisition extraction and exportation of precious metals primarily gold and silver a second objective was the evangelization of subjugated indigenous populations residing in mineral-rich and strategically favorable locations notable examples of these indigenous groups include the taίno populations inhabiting puerto rico and segments of cuba compulsory labor and slavery were widely institutionalized across spanish-occupied territories and colonies with an initial emphasis on directing labor towards mining activity and related methods of procuring semi-precious metals the emergence of the encomienda system during the 16th–17th centuries in occupied colonies within the caribbean basin reflects a gradual shift in imperial prioritization increasingly focusing on large-scale production and exportation of agricultural commodities


 scholarly debate and controversy 
the scope and scale of spanish participation in imperialism within the caribbean basin remains a subject of scholarly debate among historians a fundamental source of contention stems from the inadvertent conflation of theoretical conceptions of imperialism and colonialism furthermore significant variation exists in the definition and interpretation of these terms as expounded by historians anthropologists philosophers and political scientists
among historians there is substantial support in favor of approaching imperialism as a conceptual theory emerging during the 18th – 19th centuries particularly within britain propagated by key exponents such as joseph chamberlain and benjamin disraeli in accordance with this theoretical perspective the activities of the spanish in the caribbean are not components of a preeminent ideologically-driven form of imperialism rather these activities are more accurately classified as representing a form of colonialism
further divergence among historians can be attributed to varying theoretical perspectives regarding imperialism that are proposed by emerging academic schools of thought noteworthy examples include cultural imperialism whereby proponents such as john downing and annabelle sreberny-modammadi define imperialism as the conquest and control of one country by a more powerful one cultural imperialism signifies the dimensions of the process that go beyond economic exploitation or military force moreover colonialism is understood as the form of imperialism in which the government of the colony is run directly by foreignersin spite of diverging perspectives and the absence of a unilateral scholarly consensus regarding imperialism among historians within the context of spanish expansion in the caribbean basin during the colonial era imperialism can be interpreted as an overarching ideological agenda that is perpetuated through the institution of colonialism in this context colonialism functions as an instrument designed to achieve specific imperialist objectives
