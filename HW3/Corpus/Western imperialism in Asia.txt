western imperialism in asia as presented in this article pertains to western european
entry
into what was first called the east indies this was sparked early in the 15th century by the search for trade routes to china that led directly to the age of discovery and the introduction of early modern warfare into what was then called the far east by the early 16th century the age of sail greatly expanded western european influence and development of the spice trade under colonialism there has been a presence of western european colonial empires and imperialism in asia throughout six centuries of colonialism formally ending with the independence of the portuguese empires last colony east timor in 2002 the empires introduced western concepts of nation and the multinational state this article attempts to outline the consequent development of the western concept of the nation state
the thrust of european political power commerce and culture in asia gave rise to growing trade in commodities—a key development in the rise of todays modern world free market economy in the 16th century the portuguese broke the overland monopoly of the arabs and italians of trade between asia and europe by the discovery of the sea route to india around the cape of good hope with the ensuing rise of the rival dutch east india company portuguese influence in asia was gradually eclipsed dutch forces first established independent bases in the east most significantly batavia the heavily fortified headquarters of the dutch east india company and then between 1640 and 1660 wrestled malacca ceylon some southern indian ports and the lucrative japan trade from the portuguese later the english and the french established settlements in india and established a trade with china and their own acquisitions would gradually surpass those of the dutch following the end of the seven years war in 1763 the british eliminated french influence in india and established the british east india company as the most important political force on the indian subcontinent
before the industrial revolution in the mid-to-late 19th century demand for oriental goods such as porcelain silk spices and tea remained the driving force behind european imperialism and with the important exception of british east india company rule in india the western european stake in asia remained confined largely to trading stations and strategic outposts necessary to protect trade industrialisation however dramatically increased european demand for asian raw materials and the severe long depression of the 1870s provoked a scramble for new markets for european industrial products and financial services in africa the americas eastern europe and especially in asia this scramble coincided with a new era in global colonial expansion known as the new imperialism which saw a shift in focus from trade and indirect rule to formal colonial control of vast overseas territories ruled as political extensions of their mother countries between the 1870s and the beginning of world war i in 1914 the united kingdom france and the netherlands—the established colonial powers in asia—added to their empires vast expanses of territory in the middle east the indian subcontinent and south east asia in the same period the empire of japan following the meiji restoration the german empire following the end of the franco-prussian war in 1871 tsarist russia and the united states following the spanish–american war in 1898 quickly emerged as new imperial powers in east asia and in the pacific ocean area
in asia world war i and world war ii were played out as struggles among several key imperial powers—conflicts involving the european powers along with russia and the rising american and japanese powers none of the colonial powers however possessed the resources to withstand the strains of both world wars and maintain their direct rule in asia although nationalist movements throughout the colonial world led to the political independence of nearly all of the asias remaining colonies decolonisation was intercepted by the cold war and south east asia south asia the middle east and east asia remained embedded in a world economic financial and military system in which the great powers compete to extend their influence however the rapid post-war economic development and rise of the east asian tiger industrialized developed countries of taiwan singapore south korea japan and the developing countries of india the peoples republic of china and its developed industrialized territory of hong kong along with the collapse of the soviet union have effectively eliminated western european and american influence in asia with the peoples republic of china as superpowers


 early european exploration of asia 
european exploration of asia started in ancient roman times along the silk road knowledge of lands as distant as china were held by the romans trade with india through the roman egyptian red sea ports was significant in the first centuries of the common era


 medieval european exploration of asia 

in the 13th and 14th centuries a number of europeans many of them christian missionaries had sought to penetrate into china the most famous of these travelers was marco polo but these journeys had little permanent effect on east-west trade because of a series of political developments in asia in the last decades of the 14th century which put an end to further european exploration of asia the yuan dynasty in china which had been receptive to european missionaries and merchants was overthrown and the new ming rulers were found to be unreceptive of religious proselytism meanwhile the turks consolidated control over the eastern mediterranean closing off key overland trade routes thus until the 15th century only minor trade and cultural exchanges between europe and asia continued at certain terminals controlled by muslim traders


 oceanic voyages to asia 
western european rulers determined to find new trade routes of their own the portuguese spearheaded the drive to find oceanic routes that would provide cheaper and easier access to south and east asian goods this chartering of oceanic routes between east and west began with the unprecedented voyages of portuguese and spanish sea captains their voyages were influenced by medieval european adventurers who had journeyed overland to the far east and contributed to geographical knowledge of parts of asia upon their return
in 1488 bartolomeu dias rounded the southern tip of africa under the sponsorship of portugals john ii from which point he noticed that the coast swung northeast cape of good hope while dias crew forced him to turn back by 1497 portuguese navigator vasco da gama made the first open voyage from europe to india in 1520 ferdinand magellan a portuguese navigator in the service of the crown of castile spain found a sea route into the pacific ocean


 portuguese and spanish trade and colonization in asia 


 portuguese monopoly over trade in the indian ocean and asia 

in 1509 the portuguese under francisco de almeida won the decisive battle of diu against a joint mamluk and arab fleet sent to expel the portuguese of the arabian sea the victory enabled portugal to implement its strategy of controlling the indian ocean
early in the 16th century afonso de albuquerque left emerged as the portuguese colonial viceroy most instrumental in consolidating portugals holdings in africa and in asia he understood that portugal could wrest commercial supremacy from the arabs only by force and therefore devised a plan to establish forts at strategic sites which would dominate the trade routes and also protect portuguese interests on land in 1510 he conquered goa in india which enabled him to gradually consolidate control of most of the commercial traffic between europe and asia largely through trade europeans started to carry on trade from forts acting as foreign merchants rather than as settlers in contrast early european expansion in the west indies later known to europeans as a separate continent from asia that they would call the americas following the 1492 voyage of christopher columbus involved heavy settlement in colonies that were treated as political extensions of the mother countries
lured by the potential of high profits from another expedition the portuguese established a permanent base in cochin south of the indian trade port of calicut in the early 16th century in 1510 the portuguese led by afonso de albuquerque seized goa on the coast of india which portugal held until 1961 along with diu and daman the remaining territory and enclaves in india from a former network of coastal towns and smaller fortified trading ports added and abandoned or lost centuries before the portuguese soon acquired a monopoly over trade in the indian ocean
portuguese viceroy albuquerque 1509–1515 resolved to consolidate portuguese holdings in africa and asia and secure control of trade with the east indies and china his first objective was malacca which controlled the narrow strait through which most far eastern trade moved captured in 1511 malacca became the springboard for further eastward penetration starting with the voyage of antónio de abreu and francisco serrão in 1512 ordered by albuquerque to the moluccas years later the first trading posts were established in the moluccas or spice islands which was the source for some of the worlds most hotly demanded spices and from there in makassar and some others but smaller in the lesser sunda islands by 1513-1516 the first portuguese ships had reached canton on the southern coasts of china

in 1513 after the failed attempt to conquer aden albuquerque entered with an armada for the first time for europeans by the ocean via on the red sea and in 1515 albuquerque consolidated the portuguese hegemony in the persian gulf gates already begun by him in 1507 with the domain of muscat and ormuz shortly after other fortified bases and forts were annexed and built along the gulf and in 1521 through a military campaign the portuguese annexed bahrain
the portuguese conquest of malacca triggered the malayan–portuguese war in 1521 ming dynasty china defeated the portuguese at the battle of tunmen and then defeated the portuguese again at the battle of xicaowan the portuguese tried to establish trade with china by illegally smuggling with the pirates on the offshore islands off the coast of zhejiang and fujian but they were driven away by the ming navy in the 1530s-1540s
in 1557 china decided to lease macau to the portuguese as a place where they could dry goods they transported on their ships which they held until 1999 the portuguese based at goa and malacca had now established a lucrative maritime empire in the indian ocean meant to monopolise the spice trade the portuguese also began a channel of trade with the japanese becoming the first recorded westerners to have visited japan this contact introduced christianity and fire-arms into japan
in 1505 also possibly before in 1501 the portuguese through lourenço de almeida the son of francisco de almeida reached ceylon the portuguese founded a fort at the city of colombo in 1517 and gradually extended their control over the coastal areas and inland in a series of military conflicts and political manoeuvres the portuguese extended their control over the sinhalese kingdoms including jaffna 1591 raigama 1593 sitawaka 1593 and kotte 1594- however the aim of unifying the entire island under portuguese control faced the kingdom of kandys fierce resistance the portuguese led by pedro lopes de sousa launched a full-scale military invasion of the kingdom of kandy in the campaign of danture of 1594 the invasion was a disaster for the portuguese with their entire army wiped out by kandyan guerilla warfare constantino de sá romantically celebrated in the 17th century sinhalese epic also for its greater humanism and tolerance compared to other governors led the last military operation that also ended in disaster he died in the battle of randeniwela refusing to abandon his troops in the face of total annihilationthe energies of castile later the unified spain the other major colonial power of the 16th century were largely concentrated on the americas not south and east asia but the spanish did establish a footing in the far east in the philippines after fighting with the portuguese by the spice islands since 1522 and the agreement between the two powers in 1529 in the treaty of zaragoza the spanish led by miguel lópez de legazpi settled and conquered gradually the philippines since 1564 after the discovery of the return voyage to the americas by andres de urdaneta in 1565 cargoes of chinese goods were transported from the philippines to mexico and from there to spain by this long route spain reaped some of the profits of far eastern commerce spanish officials converted the islands to christianity and established some settlements permanently establishing the philippines as the area of east asia most oriented toward the west in terms of culture and commerce the moro muslims fought against the spanish for over three centuries in the spanish–moro conflict


 decline of portugals asian empire since the 17th century 
the lucrative trade was vastly expanded when the portuguese began to export slaves from africa in 1541 however over time the rise of the slave trade left portugal over-extended and vulnerable to competition from other western european powers envious of portugals control of trade routes other western european nations—mainly the netherlands france and england—began to send in rival expeditions to asia in 1642 the dutch drove the portuguese out of the gold coast in africa the source of the bulk of portuguese slave labourers leaving this rich slaving area to other europeans especially the dutch and the english
rival european powers began to make inroads in asia as the portuguese and spanish trade in the indian ocean declined primarily because they had become hugely over-stretched financially due to the limitations on their investment capacity and contemporary naval technology both of these factors worked in tandem making control over indian ocean trade extremely expensive
the existing portuguese interests in asia proved sufficient to finance further colonial expansion and entrenchment in areas regarded as of greater strategic importance in africa and brazil portuguese maritime supremacy was lost to the dutch in the 17th century and with this came serious challenges for the portuguese however they still clung to macau and settled a new colony on the island of timor it was as recent as the 1960s and 1970s that the portuguese began to relinquish their colonies in asia goa was invaded by india in 1961 and became an indian state in 1987 portuguese timor was abandoned in 1975 and was then invaded by indonesia it became an independent country in 2002 and macau was handed back to the chinese as per a treaty in 1999


 holy wars 
the arrival of the portuguese and spanish and their holy wars against muslim states in the malayan–portuguese war spanish–moro conflict and castilian war inflamed religious tensions and turned southeast asia into an arena of conflict between muslims and christians the brunei sultanates capital at kota batu was assaulted by governor sande who led the 1578 spanish attackthe word savages in spanish cafres was from the word infidel in arabic - kafir and was used by the spanish to refer to their own christian savages who were arrested in brunei it was said castilians are kafir men who have no souls who are condemned by fire when they die and that too because they eat pork by the brunei sultan after the term accursed doctrine was used to attack islam by the spaniards which fed into hatred between muslims and christians sparked by their 1571 war against brunei the sultans words were in response to insults coming from the spanish at manila in 1578 other muslims from champa java borneo luzon pahang demak aceh and the malays echoed the rhetoric of holy war against the spanish and iberian portuguese calling them kafir enemies which was a contrast to their earlier nuanced views of the portuguese in the hikayat tanah hitu and sejarah melayu the war by spain against brunei was defended in an apologia written by doctor de sande the british eventually partitioned and took over brunei while sulu was attacked by the british americans and spanish which caused its breakdown and downfall after both of them thrived from 1500-1900 for four centuries dar al-islam was seen as under invasion by kafirs by the atjehnese led by zayn al-din and by muslims in the philippines as they saw the spanish invasion since the spanish brought the idea of a crusader holy war against muslim moros just as the portuguese did in indonesia and india against what they called moors in their political and commercial conquests which they saw through the lens of religion in the 16th centuryin 1578 an attack was launched by the spanish against jolo and in 1875 it was destroyed at their hands and once again in 1974 it was destroyed by the philippines the spanish first set foot on borneo in bruneithe spanish war against brunei failed to conquer brunei but it totally cut off the philippines from bruneis influence the spanish then started colonizing mindanao and building fortresses in response the bisayas where spanish forces were stationed were subjected to retaliatory attacks by the magindanao in 1599-1600 due to the spanish attacks on mindanaothe brunei royal family was related to the muslim rajahs who in ruled the principality in 1570 of manila kingdom of maynila and this was what the spaniards came across on their initial arrival to manila spain uprooted islam out of areas where it was shallow after they began to force christianity on the philippines in their conquests after 1521 while islam was already widespread in the 16th century philippines in the philippines in the cebu islands the natives killed the spanish fleet leader magellan borneos western coastal areas at landak sukadana and sambas saw the growth of muslim states in the sixteenth century in the 15th century at nanking the capital of china the death and burial of the borneo bruneian king maharaja kama took place upon his visit to china with zheng hes fleetthe spanish were expelled from brunei in 1579 after they attacked in 1578 there were half a hundred thousand inhabitants before the 1597 attack by the spanish in bruneiduring first contact with china numerous aggressions and provocations were undertaken by the portuguese they believed they could mistreat the non-christians because they themselves were christians and acted in the name of their religion in committing crimes and atrocities this resulted in the battle of xicaowan where the local chinese navy defeated and captured a fleet of portuguese caravels


 dutch trade and colonization in asia 


 rise of dutch control over asian trade in the 17th century 

portuguese decline in asia was accelerated by the attacks on their commercial empire by the dutch and the english which began a global struggle over empire in asia that lasted until the end of the seven years war in 1763 the netherlands revolt against spanish rule facilitated dutch encroachment of the portuguese monopoly over south and east asian trade the dutch looked on spains trade and colonies as potential spoils in war when the two crowns of the iberian peninsula were joined in 1581 the dutch felt free to attack portuguese territories in asia
by the 1590s a number of dutch companies were formed to finance trading expeditions in asia because competition lowered their profits and because of the doctrines of mercantilism in 1602 the companies united into a cartel and formed the dutch east india company and received from the government the right to trade and colonise territory in the area stretching from the cape of good hope eastward to the strait of magellan
in 1605 armed dutch merchants captured the portuguese fort at amboyna in the moluccas which was developed into the first secure base of the company over time the dutch gradually consolidated control over the great trading ports of the east indies control over the east indies trading ports allowed the company to monopolise the world spice trade for decades their monopoly over the spice trade became complete after they drove the portuguese from malacca in 1641 and ceylon in 1658

dutch east india company colonies or outposts were later established in atjeh aceh 1667 macassar 1669 and bantam 1682 the company established its headquarters at batavia today jakarta on the island of java outside the east indies the dutch east india company colonies or outposts were also established in persia iran bengal now bangladesh and part of india mauritius 1638-1658/1664-1710 siam now thailand guangzhou canton china taiwan 1624–1662 and southern india 1616–1795
ming dynasty china defeated the dutch east india company in the sino-dutch conflicts the chinese first defeated and drove the dutch out of the pescadores in 1624 the ming navy under zheng zhilong defeated the dutch east india companys fleet at the 1633 battle of liaoluo bay in 1662 zheng zhilongs son zheng chenggong also known as koxinga expelled the dutch from taiwan after defeating them in the siege of fort zeelandia see history of taiwan further the dutch east india company trade post on dejima 1641–1857 an artificial island off the coast of nagasaki was for a long time the only place where europeans could trade with japan
the vietnamese nguyễn lords defeated the dutch in a naval battle in 1643
the cambodians defeated the dutch in the cambodian–dutch war in 1644
in 1652 jan van riebeeck established an outpost at the cape of good hope the southwestern tip of africa currently in south africa to restock company ships on their journey to east asia this post later became a fully-fledged colony the cape colony 1652–1806 as cape colony attracted increasing dutch and european settlement the dutch founded the city of kaapstad cape town
by 1669 the dutch east india company was the richest private company in history with a huge fleet of merchant ships and warships tens of thousands of employees a private army consisting of thousands of soldiers and a reputation on the part of its stockholders for high dividend payments


 dutch new imperialism in asia 

the company was in almost constant conflict with the english relations were particularly tense following the amboyna massacre in 1623 during the 18th century dutch east india company possessions were increasingly focused on the east indies after the fourth war between the united provinces and england 1780–1784 the company suffered increasing financial difficulties in 1799 the company was dissolved commencing official colonisation of the east indies during the era of new imperialism the territorial claims of the dutch east india company voc expanded into a fully fledged colony named the dutch east indies partly driven by re-newed colonial aspirations of fellow european nation states the dutch strived to establish unchallenged control of the archipelago now known as indonesia
six years into formal colonisation of the east indies in europe the dutch republic was occupied by the french forces of napoleon the dutch government went into exile in england and formally ceded its colonial possessions to great britain the pro-french governor general of java jan willem janssens resisted a british invasion force in 1811 until forced to surrender british governor raffles who the later founded the city of singapore ruled the colony the following 10 years of the british interregnum 1806–1816
after the defeat of napoleon and the anglo-dutch treaty of 1814 colonial government of the east indies was ceded back to the dutch in 1817 the loss of south africa and the continued scramble for africa stimulated the dutch to secure unchallenged dominion over its colony in the east indies the dutch started to consolidate its power base through extensive military campaigns and elaborate diplomatic alliances with indigenous rulers ensuring the dutch tricolor was firmly planted in all corners of the archipelago these military campaigns included the padri war 1821–1837 the java war 1825–1830 and the aceh war 1873–1904 this raised the need for a considerable military buildup of the colonial army knil from all over europe soldiers were recruited to join the knilthe dutch concentrated their colonial enterprise in the dutch east indies indonesia throughout the 19th century the dutch lost control over the east indies to the japanese during much of world war ii following the war the dutch fought indonesian independence forces after japan surrendered to the allies in 1945 in 1949 most of what was known as the dutch east indies was ceded to the independent republic of indonesia in 1962 also dutch new guinea was annexed by indonesia de facto ending dutch imperialism in asia


 british in india 


 portuguese french and british competition in india 1600–1763 

the english sought to stake out claims in india at the expense of the portuguese dating back to the elizabethan era in 1600 queen elizabeth i incorporated the english east india company later the british east india company granting it a monopoly of trade from the cape of good hope eastward to the strait of magellan in 1639 it acquired madras on the east coast of india where it quickly surpassed portuguese goa as the principal european trading centre on the indian subcontinent
through bribes diplomacy and manipulation of weak native rulers the company prospered in india where it became the most powerful political force and outrivaled its portuguese and french competitors for more than one hundred years english and french trading companies had fought one another for supremacy and by the middle of the 18th century competition between the british and the french had heated up french defeat by the british under the command of robert clive during the seven years war 1756–1763 marked the end of the french stake in india


 collapse of mughal india 

the british east india company although still in direct competition with french and dutch interests until 1763 was able to extend its control over almost the whole of india in the century following the subjugation of bengal at the 1757 battle of plassey the british east india company made great advances at the expense of a mughal dynasty
the reign of aurangzeb had marked the height of mughal power by 1690 mughal territorial expansion reached its greatest extent aurangzebs empire encompassed the entire indian subcontinent but this period of power was followed by one of decline fifty years after the death of aurangzeb the great mughal empire had crumbled meanwhile marauding warlords nobles and others bent on gaining power left the subcontinent increasingly anarchic although the mughals kept the imperial title until 1858 the central government had collapsed creating a power vacuum


 from company to crown 

aside from defeating the french during the seven years war robert clive the leader of the company in india defeated a key indian ruler of bengal at the decisive battle of plassey 1757 a victory that ushered in the beginning of a new period in indian history that of informal british rule while still nominally the sovereign the mughal indian emperor became more and more of a puppet ruler and anarchy spread until the company stepped into the role of policeman of india the transition to formal imperialism characterised by queen victoria being crowned empress of india in the 1870s was a gradual process the first step toward cementing formal british control extended back to the late 18th century the british parliament disturbed by the idea that a great business concern interested primarily in profit was controlling the destinies of millions of people passed acts in 1773 and 1784 that gave itself the power to control company policies and to appoint the highest company official in india the governor-general this system of dual control lasted until 1858 by 1818 the east india company was master of all of india some local rulers were forced to accept its overlordship others were deprived of their territories some portions of india were administered by the british directly in others native dynasties were retained under british supervision

until 1858 however much of india was still officially the dominion of the mughal emperor anger among some social groups however was seething under the governor-generalship of james dalhousie 1847–1856 who annexed the punjab 1849 after victory in the second sikh war annexed seven princely states using the doctrine of lapse annexed the key state of oudh on the basis of misgovernment and upset cultural sensibilities by banning hindu practices such as sati
the 1857 sepoy rebellion or indian mutiny an uprising initiated by indian troops called sepoys who formed the bulk of the companys armed forces was the key turning point rumour had spread among them that their bullet cartridges were lubricated with pig and cow fat the cartridges had to be bit open so this upset the hindu and muslim soldiers the hindu religion held cows sacred and for muslims pork was considered haraam in one camp 85 out of 90 sepoys would not accept the cartridges from their garrison officer the british harshly punished those who would not by jailing them the indian people were outraged and on may 10 1857 sepoys marched to delhi and with the help of soldiers stationed there captured it fortunately for the british many areas remained loyal and quiescent allowing the revolt to be crushed after fierce fighting one important consequence of the revolt was the final collapse of the mughal dynasty the mutiny also ended the system of dual control under which the british government and the british east india company shared authority the government relieved the company of its political responsibilities and in 1858 after 258 years of existence the company relinquished its role trained civil servants were recruited from graduates of british universities and these men set out to rule india lord canning created earl in 1859 appointed governor-general of india in 1856 became known as clemency canning as a term of derision for his efforts to restrain revenge against the indians during the indian mutiny when the government of india was transferred from the company to the crown canning became the first viceroy of india
the company initiated the first of the anglo-burmese wars in 1824 which led to total annexation of burma by the crown in 1885 the british ruled burma as a province of british india until 1937 then administered her separately under the burma office except during the japanese occupation of burma 1942–1945 until granted independence on 4 january 1948 unlike india burma opted not to join the commonwealth of nations


 rise of indian nationalism 

the denial of equal status to indians was the immediate stimulus for the formation in 1885 of the indian national congress initially loyal to the empire but committed from 1905 to increased self-government and by 1930 to outright independence the home charges payments transferred from india for administrative costs were a lasting source of nationalist grievance though the flow declined in relative importance over the decades to independence in 1947
although majority hindu and minority muslim political leaders were able to collaborate closely in their criticism of british policy into the 1920s british support for a distinct muslim political organisation the muslim league from 1906 and insistence from the 1920s on separate electorates for religious minorities is seen by many in india as having contributed to hindu-muslim discord and the countrys eventual partition


 france in indochina 

france which had lost its empire to the british by the end of the 18th century had little geographical or commercial basis for expansion in southeast asia after the 1850s french imperialism was initially impelled by a nationalistic need to rival the united kingdom and was supported intellectually by the notion that french culture was superior to that of the people of annam vietnam and its mission civilisatrice—or its civilizing mission of the annamese through their assimilation to french culture and the catholic religion the pretext for french expansionism in indochina was the protection of french religious missions in the area coupled with a desire to find a southern route to china through tonkin the european name for a region of northern vietnam
french religious and commercial interests were established in indochina as early as the 17th century but no concerted effort at stabilizing the french position was possible in the face of british strength in the indian ocean and french defeat in europe at the beginning of the 19th century a mid-19th century religious revival under the second empire provided the atmosphere within which interest in indochina grew anti-christian persecutions in the far east provided the pretext for the bombardment of tourane danang in 1847 and invasion and occupation of danang in 1857 and saigon in 1858 under napoleon iii france decided that french trade with china would be surpassed by the british and accordingly the french joined the british against china in the second opium war from 1857 to 1860 and occupied parts of vietnam as its gateway to china
by the treaty of saigon in 1862 on june 5 the vietnamese emperor ceded france three provinces of southern vietnam to form the french colony of cochinchina france also secured trade and religious privileges in the rest of vietnam and a protectorate over vietnams foreign relations gradually french power spread through exploration the establishment of protectorates and outright annexations their seizure of hanoi in 1882 led directly to war with china 1883–1885 and the french victory confirmed french supremacy in the region france governed cochinchina as a direct colony and central and northern vietnam under the protectorates of annam and tonkin and cambodia as protectorates in one degree or another laos too was soon brought under french protection
by the beginning of the 20th century france had created an empire in indochina nearly 50 percent larger than the mother country a governor-general in hanoi ruled cochinchina directly and the other regions through a system of residents theoretically the french maintained the precolonial rulers and administrative structures in annam tonkin cochinchina cambodia and laos but in fact the governor-generalship was a centralised fiscal and administrative regime ruling the entire region although the surviving native institutions were preserved in order to make french rule more acceptable they were almost completely deprived of any independence of action the ethnocentric french colonial administrators sought to assimilate the upper classes into frances superior culture while the french improved public services and provided commercial stability the native standard of living declined and precolonial social structures eroded indochina which had a population of over eighteen million in 1914 was important to france for its tin pepper coal cotton and rice it is still a matter of debate however whether the colony was commercially profitable


 russia and the great game 

tsarist russia is not often regarded as a colonial power such as the united kingdom or france because of the manner of russian expansions unlike the united kingdom which expanded overseas the russian empire grew from the centre outward by a process of accretion like the united states in the 19th century russian expansion took the form of a struggle of an effectively landlocked country for access to a warm water port
qing china defeated russia in the sino-russian border conflicts
while the british were consolidating their hold on india russian expansion had moved steadily eastward to the pacific then toward the middle east in the early 19th century it succeeded in conquering the south caucasus and dagestan from qajar persia following the russo-persian war 1804–13 the russo-persian war 1826–28 and the out coming treaties of gulistan and turkmenchay giving russia direct borders with both persias as well as ottoman turkeys heartlands later they eventually reached the frontiers of afghanistan as well which had the largest foreign border adjacent to british holdings in india in response to russian expansion the defense of indias land frontiers and the control of all sea approaches to the subcontinent via the suez canal the red sea and the persian gulf became preoccupations of british foreign policy in the 19th century
anglo-russian rivalry in the middle east and central asia led to a brief confrontation over afghanistan in the 1870s in persia iran both nations set up banks to extend their economic influence the united kingdom went so far as to invade tibet a land subordinate to the chinese empire in 1904 but withdrew when it became clear that russian influence was insignificant and when chinese resistance proved tougher than expected
in 1907 the united kingdom and russia signed an agreement which — on the surface —ended their rivalry in central asia see anglo-russian entente as part of the entente russia agreed to deal with the sovereign of afghanistan only through british intermediaries in turn the united kingdom would not annex or occupy afghanistan chinese suzerainty over tibet also was recognised by both russia and the united kingdom since nominal control by a weak china was preferable to control by either power persia was divided into russian and british spheres of influence and an intervening neutral zone the united kingdom and russia chose to reach these uneasy compromises because of growing concern on the part of both powers over german expansion in strategic areas of china and africa
following the entente russia increasingly intervened in persian domestic politics and suppressed nationalist movements that threatened both st petersburg and london after the russian revolution russia gave up its claim to a sphere of influence though soviet involvement persisted alongside the united kingdoms until the 1940s
in the middle east in persia iran and the ottoman empire a german company built a railroad from constantinople to baghdad and the persian gulf in the latter while it built a railroad from the north of the country to the south connecting the caucasus with the persian gulf in the former germany wanted to gain economic influence in the region and then perhaps move on to india this was met with bitter resistance by the united kingdom russia and france who divided the region among themselves


 western european and russian intrusions into china 

the 16th century brought many jesuit missionaries to china such as matteo ricci who established missions where western science was introduced and where europeans gathered knowledge of chinese society history culture and science during the 18th century merchants from western europe came to china in increasing numbers however merchants were confined to guangzhou and the portuguese colony of macau as they had been since the 16th century european traders were increasingly irritated by what they saw as the relatively high customs duties they had to pay and by the attempts to curb the growing import trade in opium by 1800 its importation was forbidden by the imperial government however the opium trade continued to boom
early in the 19th century serious internal weaknesses developed in the qing dynasty that left china vulnerable to western meiji period japanese and russian imperialism in 1839 china found itself fighting the first opium war with britain china was defeated and in 1842 signed the provisions of the treaty of nanjing which were first of the unequal treaties signed during the qing dynasty hong kong island was ceded to britain and certain ports including shanghai and guangzhou were opened to british trade and residence in 1856 the second opium war broke out the chinese were again defeated and now forced to the terms of the 1858 treaty of tientsin the treaty opened new ports to trade and allowed foreigners to travel in the interior in addition christians gained the right to propagate their religion the united states treaty of wanghia and russia later obtained the same prerogatives in separate treaties
toward the end of the 19th century china appeared on the way to territorial dismemberment and economic vassalage—the fate of indias rulers that played out much earlier several provisions of these treaties caused long-standing bitterness and humiliation among the chinese extraterritoriality meaning that in a dispute with a chinese person a westerner had the right to be tried in a court under the laws of his own country customs regulation and the right to station foreign warships in chinese waters including its navigable rivers
jane e elliott criticized the allegation that china refused to modernize or was unable to defeat western armies as simplistic noting that china embarked on a massive military modernization in the late 1800s after several defeats buying weapons from western countries and manufacturing their own at arsenals such as the hanyang arsenal during the boxer rebellion in addition elliott questioned the claim that chinese society was traumatized by the western victories as many chinese peasants 90% of the population at that time living outside the concessions continued about their daily lives uninterrupted and without any feeling of humiliationhistorians have judged the qing dynastys vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness while it achieved military success against westerners on land the historian edward l dreyer said that china’s nineteenth-century humiliations were strongly related to her weakness and failure at sea at the start of the opium war china had no unified navy and no sense of how vulnerable she was to attack from the sea british forces sailed and steamed wherever they wanted to goin the arrow war 1856-60 the chinese had no way to prevent the anglo-french expedition of 1860 from sailing into the gulf of zhili and landing as near as possible to beijing meanwhile new but not exactly modern chinese armies suppressed the midcentury rebellions bluffed russia into a peaceful settlement of disputed frontiers in central asia and defeated the french forces on land in the sino-french war 1884-85 but the defeat of the fleet and the resulting threat to steamship traffic to taiwan forced china to conclude peace on unfavorable termsduring the sino-french war chinese forces defeated the french at the battle of cầu giấy paper bridge bắc lệ ambush battle of phu lam tao battle of zhenhai the battle of tamsui in the keelung campaign and in the last battle which ended the war the battle of bang bo zhennan pass which triggered the french retreat from lạng sơn and resulted in the collapse of the french jules ferry government in the tonkin affair
the qing dynasty forced russia to hand over disputed territory in ili in the treaty of saint petersburg 1881 in what was widely seen by the west as a diplomatic victory for the qing russia acknowledged that qing china potentially posed a serious military threat mass media in the west during this era portrayed china as a rising military power due to its modernization programs and as a major threat to the western world invoking fears that china would successfully conquer western colonies like australiathe british observer demetrius charles de kavanagh boulger suggested a british-chinese alliance to check russian expansion in central asia
during the ili crisis when qing china threatened to go to war against russia over the russian occupation of ili the british officer charles george gordon was sent to china by britain to advise china on military options against russia should a potential war break out between china and russiathe russians observed the chinese building up their arsenal of modern weapons during the ili crisis the chinese bought thousands of rifles from germany in 1880 massive amounts of military equipment and rifles were shipped via boats to china from antwerp as china purchased torpedoes artillery and 260,260 modern rifles from europethe russian military observer d v putiatia visited china in 1888 and found that in northeastern china manchuria along the chinese-russian border the chinese soldiers were potentially able to become adept at european tactics under certain circumstances and the chinese soldiers were armed with modern weapons like krupp artillery winchester carbines and mauser riflescompared to russian controlled areas more benefits were given to the muslim kirghiz on the chinese controlled areas russian settlers fought against the muslim nomadic kirghiz which led the russians to believe that the kirghiz would be a liability in any conflict against china the muslim kirghiz were sure that in an upcoming war that china would defeat russiarussian sinologists the russian media threat of internal rebellion the pariah status inflicted by the congress of berlin the negative state of the russian economy all led russia to concede and negotiate with china in st petersburg and return most of ili to china

the rise of japan since the meiji restoration as an imperial power led to further subjugation of china in a dispute over chinas longstanding claim of suzerainty in korea war broke out between china and japan resulting in humiliating defeat for the chinese by the treaty of shimonoseki 1895 china was forced to recognize effective japanese rule of korea and taiwan was ceded to japan until its recovery in 1945 at the end of the wwii by the republic of china
chinas defeat at the hands of japan was another trigger for future aggressive actions by western powers in 1897 germany demanded and was given a set of exclusive mining and railroad rights in shandong province russia obtained access to dairen and port arthur and the right to build a railroad across manchuria thereby achieving complete domination over a large portion of northwestern china the united kingdom and france also received a number of concessions at this time much of china was divided up into spheres of influence germany dominated jiaozhou kiaochow bay shandong and the yellow river valley russia dominated the liaodong peninsula and manchuria the united kingdom dominated weihaiwei and the yangtze valley and france dominated the guangzhou bay and several other southern provinces

china continued to be divided up into these spheres until the united states which had no sphere of influence grew alarmed at the possibility of its businessmen being excluded from chinese markets in 1899 secretary of state john hay asked the major powers to agree to a policy of equal trading privileges in 1900 several powers agreed to the us-backed scheme giving rise to the open door policy denoting freedom of commercial access and non-annexation of chinese territory in any event it was in the european powers interest to have a weak but independent chinese government the privileges of the europeans in china were guaranteed in the form of treaties with the qing government in the event that the qing government totally collapsed each power risked losing the privileges that it already had negotiated
the erosion of chinese sovereignty and seizures of land from chinese by foreigners contributed to a spectacular anti-foreign outbreak in june 1900 when the boxers properly the society of the righteous and harmonious fists attacked foreigners around beijing the imperial court was divided into anti-foreign and pro-foreign factions with the pro-foreign faction led by ronglu and prince qing hampering any military effort by the anti-foreign faction led by prince duan and dong fuxiang the qing empress dowager ordered all diplomatic ties to be cut off and all foreigners to leave the legations in beijing to go to tianjin the foreigners refused to leave fueled by entirely false reports that the foreigners in the legations were massacred the eight-nation alliance decided to launch an expedition on beijing to reach the legations but they underestimated the qing military the qing and boxers defeated the foreigners at the seymour expedition forcing them to turn back at the battle of langfang in response to the foreign attack on dagu forts the qing responded by declaring war against the foreigners the qing forces and foreigners fought a fierce battle at the battle of tientsin before the foreigners could launch a second expedition on their second try gaselee expedition with a much larger force the foreigners managed to reach beijing and fight the battle of peking 1900 british and french forces looted plundered and burned the old summer palace to the ground for the second time the first time being in 1860 following the second opium war german forces were particularly severe in exacting revenge for the killing of their ambassador due to the orders of kaiser wilhelm ii who held anti-asian sentiments while russia tightened its hold on manchuria in the northeast until its crushing defeat by japan in the war of 1904–1905 the qing court evacuated to xian and threatened to continue the war against foreigners until the foreigners tempered their demands in the boxer protocol promising that china would not have to give up any land and gave up the demands for the execution of dong fuxiang and prince duan
the correspondent douglas story observed chinese troops in 1907 and praised their abilities and military skillextraterritorial jurisdiction was abandoned by the united kingdom and the united states in 1943 chiang kai-shek forced the french to hand over all their concessions back to china control after world war ii foreign political control over leased parts of china ended with the incorporation of hong kong and the small portuguese territory of macau into the peoples republic of china in 1997 and 1999 respectively


 usa imperialism in asia 

some americans in the nineteenth century advocated for the annexation of taiwan from china aboriginals on taiwan often attacked and massacred shipwrecked western sailors in 1867 during the rover incident taiwanese aborigines attacked shipwrecked american sailors killing the entire crew they subsequently defeated a retaliatory expedition by the american military and killed another american during the battleas the united states emerged as a new imperial power in the pacific and asia one of the two oldest western imperialist powers in the regions spain was finding it increasingly difficult to maintain control of territories it had held in the regions since the 16th century in 1896 a widespread revolt against spanish rule broke out in the philippines meanwhile the recent string of us territorial gains in the pacific posed an even greater threat to spains remaining colonial holdings
as the us continued to expand its economic and military power in the pacific it declared war against spain in 1898 during the spanish–american war us admiral dewey destroyed the spanish fleet at manila and us troops landed in the philippines spain later agreed by treaty to cede the philippines in asia and guam in the pacific in the caribbean spain ceded puerto rico to the us the war also marked the end of spanish rule in cuba which was to be granted nominal independence but remained heavily influenced by the us government and us business interests one year following its treaty with spain the us occupied the small pacific outpost of wake island
the filipinos who assisted us troops in fighting the spanish wished to establish an independent state and on june 12 1898 declared independence from spain in 1899 fighting between the filipino nationalists and the us broke out it took the us almost fifteen years to fully subdue the insurgency the us sent 70,000 troops and suffered thousands of casualties the filipinos insurgents however suffered considerably higher casualties than the americans most casualties in the war were civilians dying primarily from diseaseus attacks into the countryside often included scorched earth campaigns where entire villages were burned and destroyed and concentrated civilians into camps known as protected zones most of these civilian casualties resulted from disease and famine reports of the execution of us soldiers taken prisoner by the filipinos led to disproportionate reprisals by american forces
the moro muslims fought against the americans in the moro rebellion
in 1914 dean c worcester us secretary of the interior for the philippines 1901–1913 described the regime of civilisation and improvement which started with american occupation and resulted in developing naked savages into cultivated and educated men nevertheless some americans such as mark twain deeply opposed american involvementimperialism in the philippines leading to the abandonment of attempts to construct a permanent us naval base and using it as an entry point to the chinese market in 1916 congress guaranteed the independence of the philippines by 1945


 world war i changes in imperialism 
world war i brought about the fall of several empires in europe this had repercussions around the world the defeated central powers included germany and the turkish ottoman empire germany lost all of its colonies in asia german new guinea a part of papua new guinea became administered by australia german possessions and concessions in china including qingdao became the subject of a controversy during the paris peace conference when the beiyang government in china agreed to cede these interests to japan to the anger of many chinese people although the chinese diplomats refused to sign the agreement these interests were ceded to japan with the support of the united states and the united kingdom
turkey gave up her provinces syria palestine and mesopotamia now iraq came under french and british control as league of nations mandates the discovery of petroleum first in iran and then in the arab lands in the interbellum provided a new focus for activity on the part of the united kingdom france and the united states


 japan 

in 1641 all westerners were thrown out of japan for the next two centuries japan was free from western influence except for at the port of nagasaki which japan allowed dutch merchant vessels to enter on a limited basis
japans freedom from western penetration ended on 8 july 1853 when commodore matthew perry of the us navy sailed a squadron of black-hulled warships into edo modern tokyo harbor the japanese told perry to sail to nagasaki but he refused perry sought to present a letter from us president millard fillmore to the emperor which demanded concessions from japan japanese authorities responded by stating that they could not present the letter directly to the emperor but scheduled a meeting on july 14 with a representative of the emperor on 14 july the squadron sailed towards the shore giving a demonstration of their cannons firepower thirteen times perry landed with a large detachment of marines and presented the emperors representative with fillmores letter perry said he would return and did so this time with even more war ships the us show of force led to japans concession to the convention of kanagawa on 31 march 1854 this treaty conferred extraterritoriality on american nationals as well as opening up further treaty ports beyond nagasaki this treaty was followed up by similar treaties with the united kingdom the netherlands russia and france these events made japanese authorities aware that the country was lacking technologically and needed the strength of industrialism in order to keep their power this realisation eventually led to a civil war and political reform known the meiji restoration
the meiji restoration of 1868 led to administrative overhaul deflation and subsequent rapid economic development japan had limited natural resources of her own and sought both overseas markets and sources of raw materials fuelling a drive for imperial conquest which began with the defeat of china in 1895

taiwan ceded by qing dynasty china became the first japanese colony in 1899 japan won agreements from the great powers to abandon extraterritoriality for their citizens and an alliance with the united kingdom established it in 1902 as an international power its spectacular defeat of russias navy in 1905 gave it the southern half of the island of sakhalin exclusive japanese influence over korea propinquity the former russian lease of the liaodong peninsula with port arthur lüshunkou and extensive rights in manchuria see the russo-japanese war
the empire of japan and the joseon dynasty in korea formed bilateral diplomatic relations in 1876 china lost its suzerainty of korea after defeat in the sino-japanese war in 1894 russia also lost influence on the korean peninsula with the treaty of portsmouth as a result of the russo-japanese war in 1904 the joseon dynasty became increasingly dependent on japan korea became a protectorate of japan with the japan–korea treaty of 1905 korea was then de jure annexed to japan with the japan–korea treaty of 1910
japan was now one of the most powerful forces in the far east and in 1914 it entered world war i on the side of the allies seizing german-occupied kiaochow and subsequently demanding chinese acceptance of japanese political influence and territorial acquisitions twenty-one demands 1915 mass protests in peking in 1919 coupled with allied and particularly us opinion led to japans abandonment of most of the demands and joseons 1922 return to china japan received the german territory from the treaty of versailles 1919 sparking widespread chinese nationalism
tensions with china increased over the 1920s and in 1931 japanese army units based in manchuria seized control of the region without direction from tokyo intermittent conflict with china led to full-scale war in mid-1937 drawing japan toward an overambitious bid for asian hegemony greater east asia co-prosperity sphere which ultimately led to defeat and the loss of all its overseas territories after world war ii see japanese expansionism and japanese nationalism


 after world war ii 


 decolonisation and the rise of nationalism in asia 
in the aftermath of world war ii european colonies controlling more than one billion people throughout the world still ruled most of the middle east south east asia and the indian subcontinent however the image of european pre-eminence was shattered by the wartime japanese occupations of large portions of british french and dutch territories in the pacific the destabilisation of european rule led to the rapid growth of nationalist movements in asia—especially in indonesia malaya burma and french indochina vietnam cambodia and laos

the war however only accelerated forces already in existence undermining western imperialism in asia throughout the colonial world the processes of urbanisation and capitalist investment created professional merchant classes that emerged as new westernised elites while imbued with western political and economic ideas these classes increasingly grew to resent their unequal status under european rule


 british in india and the middle east 
in india the westward movement of japanese forces towards bengal during world war ii had led to major concessions on the part of british authorities to indian nationalist leaders in 1947 the united kingdom devastated by war and embroiled in economic crisis at home granted british india its independence as two nations india and pakistan myanmar burma and sri lanka ceylon which is also part of british india also gained their independence from the united kingdom the following year in 1948 in the middle east the united kingdom granted independence to jordan in 1946 and two years later in 1948 ended its mandate of palestine becoming the independent nation of israel
following the end of the war nationalists in indonesia demanded complete independence from the netherlands a brutal conflict ensued and finally in 1949 through united nations mediation the dutch east indies achieved independence becoming the new nation of indonesia dutch imperialism moulded this new multi-ethnic state comprising roughly 3,000 islands of the indonesian archipelago with a population at the time of over 100 million
the end of dutch rule opened up latent tensions between the roughly 300 distinct ethnic groups of the islands with the major ethnic fault line being between the javanese and the non-javanese
netherlands new guinea was under the dutch administration until 1962 see also west new guinea dispute


 united states in asia 
in the philippines the us remained committed to its previous pledges to grant the islands their independence and the philippines became the first of the western-controlled asian colonies to be granted independence post-world war ii however the philippines remained under pressure to adopt a political and economic system similar to their old imperial master
this aim was greatly complicated by the rise of new political forces during the war the hukbalahap peoples army which had strong ties to the communist party of the philippines pkp fought against the japanese occupation of the philippines and won strong popularity among many sectors of the filipino working class and peasantry in 1946 the pkp participated in elections as part of the democratic alliance however with the onset of the cold war its growing political strength drew a reaction from the ruling government and the united states resulting in the repression of the pkp and its associated organisations in 1948 the pkp began organizing an armed struggle against the government and continued us military presence in 1950 the pkp created the peoples liberation army hukbong mapagpalaya ng bayan which mobilised thousands of troops throughout the islands the insurgency lasted until 1956 when the pkp gave up armed struggle
in 1968 the pkp underwent a split and in 1969 the maoist faction of the pkp created the new peoples army maoist rebels re-launched an armed struggle against the government and the us military presence in the philippines which continues to this day


 france in indochina 


 post-war resistance to french rule 

france remained determined to retain its control of indochina however in hanoi in 1945 a broad front of nationalists and communists led by ho chi minh declared an independent republic of vietnam commonly referred to as the viet minh regime by western outsiders france seeking to regain control of vietnam countered with a vague offer of self-government under french rule frances offers were unacceptable to vietnamese nationalists and in december 1946 the việt minh launched a rebellion against the french authority governing the colonies of french indochina the first few years of the war involved a low-level rural insurgency against french authority however after the chinese communists reached the northern border of vietnam in 1949 the conflict turned into a conventional war between two armies equipped with modern weapons supplied by the united states and the soviet union meanwhile the france granted the state of vietnam based in saigon independence in 1949 while laos and cambodia received independence in 1953 the us recognized the regime in saigon and provided the french military effort with military aid
meanwhile in vietnam the french war against the viet minh continued for nearly eight years the french were gradually worn down by guerrilla and jungle fighting the turning point for france occurred at dien bien phu in 1954 which resulted in the surrender of ten thousand french troops paris was forced to accept a political settlement that year at the geneva conference which led to a precarious set of agreements regarding the future political status of laos cambodia and vietnam
