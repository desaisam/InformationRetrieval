 duchy 

in the 14th and early 15th centuries three members of the house of luxembourg reigned as holy roman emperors in 1437 the house of luxembourg suffered a succession crisis precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne which led to the territories being sold by duchess elisabeth to philip the good of burgundyin the following centuries luxembourgs fortress was steadily enlarged and strengthened by its successive occupants the bourbons habsburgs hohenzollerns and the french


 nineteenth century 
after the defeat of napoleon in 1815 luxembourg was disputed between prussia and the netherlands the congress of vienna formed luxembourg as a grand duchy within the german confederation the dutch king became in personal union the grand duke although he was supposed to rule the grand duchy as an independent country with an administration of its own in reality he treated it similarly to a dutch province the fortress of luxembourg was manned by prussian troops for the german confederation this arrangement was revised by the 1839 first treaty of london from which date luxembourgs full independence is reckonedat the time of the belgian revolution of 1830–1839 and by the 1839 treaty establishing full independence luxembourgs territory was reduced by more than half as the predominantly francophone western part of the country was transferred to belgium in 1842 luxembourg joined the german customs union zollverein this resulted in the opening of the german market the development of luxembourgs steel industry and expansion of luxembourgs railway network from 1855 to 1875 particularly the construction of the luxembourg-thionville railway line with connections from there to the european industrial regions while prussian troops still manned the fortress in 1861 the passerelle was opened the first road bridge spanning the pétrusse river valley connecting the ville haute and the main fortification on the bock with luxembourg railway station opened in 1859 on the then fortified bourbon plateau to the south

 language

three languages are recognised as official in luxembourg french german and luxembourgish a franconian language of the moselle region that is also spoken in neighbouring parts of belgium germany and france though luxembourgish is part of the west central german group of high german languages more than 5,000 words in the language are of french origin the first printed sentences in luxembourgish appeared in a weekly journal the luxemburger wochenblatt in the second edition on 14 april 1821
apart from being one of the three official languages luxembourgish is also considered the national language of the grand duchy it is the mother tongue or language of the heart for the local population
every citizen or resident has the right to address the administration in the language of their choice among the three official languages and to be answered in that language
due to the historical influence of the napoleonic code on the legal system of the grand duchy french is the sole language of the legislation french is generally the preferred language of the government administration and justice the parliamentary debates are however mostly conducted in luxembourgish whereas the written government communications and the official documents eg administrative or judicial decisions passports etc are drafted only in french
each of the three languages is used as the primary language in certain spheres of the everyday-life without being exclusive luxembourgish is the language that luxembourgers generally use to speak to each other but it is not often used as the written language and the numerous expatriate workers approximately 60% of the population generally do not use it to speak to each other since the 1980s however an increasing number of novels have been written in luxembourgish most official business is carried out in french german is very often used in much of the media alongside with french french is mostly used for written communications from the authorities to the public
a 2009 survey pointed out that french was the language spoken by most inhabitants 99 followed by luxembourgish 82 german 81 and english 72 
although professional life is largely multilingual french is described by private sector business leaders as the main working language of their companies 56 followed by luxembourgish 20 english 18 and german 6
