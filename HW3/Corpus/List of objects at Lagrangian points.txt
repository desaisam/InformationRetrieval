this is a list of known objects which occupy have occupied or are planned to occupy any of the five lagrangian points of two-body systems in space


 sun–earth lagrangian points 


 l1 
l1 is the lagrangian point located approximately 1.5 million km from earth towards the sun


 past probes 
international cometary explorer formerly the international sun–earth explorer 3 isee-3 diverted out of l1 in 1983 for a comet rendezvous mission  currently in heliocentric orbit
nasas genesis probe collected solar wind samples at l1 from december 3 2001 to april 1 2004 when it returned the sample capsule to earth it returned briefly in late 2004 before being pushed into heliocentric orbit in early 2005
lisa pathfinder


 present probes 

the solar and heliospheric observatory soho
the advanced composition explorer ace
wind spacecraft at l1 since 2004
the deep space climate observatory dscovr designed to image the sunlit earth in 10 wavelengths epic and monitor total reflected radiation nistar


 planned probes 
aditya-l1
kuafu


 l2 
l2 is the lagrangian point located approximately 1.5 million km from earth in the direction opposite the sun


 past probes 

nasas wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe wmap observed the cosmic microwave background from 2001 until 2010 it was moved to a heliocentric orbit to avoid posing a hazard to future missions
nasas wind from november 2003 to april 2004 the spacecraft then went to earth orbit before heading to l1
the esa herschel space observatory exhausted its supply of liquid helium and was moved from the lagrangian point in june 2013
at the end of its mission esas planck spacecraft was put into a heliocentric orbit and passivated to prevent it from endangering any future missions
cnsas change 2 from august 2011 to april 2012 change 2 was then placed onto a heliocentric orbit that took it past the near-earth asteroid 4179 toutatis


 present probes 
the esa gaia probe


 planned probes 
the joint russian-german high-energy astrophysics observatory spektr-rg
the esa euclid mission to better understand dark energy and dark matter by accurately measuring the acceleration of the universe
the joint nasa esa and csa james webb space telescope jwst formerly known as the next generation space telescope ngst
the esa plato mission which will find and characterize rocky exoplanets
the nasa wide field infrared survey telescope wfirst
the esa ariel mission which will observe the atmospheres of exoplanets
the esa advanced telescope for high energy astrophysics athena
the nasa advanced technology large-aperture space telescope which would replace the hubble space telescope and possibly the jwst


 cancelled probes 
the esa eddington mission
the nasa terrestrial planet finder mission may be placed in an earth-trailing orbit instead


 l3 
l3 is the sun–earth lagrangian point located on the side of the sun opposite earth slightly outside the earths orbit

there are no known objects in this orbital location


 l4 
l4 is the sun–earth lagrangian point located close to the earths orbit 60° ahead of earth

asteroid 2010 tk7 is the first discovered tadpole orbit companion to earth orbiting l4 with a mean distance of about one astronomical unit
stereo a solar terrestrial relations observatory – ahead made its closest pass to l4 in september 2009 on its orbit around the sun slightly faster than earth
osiris-rex passed near the l4 point and performed a survey for asteroids between 9 and 20 february 2017


 l5 
l5 is the sun–earth lagrangian point located close to the earths orbit 60° behind earth

asteroid 419624 2010 so16 in a horseshoe companion orbit with earth is currently proximal to l5 but at a high inclination
stereo b solar terrestrial relations observatory – behind made its closest pass to l5 in october 2009 on its orbit around the sun slightly slower than earth
the spitzer space telescope is in an earth-trailing heliocentric orbit drifting away c 0.1 au per year in c 2013–15 it has passed l5 in its orbit
hayabusa2 passed near l5 during the spring of 2017 and imaged the surrounding area to search for earth trojans in 18 april 2018


 earth–moon lagrangian points 


 l2 
artemis
change 5-t1
queqiao relay satellite


 l4 and l5 
kordylewski clouds
future location of tdrs-style communication satellites to support l2 satellite


 past probes 
hiten was the first spacecraft to demonstrate a low energy trajectory passing by l4 and l5 to achieve lunar orbit at a very low fuel expense compared to usual orbital techniques hiten did not find any conclusive increase in dust density at lagrange points


 proposed objects 
exploration gateway platform
in his 1976 book the high frontier human colonies in space dr gerard oneill proposed the establishment of gigantic space islands in l5 the inhabitants of the l5 society should convert lunar material to huge solar power satellites many works of fiction most notably the gundam series involve colonies at these locations


 sun–venus lagrangian points 


 l4 
2013 nd15


 sun–mars lagrangian points 
asteroids in the l4 and l5 sun–mars lagrangian points are sometimes called mars trojans with a lower-case t as trojan asteroid was originally defined as a term for lagrangian asteroids of jupiter they may also be called mars lagrangian asteroids
