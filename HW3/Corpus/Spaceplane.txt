a spaceplane is an aerospace vehicle that operates as an aircraft in earths atmosphere as well as a spacecraft when it is in space it combines features of an aircraft and a spacecraft which can be thought of as an aircraft that can endure and maneuver in the vacuum of space or likewise a spacecraft that can fly like an airplane typically it takes the form of a spacecraft equipped with wings although lifting bodies have been designed and tested as well the propulsion to reach space may be purely rocket based or may use the assistance of airbreathing jet engines the spaceflight is then followed by an unpowered glide return to landing
five kinds of spaceplanes have successfully flown to date having reentered earths atmosphere returned to earth and safely landed — the north american x-15 space shuttle buran spaceshipone and boeing x-37  all five are considered rocket gliders as of  2015 only these aircraft and rockets have succeeded in reaching space  two of these five x-15 and spaceshipone are rocket-powered aircraft having been carried up to an altitude of several tens of thousands of feet by an atmospheric mother ship before being released and then flying beyond the kármán line the boundary of earths atmosphere under their own power  three space shuttle buran and x-37 are vertical takeoff horizontal landing vthl vehicles relying upon rocket lift for the ascent phase in reaching space and atmospheric lift for reentry descent and landing the three vthl spaceplanes flew much further than the aircraft launched ones not merely leaving earths atmosphere but also entering orbit around it which requires at least 50 times more energy on the way up and heavy heat shielding for the trip back of the five vehicles three have been piloted by astronauts with the buran and x-37 flying unmanned missions


 description 

significant features distinguish spaceplanes from traditional spacecraft


 aerodynamic lift 

all aircraft utilize aerodynamic surfaces in order to generate lift for spaceplanes a variety of wing shapes can be used delta wings are common but straight wings lifting bodies and even rotorcraft have been proposed typically the force of lift generated by these surfaces is many times that of the drag that they induce


 atmospheric reentry 

because suborbital spaceplanes are designed for trajectories that do not reach orbital speed they do not need the kinds of thermal protection orbital spacecraft required during the hypersonic phase of atmospheric reentry the space shuttle thermal protection system for example protects the orbiter from surface temperatures that could otherwise reach as high as 1,650 °c 3,000 °f well above the melting point of steel


 aircraft landing 

a spaceplane operates as an aircraft in earths atmosphere  aircraft may land on firm runways helicopter landing pads or even water amphibious aircraft snow or ice  to land the airspeed and the rate of descent are reduced such that the aircraft descends at a slow enough rate to allow for a gentle touch down landing is accomplished by slowing down and descending this speed reduction is accomplished by reducing thrust andor inducing a greater amount of drag using flaps landing gear or speed brakes  splashdown is an easier technical feat to accomplish requiring only the deployment of a parachute or parachutes rather than successfully aviating the atmosphere project geminis original concept design was as a spaceplane with paraglider and wheels or skis attached  however this concept was abandoned in favor of parachute splashdowns because of expensive technical failures during testing and development  whereas project geminis splashdown parachutes took only 5 months to develop in 1963 geminis spaceplane concept failed to materialize even after nearly 3 years of continued development


 propulsion 


 rocket engines 
all spaceplanes to date have used rocket engines with chemical fuels   as the orbital insertion burn has to be done in space orbital spaceplanes require rocket engines for at least that portion of the flight


 airbreathing engines 

a difference between rocket based and air-breathing aerospace plane launch systems is that aerospace plane designs typically include minimal oxidizer storage for propulsion  air-breathing aerospace plane designs include engine inlets so they can use atmospheric oxygen for combustion  since the mass of the oxidizer is at takeoff the single largest mass of most rocket designs the space shuttles liquid oxygen tank weighs 629,340 kg more than one of its solid rocket boosters this provides a huge potential weight savings benefit however air breathing engines are usually very much heavier than rocket engines and the empty weight of the oxidizer tank and since unlike oxidizer this extra weight which is not expended to add kinetic energy to the vessel as is propellant mass must be carried into space it may offset the overall system performancetypes of air breathing engines proposed for spaceplanes include scramjet liquid air cycle engines precooled jet engines pulse detonation engine and ramjets some engine designs combine several types of engines features into a combined cycle for instance the rocket-based combined cycle rbcc engine uses a rocket engine inside a ramscoop so that at low speed the rockets thrust is boosted by ejector augmented thrust it then transitions to ramjet propulsion at near-supersonic speeds then to supersonic combustion or scramjet propulsion above mach 6 then back to pure rocket propulsion above mach 10


 harsh flight environment 
the flight trajectory required of air-breathing aerospace vehicles to reach orbit is to fly what is known as a depressed trajectory which places the aerospace plane in the high-altitude hypersonic flight regime of the atmosphere  this environment induces high dynamic pressure high temperature and high heat flow loads particularly upon the leading edge surfaces of the aerospace plane  these loads typically require special advanced materials active cooling or both for the structures to survive the environment
rocket-powered spaceplanes also face a significant thermal environment if they are burning for orbit but this is nevertheless far less severe than air-breathing spaceplanessuborbital space planes designed to briefly reach space do not require significant thermal protection as they experience peak heating for only a short time during re-entry intercontinental suborbital trajectories require much higher speeds and thermal protection more similar to orbital spacecraft reentry


 center of mass issues 
a wingless launch vehicle has lower aerodynamic forces affecting the vehicle and attitude control can be active perhaps with some fins to aid stability for a winged vehicle the centre of lift moves during the atmospheric flight as well as the centre of mass and the vehicle spends longer in the atmosphere as well historically the x-33 and hotol spaceplanes were rear engined and had relatively heavy engines this puts a heavy mass at the rear of the aircraft with wings that had to hold up the vehicle as the wet mass reduces the centre of mass tends to move rearward behind the centre of lift which tends to be around the centre of the wings this can cause severe instability that is usually solved by extra fins which add weight and decrease performance


 flown spaceplanes 


 orbital spaceplanes 
all three of the orbital spaceplanes successfully flown to date utilize a vthl vertical takeoff horizontal landing design  they include the piloted united states space shuttle and two unmanned spaceplanes  the late-1980s soviet buran and the early-2010s boeing x-37
the early-1980s bor-4 subscale test vehicle for the spiral spaceplane that was subsequently cancelled was a spacecraft that did successfully reenter the atmosphere and fly like an aircraft  but it was not designed to sustain atmospheric flight  it was designed to stop flying open a parachute and then splash in the ocean
these vehicles have used wings to provide aerobraking to return from orbit and to provide lift allowing them to land on a runway like conventional aircraft these vehicles are still designed to ascend to orbit vertically under rocket power like conventional expendable launch vehicles one drawback of spaceplanes is that they have a significantly smaller payload fraction than a ballistic design with the same takeoff weight this is in part due to the weight of the wings — around 9–12% of the weight of the atmospheric flight weight of the vehicle this significantly reduces the payload size but the reusability is intended to offset this disadvantage
while all spaceplanes have used atmospheric lift for the reentry phase none to date have succeeded in a design that relies on aerodynamic lift for the ascent phase in reaching space excluding a mother ship first stage efforts such as the silbervogel and x-30x-33 have all failed to materialize into a vehicle capable of successfully reaching space the pegasus winged booster has had many successful flights to deploy orbital payloads but since its aerodynamic vehicle component operates only as a booster and not operate in space as a spacecraft it is not typically considered to be a spaceplaneon the other hand orex is a test vehicle of hope-x and launched into 450 km leo using h-ii in 1994 orex succeeded to reenter but it was only hemispherical head of hope-x that is not plane-shaped


 suborbital spaceplanes 

other spaceplane designs are suborbital requiring far less energy for propulsion and can use the vehicles wings to provide lift for the ascent to space in addition to the rocket as of 2018 three such crafts flew successfully to and from space back to earth namely the north american x-15 and virgin galactic spaceshipone and spaceshiptwo all these crafts were not capable of entering orbit and all of them began their independent flight only after being lifted to high altitude by a carrier aircraft

scaled composites and virgin galactic unveiled on 7 december 2009 the spaceshiptwo space plane the vss enterprise and its whiteknighttwo mothership eve spaceshiptwo is designed to carry two pilots and six passengers on suborbital flights on 13 december 2018 spaceshiptwo vss unity successfully crossed the space above 50 miles altitude boundary hyflex was a miniaturized suborbital demonstrator of hope-x launched in 1996 hyflex flew to 110 km altitude and succeeded in atmospheric reentry subsequently achieving hypersonic flight though hyflex achieved a controlled aircraft descent it was not designed for a planned aircraft landing the engineers opting instead for a splashdown without a parachute recovery of the hyflex failed and it sank in the pacific ocean


 proposed spaceplanes 

various types of spaceplanes have been suggested since the early twentieth century notable early designs include friedrich zanders spaceplane equipped with wings made of combustible alloys that it would burn during its ascent and eugen sängers silbervogel bomber design also in germany and then in the us winged versions of the v-2 rocket were considered during and after world war ii and when public interest in space exploration was high in the 1950s and 60s winged rocket designs by wernher von braun and willy ley served to inspire science fiction artists and filmmakers


 united states 
the us air force invested some effort in a paper study of a variety of spaceplane projects under their aerospaceplane efforts of the late 1950s but later ended these when they decided to use a modified version of sängers design the result boeing x-20 dyna-soar was to have been the first orbital spaceplane but was canceled in the early 1960s in lieu of nasas project gemini and the us air forces manned orbiting laboratory program
in 1961 nasa originally planned to have the gemini spacecraft land on a firm solid ground runway with a rogallo wing airfoil rather than as a splashdown with parachute  the test vehicle became known as the paraglider research vehicle development work on both geminis splashdown parachute and spaceplane paraglider began in 1963  by december 1963 the parachute was already to undergo full-scale deployment testing  on the other hand by december 1963 the paraglider spaceplane concept was running into technical difficulties and subsequently became replaced by the parachute splashdown concept  though attempts to revive geminis paraglider spaceplane concept persisted within nasa and north american aviation as late as 1964 nasa headquarters gemini chief william schneider discontinued development as technical hurdles became too expensive

the rockwell x-30 national aero-space plane nasp begun in the 1980s was an attempt to build a scramjet vehicle capable of operating like an aircraft and achieving orbit like the shuttle president ronald reagan described nasp in his 1986 state of the union address as a new orient express that could by the end of the next decade take off from dulles airport and accelerate up to twenty-five times the speed of sound attaining low earth orbit or flying to tokyo within two hours
there were six identifiable technologies which were considered critical to the success of the nasp project  three of these enabling technologies were related to the propulsion system which would consist of a hydrogen-fueled scramjetthe nasp program became the hypersonic systems technology program hystp in late 1994 hystp was designed to transfer the accomplishments made in hypersonic technologies by the national aero-space plane nasp program into a technology development program on 27 january 1995 the air force terminated participation in hystp it was canceled due to increasing technical challenges and growing budgetsin 1994 mitchell burnside clapp proposed a single stage to orbit peroxidekerosene spaceplane called black horse it was to take off almost empty and undergo mid-air refueling before launching to orbitthe lockheed martin x-33 was a 1/3 scale prototype made as part of an attempt by nasa to build a ssto hydrogen-fuelled spaceplane venturestar that failed when the hydrogen tank design proved to be unconstructable in the planned way
the edition of 5 march 2006 of aviation week  space technology published a story purporting to be outing a highly classified us military two-stage-to-orbit spaceplane system with the code name blackstar sr-3xov among other nicknames

in 1999 nasa started the boeing x-37 project an unmanned remote controlled spaceplane the project was transferred to the us department of defense in 2004boeing has proposed that a larger variant of the x-37b the x-37c could be built to carry up to six passengers up to leo  the spaceplane would also be usable for carrying cargo with both upmass and downmass return to earth cargo capacity  the ideal size for the proposed derivative is approximately 165 to 180 percent of the current x-37bin december 2010 orbital sciences made a commercial proposal to nasa to develop the prometheus a lifting-body spaceplane vehicle about one-quarter the size of the space shuttle in response to nasas commercial crew development ccdev phase 2 solicitation  the vehicle would be launched on a human-rated upgraded atlas v rocket but would land on a runway
for the same solicitation sierra nevada corporation proposed phase 2 extensions of its dream chaser spaceplane technology partially developed under the first phase of nasas ccdev program both the orbital sciences proposal and the dream chaser are lifting body designs  sierra nevada will utilize virgin galactic to market dream chaser commercial services and may use virgins whiteknighttwo carrier aircraft as a platform for drop trials of the dream chaser atmospheric test vehicle
nasa expects to make approximately 200 million of phase 2 awards by march 2011 for technology development projects that could last up to 14 months


 soviet union and russia 

the soviet union firstly considered a preliminary design of rocket-launch small spaceplane lapotok in early 1960s then the spiral airspace system with small orbital spaceplane and rocket as second stage was widely developed in the 1960s–1980s mikoyan-gurevich mig-105 was a manned test vehicle to explore low-speed handling and landing


 cosmoplane 
in recent times an orbital spaceplane called cosmoplane russian космоплан capable of transporting passengers has been proposed by russias institute of applied mechanics according to researchers it could take about 20 minutes to fly from moscow to paris using hydrogen and oxygen-fueled engines


 united kingdom 

the multi-unit space transport and recovery device mustard was a concept explored by the british aircraft corporation bac around 1968 for launching payloads weighing as much as 2,300 kg 5,000 lb into orbit it was never constructed the british government also began development of a ssto-spaceplane called hotol but the project was canceled due to technical and financial issuesthe lead engineer from the hotol project has since set up a private company dedicated to creating a similar plane called skylon with a different combined cycle rocketturbine precooled jet engine called sabre this vehicle is intended to be capable of a single stage to orbit launch carrying a 15,000 kg 33,000 lb payload into low earth orbit if successful it would be far in advance of anything currently in operationthe british company bristol spaceplanes has undertaken design and prototyping of three potential spaceplanes since its founding by david ashford in 1991 the european space agency has endorsed these designs on several occasions


 france and the european space agency 
france worked on the hermes manned spaceplane launched by ariane rocket in the late 20th century and proposed in january 1985 to go through with hermes development under the auspices of the esa hopper was one of several proposals for a european reusable launch vehicle rlv planned to cheaply ferry satellites into orbit by 2015  one of those was phoenix a german project which is a one-seventh scale model of the hopper concept vehicle the suborbital hopper was a festip future european space transportation investigations programme system  study design a test project the intermediate experimental vehicle ixv has demonstrated lifting reentry technologies and will be extended under the pride programme
the fast20xx future high-altitude high speed transport 20xx aims to establish sound technological foundations for the introduction of advanced concepts in suborbital high-speed transportation with air-launch-to-orbit alpha vehicle


 japan 
hope was a japanese experimental spaceplane project designed by a partnership between nasda and nal both now part of jaxa started in the 1980s it was positioned for most of its lifetime as one of the main japanese contributions to the international space station the other being the japanese experiment module the project was eventually cancelled in 2003 by which point test flights of a sub-scale testbed had flown successfully as of 2018 japan is developing the winged reusable sounding rocket wires which if successful may be used as a recoverable first-stage or as a crewed sub-orbital spaceplane


 germany 
after the german sänger-bredt rabo and silbervogel of the 1930s and 1940s eugen sänger worked for time on various space plane projects coming up with several designs for messerschmitt-bölkow-blohm such as the mbb raumtransporter-8 in the 1980s west germany funded design work on the mbb sänger ii with the hypersonic technology program development continued on mbbdeutsche aerospace sänger iihorus until the late 1980s when it was canceled germany went on to participate in the ariane rocket columbus space station and hermes spaceplane of esa spacelab of esa-nasa and deutschland missions non-us funded space shuttle flights with spacelab the sänger ii had predicted cost savings of up to 30 percent over expendable rockets the daimler-chrysler aerospace rlv was a much later small reusable spaceplane prototype for esa future launchers preparatory programmefltp program
most recent project is spaceliner
