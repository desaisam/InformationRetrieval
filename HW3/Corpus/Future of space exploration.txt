the future of space exploration involves both telescopic exploration and the physical exploration of space by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight
near-term physical exploration missions have been announced by or are being planned by both national and private organisations focussed on obtaining new information about the solar system in the longer term there are tentative plans for crewed orbital and landing missions to the moon and mars establishing scientific outposts that will later make way for permanent and self sufficient settlements further exploration will potentially involve expeditions and settlements on the other planets and their moons as well as establishing mining and fueling outposts particularly in the asteroid belt physical exploration outside the solar system will be robotic for the foreseeable future

 limitations with deep space exploration 
the future possibilities for deep space exploration are currently held back by a set of technical practical astronomical and human limitations which define the future of manned and unmanned space exploration as of 2017 the farthest any man-made probe has traveled is the current nasa mission voyager 1 currently about 13 billion miles 21 billion km or 19.5 light hours away from the earth while the nearest star is around 4.24 light years away


 technical limitations 
the current status of space-faring technology including propulsion systems navigation resources and storage all present limitations to the development of human space exploration in the near future


 distances 
the astronomical order of magnitude of the distance between us and the nearest stars is a challenge for the current development of space exploration at our current top speed of 157,100 miles per hour 70.2 kms the helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star proxima centauri in around 18,000 years much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available


 propulsion and fuel 

in terms of propulsion the main challenge is the liftoff and initial momentum since there is no friction in the vacuum of space based on the missions goals including factors such as distance load and time of flight the type of propulsion drive used planned to use or in design varies from chemical propellants such as liquid hydrogen and oxidizer space shuttle main engine to plasma or even nanoparticle propellants

as for future developments the theoretical possibilities of nuclear based propulsion have been analyzed over 60 years ago such as nuclear fusion project daedalus and nuclear pulse propulsion project longshot but have since been discontinued from practical research by nasa on the more science fiction side the theoretical alcubierre drive presents a mathematical solution for “faster-than-light” travel but it would require the mass-energy of jupiter not to mention the technical issues


 human limitations 
the human element in manned space exploration adds certain physiological and psychological issues and limitations to the future possibilities of space exploration along with storage and sustenance space and mass issues


 physiological issues 
the transitioning gravity magnitudes on the body is detrimental to orientation coordination and balance without constant gravity bones suffer disuse osteoporosis and their mineral density falls 12 times faster than the average elderly adult’s without regular exercise and nourishment there can be cardiovascular deterioration and loss in muscle strength dehydration can cause kidney stones and constant hydro-static potential in zero-g can shift body fluids upwards and cause vision problemsfurthermore without earth’s surrounding magnetic field as a shield solar radiation has much harsher effects on biological organisms in space the exposure can include damage to the central nervous system altered cognitive function reducing motor function and incurring possible behavioral changes as well as the possibility of degenerative tissue diseases


 psychological issues 

according to nasa isolation in space can have detrimental effects on the human psyche behavioral issues such as low morale mood-swings depression and decreasing interpersonal interactions irregular sleeping rhythms and fatigue occur independently to the level of training according to a set of nasas social experiments the most famous of which biosphere 2 was a 2 year long 8 person crew experiment in the 1990s in an attempt to study human necessities and survival in an isolated environment the result of which were stressed interpersonal interactions and aloof behavior including limiting and even ceasing contact between crew members along with failing to sustain a lasting air-recycling system and food supply


 resources and sustenance 
considering the future possibility of extended manned missions food storage and resupply are relevant limitations from a storage point of view nasa estimates a 3-year mars mission would require around 24 thousand pounds 10,000 kg of food most of it in the form of precooked dehydrated meals of about 1.5 pounds a portion fresh produce would only be available in the beginning of the flight since there would not be refrigeration systems waters relative heavy weight is a limitation so on the international space station iss the use of water per person is limited to 11 liters a day compared to the average americans 132 liters

as for resupply efforts have been made to recycle reuse and produce to make storage more efficient water can be produced through chemical reactions of hydrogen and oxygen in fuel cells and attempts and methods of growing vegetables in micro-gravity are being developed and will continue to be researched lettuce has already successfully grown in the isss veggie plant growth system and has been consumed by the astronauts even though large-scale plantation is still impractical due to factors such as pollination long growth periods and lack of efficient planting pillows


 artificial intelligence and robotic space craft development 
the idea of using high level automated systems for space missions has become a desirable goal to space agencies all around the world such systems are believed to yield benefits such as lower cost less human oversight and ability to explore deeper in space which is usually restricted by long communications with human controllers autonomy will be a key technology for the future exploration of our solar system where robotic spacecraft will often be out of communication with their human controllers


 autonomous systems 
autonomy is defined by three requirements

the ability to make and carry out decisions on their own based on information on what they sensed from the world and their current state
the ability to interpret the given goal as a list of actions to take
the ability to fail flexibly meaning they are able to continuously change their actions based on what is happening within their system and their surroundingcurrently there are many projects trying to advance space exploration and space craft development using ai


 nasas autonomous science experiment 
nasa began its autonomous science experiment ase on earth observing-1 eo-1 which is nasas first satellite in the millennium program earth-observing series launched on november 21 2000 the autonomy of these satellites is capable of on-board science analysis re-planning robust execution and model-based diagnostic images obtained by the eo-1 are analyzed on-board and down linked when a change or interesting event occurs the ase software has successfully provided over 10,000 science images this experiment was the start of many that nasa devised for ai to impact the future of space exploration


 artificial intelligence flight adviser 
nasas goal with this project is to develop a system that can aid pilots by giving them real-time expert advice in situations that pilot training does not cover or just aid with a pilots train of thought during flight based on the ibm watson cognitive computing system the ai flight adviser pulls data from a large database of relevant information like aircraft manuals accident reports and close-call reports to give advice to pilots in the future nasa wants to implement this technology to create fully autonomous systems which can then be used for space exploration in this case cognitive systems will serve as the basis and the autonomous system will completely decide on the course of action of the mission even during unforeseen situations however in order for this to happen there are still many supporting technologies required
in the future nasa hopes to use this technology not only in flights on earth but for future space exploration essentially nasa plans to modify this ai flight advisor for longer range applications in addition to what the technology is now there will be additional cognitive computing systems that can decide on the right set of actions based upon unforeseen problems in space however in order for this to be possible there are still many supporting technologies that need to be enhanced


 stereo vision for collision avoidance 
for this project nasas goal is to implement stereo vision for collision avoidance in space systems to work with and support autonomous operations in a flight environment this technology uses two cameras within its operating system that have the same view but when put together offer a large range of data that gives a binocular image because of its duo-camera system nasas research indicate that this technology can detect hazards in rural and wilderness flight environments because of this project nasa has made major contributions toward developing a completely autonomous uav currently stereo vision can construct a stereo vision system process the vision data make sure the system works properly and lastly performs tests figuring out the range of impeding objects and terrain in the future nasa hopes this technology can also determine the path to avoid collision the near-term goal for the technology is to be able to extract information from point clouds and place this information in a historic map data using this map the technology could then be able to extrapolate obstacles and features in the stereo data that are not in the map data this would aid with the future of space exploration where humans cant see moving impeding objects that may damage the moving space craft


 benefits of ai 
autonomous technologies would be able to perform beyond predetermined actions they would analyze all possible states and events happening around them and come up with a safe response in addition such technologies can reduce launch cost and ground involvement performance would increase as well autonomy would be able to quickly respond upon encountering an unforeseen event especially in deep space exploration where communication back to earth would take too long space exploration could provide us with the knowledge of our universe as well as incidentally developing inventions and innovations traveling to mars and farther could encourage the development of advances in medicine health longevity transportation communications that could have applications on earth


 robotic space craft development 


 energy 


 solar panels 
changes in space craft development will have to account for an increased energy need for future systems spacecrafts heading towards the center of our solar system will include enhanced solar panel technology to make use of the abundant solar energy surrounding them future solar panel development is aimed at their working more efficiently while being lighter


 radioisotope thermoelectric generators 
radioisotope thermoelectric generators are solid-state devices which have no moving parts they generate heat from the radioactive decay of elements such as plutonium and have a typical lifespan of more than 30 years in the future atomic sources of energy for spacecraft will hopefully be lighter and last longer than they do currentlythey could be particularly useful for missions to the outer solar system which receives substantially less sunlight meaning that producing a substantial power output with solar panels would be impractical
