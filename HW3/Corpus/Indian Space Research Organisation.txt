the indian space research organisation isro  is the space agency of the government of india headquartered in the city of bengaluru its vision is to harness space technology for national development while pursuing space science research and planetary explorationformed in 1969 isro superseded the erstwhile indian national committee for space research incospar established in 1962 by the efforts of independent indias first prime minister jawaharlal nehru and his close aide and scientist vikram sarabhai the establishment of isro thus institutionalised space activities in india it is managed by the department of space which reports to the prime minister of india
isro built indias first satellite aryabhata which was launched by the soviet union on 19 april 1975 it was named after the mathematician aryabhata in 1980 rohini became the first satellite to be placed in orbit by an indian-made launch vehicle slv-3 isro subsequently developed two other rockets the polar satellite launch vehicle pslv for launching satellites into polar orbits and the geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle gslv for placing satellites into geostationary orbits these rockets have launched numerous communications satellites and earth observation satellites satellite navigation systems like gagan and irnss have been deployed in january 2014 isro used an indigenous cryogenic engine in a gslv-d5 launch of the gsat-14isro sent a lunar orbiter chandrayaan-1 on 22 october 2008 and a mars orbiter mars orbiter mission on 5 november 2013 which entered mars orbit on 24 september 2014 making india the first nation to succeed on its first attempt to mars and isro the fourth space agency in the world as well as the first space agency in asia to reach mars orbit on 18 june 2016 isro set a record with a launch of twenty satellites in a single payload one being a satellite from google on 15 february 2017 isro launched one hundred and four satellites in a single rocket pslv-c37 and created a world record isro launched its heaviest rocket geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle-mark iii gslv-mk iii on 5 june 2017 and placed a communications satellite gsat-19 in orbit with this launch isro became capable of launching 4-ton heavy satellites into gto
future plans include the development of unified launch vehicle small satellite launch vehicle development of a reusable launch vehicle human spaceflight controlled soft lunar landing interplanetary probes and a solar spacecraft mission


 formative years 

modern space research in india is most visibly traced to the 1920s when the scientist s k mitra conducted a series of experiments leading to the sounding of the ionosphere by application of ground-based radio methods in calcutta later indian scientists like cv raman and meghnad saha contributed to scientific principles applicable in space sciences however it was the period after 1945 that saw important developments being made in coordinated space research in india organised space research in india was spearheaded by two scientists vikram sarabhai—founder of the physical research laboratory at ahmedabad—and homi bhabha who established the tata institute of fundamental research in 1945 initial experiments in space sciences included the study of cosmic radiation high altitude and airborne testing deep underground experimentation at the kolar mines—one of the deepest mining sites in the world—and studies of the upper atmosphere studies were carried out at research laboratories universities and independent locationsin 1950 the department of atomic energy was founded with bhabha as its secretary the department provided funding for space research throughout india during this time tests continued on aspects of meteorology and the earths magnetic field a topic that was being studied in india since the establishment of the observatory at colaba in 1823 in 1954 the uttar pradesh state observatory was established at the foothills of the himalayas the rangpur observatory was set up in 1957 at osmania university hyderabad space research was further encouraged by the technically inclined prime minister of india jawaharlal nehru in 1957 the soviet union  launched sputnik 1 and opened up possibilities for the rest of the world to conduct a space launchthe indian national committee for space research incospar was set up in 1962 by jawaharlal nehru first prime minister of india


 goals and objectives 
the prime objective of isro is to use space technology and its application to various national tasks the indian space programme was driven by the vision of vikram sarabhai considered the father of the indian space programme as he said in 1969

there are some who question the relevance of space activities in a developing nation to us there is no ambiguity of purpose we do not have the fantasy of competing with the economically advanced nations in the exploration of the moon or the planets or manned space-flight but we are convinced that if we are to play a meaningful role nationally and in the community of nations we must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to the real problems of man and society

former president of india a p j abdul kalam said

many individuals with myopic vision questioned the relevance of space activities in a newly independent nation which was finding it difficult to feed its population their vision was clear if indians were to play meaningful role in the community of nations they must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to their real-life problems they had no intention of using it as a means of displaying our might

indias economic progress has made its space program more visible and active as the country aims for greater self-reliance in space technology in 2008 india launched as many as eleven satellites including nine from other countries and went on to become the first nation to launch ten satellites on one rocket isro has put into operation two major satellite systems indian national satellites insat for communication services and indian remote sensing irs satellites for management of natural resources
in july 2012 abdul kalam said that research was being done by isro and drdo for developing cost reduction technologies for access to space

 telecommunication 
india uses its satellites communication network – one of the largest in the world – for applications such as land management water resources management natural disaster forecasting radio networking weather forecasting meteorological imaging and computer communication business administrative services and schemes such as the national informatics centre nic are direct beneficiaries of applied satellite technology dinshaw mistry on the subject of practical applications of the indian space program writes

the insat-2 satellites also provide telephone links to remote areas data transmission for organisations such as the national stock exchange mobile satellite service communications for private operators railways and road transport and broadcast satellite services used by indias state-owned television agency as well as commercial television channels indias edusat educational satellite launched aboard the gslv in 2004 was intended for adult literacy and distance learning applications in rural areas it augmented and would eventually replace such capabilities already provided by insat-3b


 resource management 
the irs satellites have found applications with the indian natural resource management program with regional remote sensing service centres in five indian cities and with remote sensing application centres in twenty indian states that use irs images for economic development applications these include environmental monitoring analysing soil erosion and the impact of soil conservation measures forestry management determining land cover for wildlife sanctuaries delineating groundwater potential zones flood inundation mapping drought monitoring estimating crop acreage and deriving agricultural production estimates fisheries monitoring mining and geological applications such as surveying metal and mineral deposits and urban planning


 military 
integrated space cell under the integrated defense services headquarters of the indian ministry of defense has been set up to utilize more effectively the countrys space-based assets for military purposes and to look into threats to these assets this command will leverage space technology including satellites unlike an aerospace command where the air force controls most of its activities the integrated space cell envisages cooperation and coordination between the three services as well as civilian agencies dealing with space with 14 satellites including gsat-7a for the exclusive military use and the rest as dual use satellites india has the fourth largest number of satellites active in the sky which includes satellites for the exclusive use of indian air force and indian navy respectively gsat-7a an advanced military communications satellite exclusively for the indian air force is similar to indian navys gsat-7 and gsat-7a will enhance network-centric warfare capabilities of the indian air force by interlinking different ground radar stations ground airbase and airborne early warning and control awacs aircraft such as beriev a-50 phalcon and drdo aewcs gsat-7a will also be used by indian armys aviation corps for its helicopters and uavs operations in 2013 isro had launched gsat-7 for the exclusive use of the indian navy to monitor the indian ocean region ior with the satellites 2,000 nautical mile ‘footprint’ and real-time input capabilities to indian warships submarines and maritime aircraft to boost its network-centric operations the iaf is also likely to get another satellite gsat-7c within a few yearsindias satellites and satellite launch vehicles have had military spin-offs while indias 93–124-mile 150–200-kilometre range prithvi missile is not derived from the indian space programme the intermediate range agni missile is drawn from the indian space programmes slv-3 in its early years when headed by vikram sarabhai and satish dhawan isro opposed military applications for its dual-use projects such as the slv-3 eventually however the defence research and development organisation drdo based missile programme borrowed human resources and technology from isro missile scientist apj abdul kalam elected president of india in 2002 who had headed the slv-3 project at isro moved to drdo to direct indias missile programme about a dozen scientists accompanied kalam from isro to drdo where he designed the agni missile using the slv-3s solid fuel first stage and a liquid-fuel prithvi-missile-derived second stage the irs and insat satellites were primarily intended and used for civilian-economic applications but they also offered military spin-offs in 1996 new delhis ministry of defence temporarily blocked the use of irs-1c by indias environmental and agricultural ministries to monitor ballistic missiles near indias borders in 1997 the indian air forces airpower doctrine aspired to use space assets for surveillance and battle management


 academic 
institutions like the indira gandhi national open university and the indian institutes of technology use satellites for scholarly applications between 1975 and 1976 india conducted its largest sociological programme using space technology reaching 2400 villages through video programming in local languages aimed at educational development via ats-6 technology developed by nasa this experiment—named satellite instructional television experiment site—conducted large scale video broadcasts resulting in significant improvement in rural education education could reach far remote rural places with the help of above programs


 telemedicine 
isro has applied its technology for telemedicine directly connecting patients in rural areas to medical professionals in urban locations via satellites since high-quality healthcare is not universally available in some of the remote areas of india the patients in remote areas are diagnosed and analysed by doctors in urban centers in real time via video conferencing the patient is then advised medicine and treatment the patient is then treated by the staff at one of the super-specialty hospitals under instructions from the doctor mobile telemedicine vans are also deployed to visit locations in far-flung areas and provide diagnosis and support to patients


 biodiversity information system 
isro has also helped implement indias biodiversity information system completed in october 2002 nirupa sen details the program based on intensive field sampling and mapping using satellite remote sensing and geospatial modeling tools maps have been made of vegetation cover on a 1 250,000 scale this has been put together in a web-enabled database that links gene-level information of plant species with spatial information in a biospec database of the ecological hot spot regions namely northeastern india western ghats western himalayas and andaman and nicobar islands this has been made possible with collaboration between the department of biotechnology and isro


 cartography 
the indian irs-p5 cartosat-1 was equipped with high-resolution panchromatic equipment to enable it for cartographic purposes irs-p5 cartosat-1 was followed by a more advanced model named irs-p6 developed also for agricultural applications the cartosat-2 project equipped with single panchromatic camera that supported scene-specific on-spot images succeeded the cartosat-1 project


 international co-operation 
isro has had international co-operation since inception some instances are listed below

establishment of terls conduct of site  step launches of aryabhata bhaskara apple irs-ia and irs-ib satellites manned space mission etc involved international co-operation
