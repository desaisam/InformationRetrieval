 etymology 
the name kazakh comes from the ancient turkic word qaz to wander reflecting the kazakhs nomadic culture the name cossack is of the same origin the persian suffix -stan means land or place of so kazakhstan can be literally translated as land of the wanderers
though traditionally referring only to ethnic kazakhs including those living in china russia turkey uzbekistan and other neighbouring countries the term kazakh is increasingly being used to refer to any inhabitant of kazakhstan including non-kazakhs


 history 

kazakhstan has been inhabited since the paleolithic pastoralism developed during the neolithic as the regions climate and terrain are best suited for a nomadic lifestyle the kazakh territory was a key constituent of the eurasian steppe route the ancestor of the terrestrial silk roads archaeologists believe that humans first domesticated the horse ie ponies in the regions vast steppes during recent prehistoric times central asia was inhabited by groups like the possibly proto-indo-european afanasievo culture  later early indo-iranians cultures such as andronovo and later indo-iranians such as the saka and massagetae


 kazakh khanate 

the cuman entered the steppes of modern-day kazakhstan around the early 11th century where they later joined with the kipchak and established the vast cuman-kipchak confederation while ancient cities taraz aulie-ata and hazrat-e turkestan had long served as important way-stations along the silk road connecting asia and europe true political consolidation began only with the mongol rule of the early 13th century under the mongol empire the largest in world history administrative districts were established these eventually came under the rule of the emergent kazakh khanate kazakhstan
throughout this period traditional nomadic life and a livestock-based economy continued to dominate the steppe in the 15th century a distinct kazakh identity began to emerge among the turkic tribes a process which was consolidated by the mid-16th century with the appearance of the kazakh language culture and economy
nevertheless the region was the focus of ever-increasing disputes between the native kazakh emirs and the neighbouring persian-speaking peoples to the south at its height the khanate would rule parts of central asia and control cumania by the early 17th century the kazakh khanate was struggling with the impact of tribal rivalries which had effectively divided the population into the great middle and little or small hordes jüz political disunion tribal rivalries and the diminishing importance of overland trade routes between east and west weakened the kazakh khanate khiva khanate used this opportunity and annexed mangyshlak peninsula uzbek rule there lasted two centuries until the russian arrival
during the 17th century the kazakhs fought oirats a federation of western mongol tribes including the dzungar the beginning of the 18th century marked the zenith of the kazakh khanate during this period the little horde participated in the 1723–1730 war against the dzungar following their great disaster invasion of kazakh territories under the leadership of abul khair khan the kazakh won major victories over the dzungar at the bulanty river in 1726 and at the battle of anrakay in 1729ablai khan participated in the most significant battles against the dzungar from the 1720s to the 1750s for which he was declared a batyr hero by the people the kazakh suffered from the frequent raids against them by the volga kalmyk the kokand khanate used the weakness of kazakh jüzs after dzungar and kalmyk raids and conquered present southeastern kazakhstan including almaty the formal capital in the first quarter of the 19th century also the emirate of bukhara ruled shymkent before the russians took dominance


 russian empire 

in the first half of the 18th century the russian empire constructed the irtysh line a series of forty-six forts and ninety-six redoubts including omsk 1716 semipalatinsk 1718 pavlodar 1720 orenburg 1743 and petropavlovsk 1752 to prevent kazakh and oirat raids into russian territory in the late 18th century the kazakhs took advantage of pugachevs rebellion which was centred on the volga area to raid russian and volga german settlements in the 19th century the russian empire began to expand its influence into central asia the great game period is generally regarded as running from approximately 1813 to the anglo-russian convention of 1907 the tsars effectively ruled over most of the territory belonging to what is now the republic of kazakhstan
the russian empire introduced a system of administration and built military garrisons and barracks in its effort to establish a presence in central asia in the so-called great game for dominance in the area against the british empire which was extending its influence from the south in india and southeast asia russia built its first outpost orsk in 1735 russia introduced the russian language in all schools and governmental organisations
russian efforts to impose its system aroused the resentment by the kazakh people and by the 1860s some kazakhs resisted russias rule it had disrupted the traditional nomadic lifestyle and livestock-based economy and people were suffering from hunger and starvation with some kazakh tribes being decimated the kazakh national movement which began in the late 19th century sought to preserve the native language and identity by resisting the attempts of the russian empire to assimilate and stifle them
from the 1890s onward ever-larger numbers of settlers from the russian empire began colonising the territory of present-day kazakhstan in particular the province of semirechye the number of settlers rose still further once the trans-aral railway from orenburg to tashkent was completed in 1906 a specially created migration department переселенческое управление in st petersburg oversaw and encouraged the migration to expand russian influence in the area during the 19th century about 400,000 russians immigrated to kazakhstan and about one million slavs germans jews and others immigrated to the region during the first third of the 20th century vasile balabanov was the administrator responsible for the resettlement during much of this time

the competition for land and water that ensued between the kazakh and the newcomers caused great resentment against colonial rule during the final years of the russian empire the most serious uprising the central asian revolt occurred in 1916 the kazakh attacked russian and cossack settlers and military garrisons the revolt resulted in a series of clashes and in brutal massacres committed by both sides both sides resisted the communist government until late 1919


 soviet union 

following the collapse of central government in petrograd in november 1917 the kazakhs then in russia officially referred to as kirghiz experienced a brief period of autonomy the alash autonomy to eventually succumb to the bolsheviks′ rule on 26 august 1920 the kirghiz autonomous socialist soviet republic within the russian soviet federative socialist republic rsfsr was established the kirghiz assr included the territory of the present-day kazakhstan but its administrative centre was a mainly russian-populated town of orenburg in june 1925 the kirghiz assr was renamed the kazak assr and its administrative centre was transferred to the town of kyzylorda and in april 1927 to alma-ata
soviet repression of the traditional elite along with forced collectivisation in the late 1920s and 1930s brought famine and high fatalities leading to unrest see also famine in kazakhstan of 1932–33 during the 1930s some members of the kazakh cultured society were executed — as part of the policies of political reprisals pursued by the soviet government in moscow
on 5 december 1936 the kazakh autonomous soviet socialist republic whose territory by then corresponded to that of modern kazakhstan was detached from the russian soviet federative socialist republic rsfsr and made the kazakh soviet socialist republic a full union republic of the ussr one of eleven such republics at the time along with the kirghiz soviet socialist republic
the republic was one of the destinations for exiled and convicted persons as well as for mass resettlements or deportations effected by the central ussr authorities during the 1930s and 1940s such as approximately 400,000 volga germans deported from the volga german autonomous soviet socialist republic in september–october 1941 later the greeks and crimean tatars deportees and prisoners were interned in some of the biggest soviet labour camps the gulag including alzhir camp outside astana which was reserved for the wives of men considered enemies of the people many moved due to the policy of population transfer in the soviet union and others were forced into involuntary settlements in the soviet union

the soviet-german war 1941–1945 led to an increase in industrialisation and mineral extraction in support of the war effort at the time of the ussrs leader joseph stalins death in 1953 however kazakhstan still had an overwhelmingly agricultural economy in 1953 soviet leader nikita khrushchev initiated the virgin lands campaign designed to turn the traditional pasture-lands of kazakhstan into a major grain-producing region for the soviet union the virgin lands policy brought mixed results however along with later modernisations under soviet leader leonid brezhnev in power 1964–1982 it accelerated the development of the agricultural sector which remains the source of livelihood for a large percentage of kazakhstans population because of the decades of privation war and resettlement by 1959 the kazakh had become a minority in the country making up 30% of the population ethnic russians accounted for 43in 1947 the ussr government as part of its atomic bomb project founded an atomic bomb test site near the north-eastern town of semipalatinsk where the first soviet nuclear bomb test was conducted in 1949 hundreds of nuclear tests were conducted until 1989 and had negative ecological and biological consequences the anti-nuclear movement in kazakhstan became a major political force in the late 1980s
in december 1986 mass demonstrations by young ethnic kazakhs later called the jeltoqsan riot took place in almaty to protest the replacement of the first secretary of the communist party of the kazakh ssr dinmukhamed konayev with gennady kolbin from the russian sfsr governmental troops suppressed the unrest several people were killed and many demonstrators were jailed in the waning days of soviet rule discontent continued to grow and found expression under soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs policy of glasnost

according to chinese written sources of 6th–8th centuries ce turkic tribes of kazakhstan had oral poetry tradition these came from earlier periods and were primarily transmitted by bards professional storytellers and musical performers traces of this tradition are shown on orkhon script stone carvings dated 5th–7th centuries ce that describe rule of kultegin and bilge two early turkic rulers kagans amongst the kazakhs the bard was a primarily though not exclusively male profession since at least the 17th century kazakh bards could be divided in two main categories the zhıraws zhiraus žyraus who passed on the works of others usually not creating and adding their own original work and the aqyns akyns who improvised or created their own poems stories or songs there were several types of works such as didactic termes elegiac tolgaws and epic zhırs although the origins of such tales are often unknown most of them were associated with bards of the recent or more distant past who supposedly created them or passed them on by the time most kazakh poetry and prose was first written down in the second half of the 19th century there are clear stylistic differences between works first created in the 19th century and works dating from earlier periods but not documented before the 19th century such as those attributed to such 16th- and 17th-century bards as er shoban and dosmombet zhıraw also known as dospambet žyrau he appeared to have been literate and reportedly visited constantinople and even to such 15th-century bards as shalkiz and asan qayghıother notable bards include kaztugan žyrau žiembet žyrau axtamberdy žyrau and buxar žyrau kalkamanuly who was an advisor to ablai khan and whose works have been preserved by mäšhür žüsip köpeev er targhın and alpamıs are two of the most famous examples of kazakh literature to be recorded in the 19th century the book of dede korkut and oguz name a story of ancient turkic king oghuz khan are the most well-known turkic heroic legends initially created around 9th century ce they were passed on through generations in oral form the legendary tales were recorded by turkish authors in 14–16th centuries cethe preeminent role in the development of modern literary kazakh belongs to abai qunanbaiuly kazakh абай құнанбайұлы sometimes russified to abay kunanbayev абай кунанбаев 1845–1904 whose writings did much to preserve kazakh folk culture abais major work is the book of words kazakh қара сөздері qara sözderi a philosophical treatise and collection of poems where he criticizes russian colonial policies and encourages other kazakhs to embrace education and literacy the literary magazines ay qap published between 1911 and 1915 in arabic script and qazaq published between 1913 and 1918 played an important role in the development of the intellectual and political life among early 20th-century kazakhs


 music 

the modern state of kazakhstan is home to the kazakh state kurmangazy orchestra of folk instruments the kazakh state philharmonic orchestra the kazakh national opera and the kazakh state chamber orchestra the folk instrument orchestra was named after kurmangazy sagyrbayuly a famous composer and dombra player from the 19th century the musical-dramatic training college founded in 1931 was the first institute of higher education for music two years later the orchestra of kazakh folk musical instruments was formed 1
the foundation asyl mura is archivating and publishing historical recordings of great samples of kazakh music both traditional and classical
the leading conservatoire is in almaty the qurmanghazy conservatoire it currently competes with the national conservatoire in astana kazakhstans capital
when referring to traditional kazakh music authentic folklore must be separated from folklorism the latter denotes music executed by academically trained performers who aim at preserving the traditional music for coming generations as far as can be reconstructed the music of kazakhstan from the period before a strong russian influence consists of instrumental music and vocal music instrumental music with the pieces küy being performed by soloists text is often seen in the background or program for the music as a lot of küy titles refer to stories vocal music either as part of a ceremony such as a wedding mainly performed by women or as part of a feast here we might divide into subgenres epic singing containing not only historical facts but as well the tribes genealogy love songs didactic verses and as a special form the composition of two or more singers in public aitys of dialogue character and usually unexpectedly frankly in content

the russian influence on the music life in kazakhstan can be seen in two spheres first the introduction of musical academic institutions such as concert houses with opera stages conservatories where the european music was performed and taught and second by trying to incorporate kazakh traditional music into these academic structures
controlled first by the russian empire and then the soviet union kazakhstans folk and classical traditions became connected with ethnic russian music and western european music prior to the 20th century kazakh folk music was collected and studied by ethnographic research teams including composers music critics and musicologists in the first part of the 19th century kazakh music was transcribed in linear notation some composers of this era set kazakh folk songs to russian-style european classical music
the kazakhs themselves however did not write their own music in notation until 1931 later as part of the soviet union kazakh folk culture was encouraged in a sanitized manner designed to avoid political and social unrest the result was a bland derivative of real kazakh folk music in 1920 aleksandr zatayevich a russian official created major works of art music with melodies and other elements of kazakh folk music beginning in 1928 and accelerating in the 1930s he also adapted traditional kazakh instruments for use in russian-style ensembles such as by increasing the number of frets and strings soon these styles of modern orchestral playing became the only way for musicians to officially play kazakh folk was turned into patriotic professional and socialist endeavors 2
the current situation could be described as the effort to rediscover the traditional music as it had been practised before the heavy influence of european musical styles although the quality of the performances and the striving for authenticity cannot be ignored it is for methodological reasons important to remember that the contemporary musicians performing among traditional folk music are all well trained professionals rauchan orazbaeva ramazan stamgazi
another very challenging aspect arises from the young composers generation and the rock and jazz musicians as they aim to incorporate their traditional heritage into the music they learned from the western cultures thus forming a new stage of ethnic contemporary classics respectively ethnic rock or jazz music that sounds distinctly kazakh for the classical sector outstanding aqtoty raimkulova turan ensemble for jazz magic of nomads for rock roksonaki urker ulytau alda span
