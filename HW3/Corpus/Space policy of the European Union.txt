a formal european space policy was established on 22 may 2007 when a joint and concomitant meeting at the ministerial level of the council of the european union and the council of the european space agency adopted a resolution on the european space policy the policy had been jointly drafted by the european commission and the director general of the european space agency this was the first common political framework for space activities established by the european union eucurrently each member state pursues their own national space policy though often co-ordinating through the independent european space agency esa enterprise and industry commissioner günter verheugen has stated that even though the eu is a world leader in the technology it is being put on the defensive by the us and russia and that it only has about a 10 year technological advantage on china and india which are racing to catch up


 the 2007 communication 
a communication outlining the policy was released on 26 april 2007 which set out orientations for
coordinating more effective civil space programmes between esa eu and their respective member states to ensure value for money and eliminate unnecessary duplication thus meeting shared european needs
developing and exploiting european space applications such as galileo and gmes global monitoring for the environment and security and satellite communication applications
preserving eu autonomous access to space
increasing synergy between defense and civil space programmes and technologies and pursue in particular interoperability of civilmilitary systems
ensuring that space policy is coherent with and supports the eus external relationships


 components of the policy 


 satellites 
the policy expresses support for an operational and autonomous global monitoring for environment and security gmes satellite capability before the end of 2008 and for a global navigation satellite system under european civil control ie the galileo positioning system


 galileo 

the european union has already started work on a project to create the galileo positioning system to break dependence on the united states gps system this is in cooperation with esa as well as other countries


 copernicus programme 

copernicus is a european system for monitoring the earth and consists of earth observation satellites and in situ sensors the program provides services in the thematic areas of land marine atmosphere climate change emergency management and security


 launch systems 
the policy emphasizes the importance for europe to maintain independent reliable and cost-effective access to space through european launch systems without mentioning any specifically by name the policy statement affirms support for the ec-esa framework agreement and the resolution on the evolution of the european launcher sector adopted in 2005


 sst 
the space surveillance and tracking support framework detects and warns against possible satellite collisions in space and monitors space debris re-entering earths atmosphere


 horizon 2020 
the horizon 2020 programme is the source of funding for a variety of projects such as

monitoring agricultural sustainability with sigma and agricab projects 
analyzing the chemical composition of earths oceans  ooss2015 
supporting urban planners in the coordination of city resources  decumanus 


 egnos 
the european geostationary navigation overlay service provides navigational assistance to aviation maritime and land-based users over most of europe the system supplements data from gps glonass and galileo by monitoring and making corrections to their positioning data


 iss 
the policy reaffirms a continuing european commitment to the international space station iss and describes esa participation in future international exploration programmes as being important


 science and technology 
the policy includes the goal of maintaining programmes that give europe a leading role in selected areas of science  it also calls for the development of technologies that allow european industry to avoid dependency on international suppliers


 why the eu needs a space policy 
the european union stated several reasons its space policy would be beneficial which include
meeting key societal challenges the space sector provides public services to everyone in the eu it can solve societal challenges such as climate change sustainable consumption of natural resources and safety and securityjobs and industrial growth the eu has over 230,000 jobs in the space sector it has a worth of over €50 billion pounds to the eu economyensuring eu autonomy by having access to space europe can stay competitive in business in security and form a stronger presence on the global stage


 implications of britain leaving the european union 
although britain is planning to withdraw its membership in the european union it still plans on keeping its membership as part of the european space agency members of the european space agency contribute funding based on percentage of gdp the uk is one of the larger members of the space agency and provides a significant amount of funding if britain maintains its membership of the european space agency after leaving the european union it is expected they will pay for membership possibly increasing the programs funding by more than a billion euros


 link between esa and eu 
the esa is an independent space agency and not under the jurisdiction of the european union although they have common goals share funding and work together often 
the first meeting of the two groups occurred on 22 may 2007 and the agencies have met multiple times since then the most recent meeting occurred in december 2016 the two groups signed a joint statement on their shared vision and commitment to the future of european space travel and reaffirmed their intentions to cooperate in the future
