 definition of independence 
whether the attainment of independence is different from revolution has long been contested and has often been debated over the question of violence as legitimate means to achieving sovereignty in general revolutions aim only to redistribute power with or without an element of emancipation such as in democratization within a state which as such may remain unaltered for example the mexican revolution 1917 chiefly refers to a multi-factional conflict that eventually led to a new constitution it has rarely been used to refer to the armed struggle 1821 against spain however some wars of independence have been described as revolutions such as the ones in the united states 1783 and indonesia 1949 while some revolutions that were specifically about a change in the political structure have resulted in breakaway states mongolia and finland for example gained their independence during the revolutions occurring in china 1911 and russia 1917 respectively causes for a country or province wishing to seek independence are many but most can be summed up as a feeling of inequality compared to the dominant power the means can extend from peaceful demonstrations like in the case of india 1947 to a violent war like in the case of algeria 1962


 distinction between independence and autonomy 
autonomy refers to a kind of independence which has been granted by an overseeing authority that itself still retains ultimate authority over that territory see devolution a protectorate refers to an autonomous region that depends upon a larger government for its protection as an autonomous region
