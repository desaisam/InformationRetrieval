 etymology 
according to the most popular and accepted version in 1499 an expedition led by alonso de ojeda visited the venezuelan coast the stilt houses in the area of lake maracaibo reminded the italian navigator amerigo vespucci of the city of venice italy so he named the region veneziola or little venice the spanish version of veneziola is venezuelamartín fernández de enciso a member of the vespucci and ojeda crew gave a different account in his work summa de geografía he states that the crew found indigenous people who called themselves the veneciuela thus the name venezuela may have evolved from the native wordpreviously the official name was estado de venezuela 1830–1856 república de venezuela 1856–1864 estados unidos de venezuela 1864–1953 and again república de venezuela 1953–1999


 history 


 pre-columbian history 

evidence exists of human habitation in the area now known as venezuela from about 15,000 years ago leaf-shaped tools from this period together with chopping and planoconvex scraping implements have been found exposed on the high riverine terraces of the rio pedregal in western venezuela late pleistocene hunting artifacts including spear tips have been found at a similar series of sites in northwestern venezuela known as el jobo according to radiocarbon dating these date from 13,000 to 7,000 bcit is not known how many people lived in venezuela before the spanish conquest it has been estimated at around one million in addition to indigenous peoples known today the population included historical groups such as the kalina caribs auaké caquetio mariche and timoto–cuicas the timoto–cuica culture was the most complex society in pre-columbian venezuela with pre-planned permanent villages surrounded by irrigated terraced fields they also stored water in tanks their houses were made primarily of stone and wood with thatched roofs they were peaceful for the most part and depended on growing crops regional crops included potatoes and ullucos they left behind works of art particularly anthropomorphic ceramics but no major monuments they spun vegetable fibers to weave into textiles and mats for housing they are credited with having invented the arepa a staple in venezuelan cuisine

after the conquest the population dropped markedly mainly through the spread of new infectious diseases from europe two main north-south axes of pre-columbian population were present who cultivated maize in the west and manioc in the east large parts of the llanos were cultivated through a combination of slash and burn and permanent settled agriculture


 colonization 

in 1498 during his third voyage to the americas christopher columbus sailed near the orinoco delta and landed in the gulf of paria amazed by the great offshore current of freshwater which deflected his course eastward columbus expressed in a letter to isabella and ferdinand that he must have reached heaven on earth terrestrial paradise

great signs are these of the terrestrial paradise for the site conforms to the opinion of the holy and wise theologians whom i have mentioned and likewise the other signs conform very well for i have never read or heard of such a large quantity of fresh water being inside and in such close proximity to salt water the very mild temperateness also corroborates this and if the water of which i speak does not proceed from paradise then it is an even greater marvel because i do not believe such a large and deep river has ever been known to exist in this world

spains colonization of mainland venezuela started in 1522 establishing its first permanent south american settlement in the present-day city of cumaná in the 16th century venezuela was contracted as a concession by the king of spain to the german welser banking family klein-venedig 1528–1546 native caciques leaders such as guaicaipuro c 1530–1568 and tamanaco died 1573 attempted to resist spanish incursions but the newcomers ultimately subdued them tamanaco was put to death by order of caracas founder diego de losadain the 16th century during the spanish colonization indigenous peoples such as many of the mariches themselves descendants of the kalina converted to roman catholicism some of the resisting tribes or leaders are commemorated in place names including caracas chacao and los teques the early colonial settlements focused on the northern coast but in the mid-18th century the spanish pushed farther inland along the orinoco river here the yekuana then known as the makiritare organized serious resistance in 1775 and 1776spains eastern venezuelan settlements were incorporated into new andalusia province administered by the royal audiencia of santo domingo from the early 16th century most of venezuela became part of the viceroyalty of new granada in the early 18th century and was then reorganized as an autonomous captaincy general starting in 1777 the town of caracas founded in the central coastal region in 1567 was well-placed to become a key location being near the coastal port of la guaira whilst itself being located in a valley in a mountain range providing defensive strength against pirates and a more fertile and healthy climate


 independence and 19th century 

after a series of unsuccessful uprisings venezuela under the leadership of francisco de miranda a venezuelan marshal who had fought in the american revolution and the french revolution declared independence on 5 july 1811 this began the venezuelan war of independence a devastating earthquake that struck caracas in 1812 together with the rebellion of the venezuelan llaneros helped bring down the first venezuelan republic a second venezuelan republic proclaimed on august 7 1813 lasted several months before being crushed as wellsovereignty was only attained after simón bolívar aided by josé antonio páez and antonio josé de sucre won the battle of carabobo on 24 june 1821 on 24 july 1823 josé prudencio padilla and rafael urdaneta helped seal venezuelan independence with their victory in the battle of lake maracaibo new granadas congress gave bolívar control of the granadian army leading it he liberated several countries and founded gran colombia

sucre who won many battles for bolívar went on to liberate ecuador and later become the second president of bolivia venezuela remained part of gran colombia until 1830 when a rebellion led by páez allowed the proclamation of a newly independent venezuela páez became the first president of the new republic between one-quarter and one-third of venezuelas population was lost during these two decades of warfare including perhaps one-half of the white population which by 1830 was estimated at about 800,000the colors of the venezuelan flag are yellow blue and red the yellow stands for land wealth the blue for the sea that separates venezuela from spain and the red for the blood shed by the heroes of independenceslavery in venezuela was abolished in 1854 much of venezuelas 19th-century history was characterized by political turmoil and dictatorial rule including the independence leader josé antonio páez who gained the presidency three times and served a total of 11 years between 1830 and 1863 this culminated in the federal war 1859–1863 a civil war in which hundreds of thousands died in a country with a population of not much more than a million people in the latter half of the century antonio guzmán blanco another caudillo served a total of 13 years between 1870 and 1887 with three other presidents interspersed

in 1895 a longstanding dispute with great britain about the territory of guayana esequiba which britain claimed as part of british guiana and venezuela saw as venezuelan territory erupted into the venezuela crisis of 1895 the dispute became a diplomatic crisis when venezuelas lobbyist william l scruggs sought to argue that british behavior over the issue violated the united states monroe doctrine of 1823 and used his influence in washington dc to pursue the matter then us president grover cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the doctrine that did not just simply forbid new european colonies but declared an american interest in any matter within the hemisphere britain ultimately accepted arbitration but in negotiations over its terms was able to persuade the us on many of the details a tribunal convened in paris in 1898 to decide the issue and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to british guianain 1899 cipriano castro assisted by his friend juan vicente gómez seized power in caracas marching an army from his base in the andean state of táchira castro defaulted on venezuelas considerable foreign debts and declined to pay compensation to foreigners caught up in venezuelas civil wars this led to the venezuela crisis of 1902–1903 in which britain germany and italy imposed a naval blockade of several months before international arbitration at the new permanent court of arbitration in the hague was agreed in 1908 another dispute broke out with the netherlands which was resolved when castro left for medical treatment in germany and was promptly overthrown by juan vicente gómez 1908–1935


 20th century 

the discovery of massive oil deposits in lake maracaibo during world war i proved to be pivotal for venezuela and transformed the basis of its economy from a heavy dependence on agricultural exports it prompted an economic boom that lasted into the 1980s by 1935 venezuelas per capita gross domestic product was latin americas highest gómez benefited handsomely from this as corruption thrived but at the same time the new source of income helped him centralize the venezuelan state and develop its authority
he remained the most powerful man in venezuela until his death in 1935 although at times he ceded the presidency to others the gomecista dictatorship 1935–1945 system largely continued under eleazar lópez contreras but from 1941 under isaías medina angarita was relaxed  angarita granted a range of reforms including the legalization of all political parties after world war ii immigration from southern europe mainly from spain italy portugal and france and poorer latin american countries markedly diversified venezuelan society

in 1945 a civilian-military coup overthrew medina angarita and ushered in a three-year period of democratic rule 1945–1948 under the mass membership party democratic action initially under rómulo betancourt until rómulo gallegos won the venezuelan presidential election 1947 generally believed to be the first free and fair elections in venezuela gallegos governed until overthrown by a military junta led by the triumvirate luis felipe llovera páez marcos pérez jiménez and gallegos defense minister carlos delgado chalbaud in the 1948 venezuelan coup détat
the most powerful man in the military junta 1948–1958 was pérez jiménez though chalbaud was its titular president and was suspected of being behind the death in office of chalbaud who died in a bungled kidnapping in 1950 when the junta unexpectedly lost the election it held in 1952 it ignored the results and pérez jiménez was installed as president where he remained until 1958 the expansion of the venezuelan economy in this period was based on the indebtedness of the venezuelan nation and that was one of the causes of the economic crisis in venezuela in the 1960s in which important projects such as the urban center el recreo de marcel brauer on avenida casanova in sabana grande district were paralyzedduring the years of pérez jiménezs administration the state intervened in areas of the economy that were traditionally carried out by private companies the pérez jiménez government was characterized by its state capitalism and not by liberal capitalism it was an antecedent of the populist and paternalistic economic regime of the later democratic regimes the national private entrepreneurship increasingly had less space to grow and prosper the state was the great capitalist in the venezuela of pérez jiménez and was the largest national shareholder of major hotel chains such as sheratonin the government of pérez jiménez venezuelas debt grew more than 25 times and went from 175 million to more than 4,500 million bolivares in just 5 years approximately 15 billion dollars in 2018 the malaise over the debts of venezuela reached the barracks and the national business pérez jiménez responded that there is no debt but commitments the finance minister failed to convince pérez jiménez to order the cancellation of debts as of 14 january 1958 the venezuelan business community decided to divorce itself completely from the regime nine days before the collapse of the government the military dictator pérez jiménez was forced out on 23 january 1958 in an effort to consolidate a young democracy the three major political parties acción democrática ad copei and unión republicana democrática urd with the notable exception of the communist party of venezuela signed the puntofijo pact power-sharing agreement the two first parties would dominate the political landscape for four decades

during the presidencies of rómulo ernesto betancourt bello 1959–1964 his second time and raúl leoni otero 1964–1969 in the 1960s substantial guerilla movements occurred including the armed forces of national liberation and the revolutionary left movement which had split from ad in 1960 most of these movements laid down their arms under rafael calderas first presidency 1969–1974 caldera had won the 1968 election for copei being the first time a party other than democratic action took the presidency through a democratic election the new democratic order had its antagonists betancourt suffered an attack planned by the dominican dictator rafael trujillo in 1960 and the leftists excluded from the pact initiated an armed insurgency by organizing themselves in the armed forces of national liberation sponsored by the communist party and fidel castro in 1962 they tried to destabilize the military corps with failed revolts in carúpano and puerto cabello at the same time betancourt promoted an international doctrine in which he only recognized elected governments by popular voteas a result of the debt that marcos pérez jiménez had left an economic adjustment program was necessary in venezuela the economic recovery plan of 1960 was formulated by tomás enrique carrillo batalla the construction industry was revitalized through the rediscount of the central bank of venezuela the economic recovery plan fulfilled its objectives and in 1964 venezuela was able to return to an anchored exchange rate with free purchase and sale of foreign currency this system lasted until the venezuelan black friday of 1983 although the model was already running out at the end of the seventies the consolidation of the democratic system and the dissipation of fears of political radicalization of the country contributed to normalize the demand for foreign currency stabilizing the parallel exchange rate
for much of the period between 1950 and 1973 the venezuelan economy was characterized by its stability and sustained strength factors that contributed decisively to being able to maintain a fixed exchange rate without major inconveniences in the period of carlos andrés pérez 1974–1979 his first time as president as a result of the arab-israeli war the yom kippur war the average price of a barrel of oil went from 3.71 to 10.53 dollars and continued to rise to exceed 29 dollars in 1981 the income of the public sector went from 18,960 million bolivars in 1973 to 45.564 million in 1974 the economic bonanza also had the characteristics of an economic bubble but venezuelans remember the ta barato dame dos the increased inflow of funds to savings and loan entities and mortgage banks allowed an increase in the mortgage loan portfolio which also tripled in general venezuela was a prosperous country in the governments of rómulo betancourt 1945 – c 1948 1959–1964 rafael caldera 1969–1974 1994 – c 1999 and carlos andrés pérez 1974–1979 1989 – c 1993 in 1975 the iron industry was nationalized and the following year the oil industry creating petróleos de venezuela sa pdvsa both caldera and pérez partially broke with the betancourt doctrine

the election in 1973 of carlos andrés pérez coincided with an oil crisis in which venezuelas income exploded as oil prices soared oil industries were nationalized in 1976 this led to massive increases in public spending but also increases in external debts which continued into the 1980s when the collapse of oil prices during the 1980s crippled the venezuelan economy as the government started to devalue the currency in february 1983 to face its financial obligations venezuelans real standards of living fell dramatically a number of failed economic policies and increasing corruption in government led to rising poverty and crime worsening social indicators and increased political instabilityduring the presidency of luis herrera campins 1979–1984 important infrastructure works were completed such as the parque central complex which became the largest housing complex and the tallest towers in latin america teresa carreño cultural complex the largest cultural center in south america at that time the brígido iriarte stadium and the united nations park most of these works had been previously planned until the mid-eighties the venezuelan economy showed a very positive behavior characterized by the absence of internal or external imbalances high economic growth largely due to the sustained and very high gross fixed investment of those years 10 under unemployment and great price stability this translated into sustained increases in the average real wage and an improvement in the condition of life

in 1983 the bolivar was devalued on black friday unleashing a strong economic crisis which hit investments in the most important financial centers of the venezuelan capital such as sabana grande in the government of jaime lusinchi 1984–1989 an attempt was made to solve the problem unfortunately the measures failed after a long period of accelerated economic expansion that lasts for six decades value of the stock of homes by families an extreme higher value is reached towards 1982 from this historical value begins then a systematic fall that mounts to 26 hundred up to 2006 and that configures a genuine unique experience in contemporary economic life however the economic deactivation of the country had begun to show its first signs in 1978in the 1980s the presidential commission for state reform copre emerged as a mechanism of political innovation venezuela was preparing for the decentralization of its political system and the diversification of its economy reducing the large size of the state the copre operated as an innovation mechanism also by incorporating issues into the political agenda that were generally excluded from public deliberation by the main actors of the venezuelan democratic system the most discussed topics were incorporated into the public agenda decentralization political participation municipalization judicial oder reforms and the role of the state in a new economic strategy unfortunately the social reality of the country made the changes difficult to applyeconomic crises in the 1980s and 1990s led to a political crisis in which hundreds died in the caracazo riots of 1989 during the presidency of carlos andres pérez 1989–1993 his second time two attempted coups détat in 1992 february and november by hugo chávez and the impeachment of president carlos andrés pérez re-elected in 1988 for corruption in 1993 and the interin presidency of ramón josé velásquez 1993–1994 coup leader hugo chávez was pardoned in march 1994 by president rafael caldera 1994–1999 his second time with a clean slate and his political rights reinstated this let him later get the presidency continuously from 1999 until his death in 2013 winning the elections of 1998 2000 2006 and 2012 and the presidential referendum of 2004 with the only exception in 2002 of pedro carmona estanga as a two-day de facto government and diosdado cabello rondón as a few-hours interim president


 bolivarian government 1999–present 

the bolivarian revolution refers to a left-wing populism social movement and political process in venezuela led by the late venezuelan president hugo chávez who founded the fifth republic movement in 1997 and the united socialist party of venezuela in 2007 the bolivarian revolution is named after simón bolívar an early 19th-century venezuelan and latin american revolutionary leader prominent in the spanish american wars of independence in achieving the independence of most of northern south america from spanish rule according to chávez and other supporters the bolivarian revolution seeks to build a mass movement to implement bolivarianism—popular democracy economic independence equitable distribution of revenues and an end to political corruption—in venezuela they interpret bolívars ideas from a populist perspective using socialist rhetoric


 hugo chávez 1999–2013 

a collapse in confidence in the existing parties led to chávez being elected president in 1998 and the subsequent launch of a bolivarian revolution beginning with a 1999 constituent assembly to write a new constitution of venezuela chávez also initiated bolivarian missions programs aimed at helping the poorin april 2002 chávez was briefly ousted from power in the 2002 venezuelan coup détat attempt following popular demonstrations by his opponents but he returned to power after two days as a result of demonstrations by poor chávez supporters in caracas and actions by the militarychávez also remained in power after an all-out national strike that lasted from december 2002 to february 2003 including a strikelockout in the state oil company pdvsa the strike produced severe economic dislocation with the countrys gdp falling 27% during the first four months of 2003 and costing the oil industry 13.3 billion capital flight before and during the strike led to the reimposition of currency controls which had been abolished in 1989 managed by the cadivi agency in the subsequent decade the government was forced into several currency devaluations these devaluations have done little to improve the situation of the venezuelan people who rely on imported products or locally produced products that depend on imported inputs while dollar-denominated oil sales account for the vast majority of venezuelas exports according to sebastian boyd writing at bloomberg news the profits of the oil industry have been lost to social engineering and corruption instead of investments needed to maintain oil productionchávez survived several further political tests including an august 2004 recall referendum he was elected for another term in december 2006 and re-elected for a third term in october 2012 however he was never sworn in for his third period due to medical complications chávez died on 5 march 2013 after a nearly two-year fight with cancer the presidential election that took place on sunday 14 april 2013 was the first since chávez took office in 1999 in which his name did not appear on the ballot
