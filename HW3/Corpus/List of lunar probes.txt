† means tentatively identified as classified by nasa 1 these are cold war-era soviet missions mostly failures about which few or no details have been officially released the information given may be speculative
date is the date ofclosest encounter flybys
impact impactors
orbital insertion to end of mission whether planned or premature orbiters
landing to end of mission whether planned or premature landers
launch missions that never got underway due to failure at or soon after launch
in cases which do not fit any of the above the event to which the date refers is stated note that as a result of this scheme missions are not always listed in order of launchin the case of flybys such as gravity assists that are incidental to the main mission success indicates the successful completion of the flyby not necessarily that of the main mission
