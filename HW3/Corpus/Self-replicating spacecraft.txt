the idea of self-replicating spacecraft has been applied – in theory – to several distinct tasks the particular variant of this idea applied to the idea of space exploration is known as a von neumann probe after being conceived by mathematician john von neumann other variants include the berserker and an automated terraforming seeder ship


 theory 
von neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by self-replicating spacecraft taking advantage of their exponential growth in theory a self-replicating spacecraft could be sent to a neighbouring planetary system where it would seek out raw materials extracted from asteroids moons gas giants etc to create replicas of itself these replicas would then be sent out to other planetary systems the original parent probe could then pursue its primary purpose within the star system this mission varies widely depending on the variant of self-replicating starship proposed
given this pattern and its similarity to the reproduction patterns of bacteria it has been pointed out that von neumann machines might be considered a form of life in his short story lungfish see self-replicating machines in fiction david brin touches on this idea pointing out that self-replicating machines launched by different species might actually compete with one another in a darwinistic fashion for raw material or even have conflicting missions given enough variety of species they might even form a type of ecology or – should they also have a form of artificial intelligence – a society they may even mutate with untold thousands of generations
the first quantitative engineering analysis of such a spacecraft was published in 1980 by robert freitas in which the non-replicating project daedalus design was modified to include all subsystems necessary for self-replication the designs strategy was to use the probe to deliver a seed factory with a mass of about 443 tons to a distant site have the seed factory replicate many copies of itself there to increase its total manufacturing capacity over a 500-year period and then use the resulting automated industrial complex to construct more probes with a single seed factory on board each
it has been theorized that a self-replicating starship utilizing relatively conventional theoretical methods of interstellar travel ie no exotic faster-than-light propulsion and speeds limited to an average cruising speed of 0.1c could spread throughout a galaxy the size of the milky way in as little as half a million years


 implications for fermis paradox 
in 1981 frank tipler put forth an argument that extraterrestrial intelligences do not exist based on the absence of von neumann probes given even a moderate rate of replication and the history of the galaxy such probes should already be common throughout space and thus we should have already encountered them because we have not this shows that extraterrestrial intelligences do not exist this is thus a resolution to the fermi paradox – that is the question of why we have not already encountered extraterrestrial intelligence if it is common throughout the universe
a response came from carl sagan and william newman now known as sagans response it pointed out that in fact tipler had underestimated the rate of replication and that von neumann probes should have already started to consume most of the mass in the galaxy any intelligent race would therefore sagan and newman reasoned not design von neumann probes in the first place and would try to destroy any von neumann probes found as soon as they were detected as robert freitas has pointed out the assumed capacity of von neumann probes described by both sides of the debate are unlikely in reality and more modestly reproducing systems are unlikely to be observable in their effects on our solar system or the galaxy as a whole
another objection to the prevalence of von neumann probes is that civilizations of the type that could potentially create such devices may have inherently short lifetimes and self-destruct before so advanced a stage is reached through such events as biological or nuclear warfare nanoterrorism resource exhaustion ecological catastrophe or pandemics
simple workarounds exist to avoid the over-replication scenario radio transmitters or other means of wireless communication could be used by probes programmed not to replicate beyond a certain density such as five probes per cubic parsec or arbitrary limit such as ten million within one century analogous to the hayflick limit in cell reproduction  one problem with this defence against uncontrolled replication is that it would only require a single probe to malfunction and begin unrestricted reproduction for the entire approach to fail – essentially a technological cancer – unless each probe also has the ability to detect such malfunction in its neighbours and implements a seek and destroy protocol which in turn could lead to probe-on-probe space wars if faulty probes first managed to multiply to high numbers before they were found by sound ones which could then well have programming to replicate to matching numbers so as to manage the infestation  another workaround is based on the need for spacecraft heating during long interstellar travel  the use of plutonium as a thermal source would limit the ability to self-replicate  the spacecraft would have no programming to make more plutonium even if it found the required raw materials  another is to program the spacecraft with a clear understanding of the dangers of uncontrolled replication


 applications for self-replicating spacecraft 
the details of the mission of self-replicating starships can vary widely from proposal to proposal and the only common trait is the self-replicating nature


 von neumann probes 
a von neumann probe is a spacecraft capable of replicating itself the concept is named after hungarian american mathematician and physicist john von neumann who rigorously studied the concept of self-replicating machines that he called universal assemblers and which are often referred to as von neumann machinesif a self-replicating probe finds evidence of primitive life or a primitive low-level culture it might be programmed to lie dormant silently observe attempt to make contact this variant is known as a bracewell probe or even interfere with or guide the evolution of life in some way
physicist paul davies of arizona state university has even raised the possibility of a probe resting on our own moon having arrived at some point in earths ancient prehistory and remained to monitor earth which is very reminiscent of arthur c clarkes the sentinel and the stanley kubrick film 2001 a space odyssey
a variant idea on the interstellar von neumann probe idea is that of the astrochicken proposed by freeman dyson while it has the common traits of self-replication exploration and communication with its home base dyson conceived the astrochicken to explore and operate within our own planetary system and not explore interstellar space
oxford-based philosopher nick bostrom discusses the idea that future powerful superintelligences will create efficient cost-effective space travel and interstellar von neumann probesanders sandberg and stuart armstrong argued that launching the colonization of the entire reachable universe through self-replicating probes is well within the capabilities of a star-spanning civilization and proposed a theoretical approach for achieving it in 32 years by mining planet mercury for resources and constructing a dyson swarm around the sun


 berserkers 
a variant of the self-replicating starship is the berserker unlike the benign probe concept berserkers are programmed to seek out and exterminate lifeforms and life-bearing exoplanets whenever they are encountered
the name is derived from the berserker series of novels by fred saberhagen which describe a war between humanity and such machines saberhagen points out through one of his characters that the berserker warships in his novels are not von neumann machines themselves but the larger complex of berserker machines – including automated shipyards – do constitute a von neumann machine this again brings up the concept of an ecology of von neumann machines or even a von neumann hive entity
it is speculated in fiction that berserkers could be created and launched by a xenophobic civilization see anvil of stars by greg bear in the section in fiction below or could theoretically mutate from a more benign probe for instance a von neumann ship designed for terraforming processes – mining a planets surface and adjusting its atmosphere to more human-friendly conditions – might malfunction and attack inhabited planets killing their inhabitants in the process of changing the planetary environment and then self-replicate and dispatch more ships to attack other planets


 replicating seeder ships 
yet another variant on the idea of the self-replicating starship is that of the seeder ship such starships might store the genetic patterns of lifeforms from their home world perhaps even of the species which created it upon finding a habitable exoplanet or even one that might be terraformed it would try to replicate such lifeforms – either from stored embryos or from stored information using molecular nanotechnology to build zygotes with varying genetic information from local raw materialssuch ships might be terraforming vessels preparing colony worlds for later colonization by other vessels or – should they be programmed to recreate raise and educate individuals of the species that created it – self-replicating colonizers themselves seeder ships would be a suitable alternative to generation ships as a way to colonize worlds too distant to travel to in one lifetime


 in fiction 


 von neumann probes 
2001 a space odyssey the monoliths in arthur c clarkes book and stanley kubricks film 2001 a space odyssey were intended to be self-replicating probes though the artifacts in the sentinel clarkes original short story upon which 2001 was based were not  the film was to begin with a series of scientists explaining how probes like these would be the most efficient method of exploring outer space kubrick cut the opening segment from his film at the last minute however and these monoliths became almost mystical entities in both the film and clarkes novelcold as ice in the novel by charles sheffield there is a segment where the author a physicist describes von neumann machines harvesting sulfur nitrogen phosphorus helium-4 and various metals from the atmosphere of jupiterdestinys road larry niven frequently refers to von neumann probes in many of his works in his 1998 book destinys road von neumann machines are scattered throughout the human colony world destiny and its moon quicksilver in order to build and maintain technology and to make up for the lack of the resident humans technical knowledge the von neumann machines primarily construct a stretchable fabric cloth capable of acting as a solar collector which serves as the humans primary energy source the von neumann machines also engage in ecological maintenance and other exploratory workno mans sky in the video game no mans sky mysterious probes called sentinels roam all the planets in the entire galaxy analyzing the fauna and flora and protecting them from extinction it is likely these probes have self-replicated for centuries and managed to spread through the galaxythe devils blind spot see also alexander kluge the devils blind spot new directions 2004spin in the novel by robert charles wilson earth is veiled by a temporal field humanity tries to understand and escape this field by using von neumann probes it is later revealed that the field itself was generated by von neumann probes from another civilization and that a competition for resources had taken place between earths and the aliens probesthe third millennium a history of the world ad 2000-3000 in the book by brian stableford and david langford published by alfred a knopf inc 1985 humanity sends cycle-limited von neumann probes out to the nearest stars to do open-ended exploration and to announce humanitys existence to whoever might encounter themvon neumanns war in von neumanns war by john ringo and travis s taylor published by baen books in 2007 von neumann probes arrive in the solar system moving in from the outer planets and converting all metals into gigantic structures eventually they arrive on earth wiping out much of the population before being beaten back when humanity reverse engineers some of the probesgrey goo in the video game grey goo the goo faction is composed entirely of von neumann probes sent through various microscopic wormholes to map the milky way galaxy the factions units are configurations of nanites used during their original mission of exploration which have adapted to a combat role the goo starts as an antagonist to the human and beta factions but their true objective is revealed during their portion of the single-player campaign related to and inspired by the grey goo doomsday scenariowe are legion we are bob by dennis e taylor bob johansson the former owner of a software company dies in a car accident only to wake up a hundred years later as a computer emulation of bob given a von neumann probe by americas religious replacement he is sent out to explore exploit expand and experiment for the good of the human race


 berserkers 
in the science fiction short story collection berserker by fred saberhagen a series of short stories include accounts of battles fought against extremely destructive berserker machines this and subsequent books set in the same fictional universe are the origin of the term berserker probein the 2003 miniseries reboot of battlestar galactica and the subsequent 2004 series the cylons are similar to berserkers in their wish to destroy human life they were created by humans in a group of fictional planets called the twelve colonies the cylons created special models that look like humans in order to destroy the twelve colonies and later the fleeing fleet of surviving humansthe borg of star trek – a self-replicating bio-mechanical race that is dedicated to the task of achieving perfection through the assimilation of useful technology and lifeforms their ships are massive mechanical cubes a close step from the berserkers massive mechanical spheresscience fiction author larry niven later borrowed this notion in his short story a teardrop fallsin the computer game star control ii the slylandro probe is an out-of-control self-replicating probe that attacks starships of other races they were not originally intended to be a berserker probe they sought out intelligent life for peaceful contact but due to a programming error they would immediately switch to resource extraction mode and attempt to dismantle the target ship for raw materials while the plot claims that the probes reproduce at a geometric rate the game itself caps the frequency of encountering these probes it is possible to deal with the menace in a side-quest but this is not necessary to complete the game as the probes only appear one at a time and the players ship will eventually be fast and powerful enough to outrun them or destroy them for resources – although the probes will eventually dominate the entire game universein iain banks novel excession hegemonising swarms are described as a form of outside context problem an example of an aggressive hegemonising swarm object is given as an uncontrolled self-replicating probe with the goal of turning all matter into copies of itself  after causing great damage they are somehow transformed using unspecified techniques by the zetetic elench and become evangelical hegemonising swarm objects such swarms referred to as smatter reappear in the later novels surface detail which features scenes of space combat against the swarms and the hydrogen sonatathe inhibitors from alastair reynolds revelation space series are self-replicating machines whose purpose is to inhibit the development of intelligent star-faring cultures  they are dormant for extreme periods of time until they detect the presence of a space-faring culture and proceed to exterminate it even to the point of sterilizing entire planets  they are very difficult to destroy as they seem to have faced every type of weapon ever devised and only need a short time to remember the necessary counter-measuresalso from alastair reynolds books the greenfly terraforming machines are another form of berserker machines for unknown reasons but probably an error in their programming they destroy planets and turn them into trillions of domes filled with vegetation – after all their purpose is to produce a habitable environment for humans however in doing so they inadvertently decimate the human race by 10,000 they have wiped out most of the galaxythe reapers in the video game series mass effect are also self-replicating probes bent on destroying any advanced civilization encountered in the galaxy they lie dormant in the vast spaces between the galaxies and follow a cycle of extermination it is seen in mass effect 2 that they assimilate any advanced speciesmantrid drones from the science fiction television series lexx were an extremely aggressive type of self-replicating berserker machine eventually converting the majority of the matter in the universe into copies of themselves in the course of their quest to thoroughly exterminate humanitythe babylon 5 episode infection showed a smaller scale berserker in the form of the icarran war machine after being created with the goal of defeating an unspecified enemy faction the war machines proceeded to exterminate all life on the planet icarra vii because they had been programmed with standards for what constituted a pure icaran based on religious teachings which no actual icaran could satisfy because the icaran were pre-starflight the war machines became dormant after completing their task rather than spreading one unit was reactivated on-board babylon 5 after being smuggled past quarantine by an unscrupulous archaeologist but after being confronted with how they had rendered icara vii a dead world the simulated personality of the war machine committed suicidethe babylon 5 episode a day in the strife features a probe that threatens the station with destruction unless a series of questions designed to test a civilizations level of advancement are answered correctly the commander of the station correctly surmises that the probe is actually a berserker and that if the questions are answered the probe would identify them as a threat to its originating civilization and detonategreg bears novel the forge of god deals directly with the concept of berserker von neumann probes and their consequences  the idea is further explored in the novels sequel anvil of stars which explores the reaction other civilizations have to the creation and release of berserkersin gregory benfords galactic center saga series an antagonist berserker machine race is encountered by earth first as a probe in in the ocean of night and then in an attack in across the sea of suns  the berserker machines do not seek to completely eradicate a race if merely throwing it into a primitive low technological state will do as they did to the ems encountered in across the sea of suns  the alien machine watchers would not be considered von neumann machines themselves but the collective machine race couldon stargate sg-1 the replicators were a vicious race of insect-like robots that were originally created by an android named reese to serve as toys they grew beyond her control and began evolving eventually spreading throughout at least two galaxies in addition to ordinary autonomous evolution they were able to analyze and incorporate new technologies they encountered into themselves ultimately making them one of the most advanced races knownon stargate atlantis a second race of replicators created by the ancients were encountered in the pegasus galaxy they were created as a means to defeat the wraith the ancients attempted to destroy them after they began showing signs of sentience and requested that their drive to kill the wraith be removed this failed and an unspecified length of time after the ancients retreated to the milky way galaxy the replicators nearly succeeded in destroying the wraith the wraith were able to hack into the replicators and deactivate the extermination drive at which point they retreated to their home world and were not heard from again until encountered by the atlantis expedition after the atlantis expedition reactivated this dormant directive the replicators embarked on a plan to kill the wraith by removing their food source ie all humans in the pegasus galaxyin stargate universe season 2 a galaxy billions of light years distant from the milky way is infested with drone ships that are programmed to annihilate intelligent life and advanced technology the drone ships attack other space ships including destiny as well as humans on planetary surfaces but dont bother destroying primitive technology such as buildings unless they are harboring intelligent life or advanced technologyin the justice league unlimited episode dark heart an alien weapon based on this same idea lands on earthin the homeworld cataclysm video game

the players ships  the probes then return to the mothership returning the consumed material  if probes are destroyed the mothership will create new ones  if all the players ships are destroyed the von neumann probes will reduce the planets resource levels before leaving  the probes appear as blue octahedrons with small spheres attached to the apical points  the mothership is a larger version of the probes in the 2008 expansion a murder of crows kerberos productions also introduces the vn berserker a combat oriented ship which attacks player planets and ships in retaliation to violence against vn

the reason there is no evidence of the race is because of the nano-machines themselves and their ability to manipulate matter at an atomic level it is even suggested that viruses could be ancient nano machines that have evolved over time


 replicating seeder ships 
code of the lifemaker by james p hogan describes the evolution of a society of humanoid-like robots who inhabit saturns moon titan the sentient machines are descended from an unmanned factory ship that was to be self replicating but suffered radiation damage and went off course eventually landing on titan around 1,000,000 bcmanifold space stephen baxters novel starts with the discovery of alien self-replicating machines active within the solar systemin the metroid prime subseries of games the massive leviathans are probes routinely sent out from the planet phaaze to infect other planets with phazon radiation and eventually turn these planets into clones of phaaze where the self-replication process can continuein david brins short story collection the river of time 1986 the short story lungfish prominently features von neumann probes not only does he explore the concept of the probes themselves but indirectly explores the ideas of competition between different designs of probes evolution of von neumann probes in the face of such competition and the development of a type of ecology between von neumann probes one of the vessels mentioned is clearly a seeder typein the songs of distant earth by arthur c clarke humanity on a future earth facing imminent destruction creates automated seedships that act as fire and forget lifeboats aimed at distant habitable worlds upon landing the ship begins to create new humans from stored genetic information and an onboard computer system raises and trains the first few generations of new inhabitants the massive ships are then broken down and used as building materials by their childrenon the stargate atlantis episode remnants the atlantis team finds an ancient probe that they later learn was launched by a now-extinct technologically advanced race in order to seed new worlds and re-propagate their silicon-based species the probe communicated with inhabitants of atlantis by means of hallucinationson the stargate sg-1 episode scorched earth a species of newly relocated humanoids face extinction via an automated terraforming colony seeder ship controlled by an artificial intelligenceon stargate universe the human adventurers live on a ship called destiny its mission was to connect a network of stargates placed by preceding seeder ships on planets capable of supporting life to allow instantaneous travel between themthe trilogy of albums which conclude the comic book series storm by don lawrence starting with chronicles of pandarve 11 the von neumann machine is based on self-replicating conscious machines containing the sum of all human knowledge employed to rebuild human society throughout the universe in case of disaster on earth the probe malfunctions and although new probes are built they do not separate from the motherprobe which eventually results in a cluster of malfunctioning probes so big that it can absorb entire moonshumanity in xeno series is creation of rogue seeder so technically it is also berserker known as deus
