 1783–1853 

the 1783 treaty of paris with great britain defined the original borders of the united states it generally stretched from the eastern seaboard to the mississippi river in the west  there were ambiguities in the treaty regarding the exact border with canada to the north that led to disputes that were resolved by the webster–ashburton treaty in 1842  beginning in the late 18th century the new nation organized areas west of the original thirteen states into several united states territories setting a template for future expansion


 louisiana purchase 
the louisiana purchase in 1803 was negotiated with napoleon during thomas jeffersons presidency the territory was acquired from france for 15 million equivalent to 251 million in present-day terms a small portion of this land was ceded to britain in 1818 in exchange for the red river basin more of this land was ceded to spain in 1819 with the florida purchase but was later reacquired through the texas annexation and mexican cession


 west florida 
west florida was declared to be a us possession in 1810 by president james madison after the territory had declared its independence from spain madison ordered the us army to take control six weeks later the army entered and occupied the capital st francisville putting an end to the republic after 74 days of independence spain did not relinquish its claim to sovereignty see west florida controversy until ratification of the adams–onís treaty general andrew jackson personally accepted the delivery of west florida from its spanish governor on july 17 1821


 red river

webster-ashburton treaty of 1842 with britain split the disputed territory in maine and new brunswick and finalized the border with canada including the disputed indian stream territory in 1850 britain ceded to the us less than one acre of underwater rock horseshoe reef in lake erie near buffalo for a lighthouse


 texas 
texas annexation of 1845 the independent republic of texas long sought to join the us despite mexican claims and the warning by mexican leader antonio lópez de santa anna that this would be equivalent to a declaration of war against the mexican republic congress approved the annexation of texas on february 28 1845 on december 29 1845 texas became the 28th state texas had claimed new mexico east of the rio grande but had only made one unsuccessful attempt to occupy it new mexico was captured by the us army in august 1846 and then administered separately from texas mexico acknowledged the loss of territory in the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo of 1848


 oregon territory 
oregon country the territory of north america west of the rockies to the pacific was jointly controlled by the us and britain following the anglo-american convention of 1818 until june 15 1846 when the oregon treaty divided the territory at the 49th parallel see oregon boundary dispute the san juan islands were claimed and jointly occupied by the us and the uk from 1846–72 due to ambiguities in the treaty see northwestern boundary dispute arbitration led to the sole us possession of the san juan islands since 1872


 mexican cession 
mexican cession lands were captured in the mexican–american war in 1846–48 and ceded by mexico in the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo where mexico agreed to the present mexico–united states border except for the later gadsden purchase the united states paid 15 million equivalent to 403 million in present-day terms and agreed to pay claims made by american citizens against mexico which amounted to more than 3 million equivalent to 81 million today


 gadsden purchase 
in the gadsden purchase of 1853 the united states purchased a strip of land along the mexico–united states border for 10 million equivalent to 301 million in present-day terms now in new mexico and arizona the territory was also bought as americans were passing through the land west to california  after the american mexican war over the dispute of border claims american bought the land to prevent future conflict  few historians would argue the territory was intended for a southern transcontinental railroad


 since 1853 


 alaska 
alaska purchase from the russian empire for 7.2 million 2 cents per acre on march 30 1867 equivalent to 129 million in present-day terms as a vital refueling station for ships trading with asia the land went through several administrative changes before becoming an organized territory on may 11 1912 and the 49th state of the us on january 3 1959


 hawaii 
the kingdom of hawaii was closely linked by missionary work and trade to the us by the 1880s in 1893 business leaders overthrew the queen of hawaii and sought annexation president grover cleveland strongly disapproved so hawaii set up an independent republic the republic of hawaii southern democrats in congress strongly opposed a non-white addition president william mckinley a republican secured a congressional resolution in 1898 and the small republic joined the us all its citizens became full us citizens one factor was the need for advanced naval bases to fend off japanese ambitions the hawaiian islands officially became an incorporated territory of the us in 1900 following 94% voter approval of the admission of hawaii act on august 21 1959 the territory of hawaii became the state of hawaii the 50th state
with hawaii came two remote coral atolls the palmyra atoll which had been annexed by the us in 1859 abandoned then claimed in 1862 by the kingdom of hawaii and the stewart islands which had joined the kingdom a few years before palmyra  at hawaiian statehood in 1959 palmyra and arguably the stewarts were excluded from the new state  palmyra remained an incorporated us territory while the stewarts were claimed and are now controlled by the solomon islands


 spanish colonies 

puerto rico guam and the philippines for which the united states compensated spain 20 million equivalent to 602 million in present-day terms were ceded by spain after the spanish–american war in the 1898 treaty of paris spain relinquished all claim of sovereignty over cuba but did not cede it to the united states so it became a protectorate all four of these areas were under united states military government usmg for extended periods cuba became an independent nation in 1902 and the philippines became an independent nation in 1946
this era also saw the first scattered protests against american imperialism noted americans such as mark twain spoke out forcefully against these ventures opponents of the war including twain and andrew carnegie organized themselves into the american anti-imperialist league
during this same period the american people continued to strongly chastise the european powers for their imperialism the second boer war was especially unpopular in the united states and soured anglo-american relations the anti-imperialist press would often draw parallels between the us in the philippines and the british in the second boer war


 cuba 
under the 1898 treaty of paris spain relinquished all claim of sovereignty over and title to cuba with the island to be occupied by the united states under the teller amendment congress had already decided against annexation cuba gained formal independence on 20 may 1902 under the new cuban constitution however the us retained the right to intervene in cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations through the platt amendment this however was later renounced as part of franklin roosevelts good neighbor policy under the platt amendment 1901 cuba also agreed to lease to the us the naval base at guantánamo bay
the naval base occupies land which the united states leased from cuba in 1903  for the time required for the purposes of coaling and naval stations  the two governments later agreed that so long hey the united states of america shall not abandon the said naval station of guantanamo or the two governments shall not agree to a modification of its present limits the station shall continue to have the territorial area that it now has with the limits that it has on the date of the signature of the present treaty


 puerto rico

 guam 
in guam settlement by foreign ethnic groups was small at first after world war ii showed the strategic value of the island construction of a huge military base began along with a large influx of people from other parts of the world guam today has a very mixed population of 164,000 the indigenous chamorros make up 37% of the population the rest of the population consists mostly of white americans and filipinos with smaller groups of chinese japanese koreans micronesians vietnamese and indians guam today is almost totally americanized the situation is somewhat similar to that in hawaii but attempts to change guams status as an unincorporated us territory have yet to meet with success


 philippines 

the philippine revolution against spain began in april 1896 the spanish–american war came to the philippines on may 1 1898 when the united states navys asiatic squadron commanded by commodore george dewey defeated the spanish pacific squadron under admiral patricio montojo y pasarón during the battle of manila bay on june 12 philippine revolutionaries declared independence and establishment of the first philippine republic on december 10 1898 the treaty of paris which ended the spanish–american war was signed the treaty transferred control of the philippines from spain to the united states this agreement was not recognized by the philippine revolutionaries who declared war against the united states on june 2 1899 the philippine–american war ensued in 1901 emilio aguinaldo president of the malolos republic was captured and pledged his allegiance to the american government the us unilaterally declared an end to the conflict in 1902 scattered fighting continued however until 1913
the philippine organic act of 1902 provided for the establishment of a bicameral legislature composed of an upper house consisting of the philippine commission an appointed body with both american and filipino members and a popularly elected lower house the philippine assembly the philippines became a us colony in the fashion of europes new imperialism with benevolent colonial practices english joined spanish as an official language and english language education was made compulsory in 1916 the united states passed the philippine autonomy act and committed itself to granting independence to the philippines as soon as a stable government can be established therein as a step to full independence in 1946 partial autonomy as a commonwealth was granted in 1935
preparation for a fully sovereign state was interrupted by the japanese occupation of the philippines during world war ii the united states suffered a total of 62,514 casualties including 13,973 deaths in its attempt to liberate the philippines from imperial japanese rule during the hard-fought philippines campaign from 1944–1945 full independence came with the recognition of philippine sovereignty by the us in 1946

 dominican republic 
the annexation of santo domingo was an attempted treaty during the later reconstruction era initiated by united states president ulysses s grant in 1869 to annex santo domingo as the dominican republic was then commonly known as a united states territory with the promise of eventual statehood president grant feared some european power would take the island in violation of the monroe doctrine he privately thought annexation would be a safety valve for african americans who were suffering persecution in the us but he did not include this in his official messages grant speculated that the acquisition of santo domingo would help bring about the end of slavery in cuba and elsewhere militarily he wanted a us naval port in the dominican republic which would also serve as protection for a projected canal across nicaragua
on january 10 1870 president grant formally submitted sec fishs dominican republic annexation treaty to the us senate the treaty was stalled in the senate until sen sumners foreign relations committee started hearings in mid february 1870 on 19 february a referendum was held in the dominican republic in which nearly 99% of the votes cast were in favor of the annexation sec fish noted that the senate was reluctant to pass any measures initiated by the executive branch sen sumner allowed the treaty to be debated openly on the committee without giving his own opinion however on march 15 senator sumners foreign relations committee in a closed session voted to oppose the treaty 5 to 2 on march 24 in another closed session sen sumner came out strongly against the treaty sen sumner opposed the treaty believing annexation would be expensive launch an american empire in the caribbean and would diminish independent afro-hispanic and african creole republics in the western hemisphere grant met with many senators on capitol hill hoping to rally support for the treaty however to no avail grant refused the suggestion that the treaty drop the dominican statehood clause finally on june 30 1870 the senate defeated the dominican republic annexation treaty by a vote of 28 to 28 eighteen senators had joined sen sumner to defeat the dominican annexation treaty
the first united states occupation of the dominican republic lasted from 1916 to 1924 it was one of the many interventions in latin america undertaken by the military forces of the united states on may 13 1916 rear admiral william b caperton forced the dominican republics secretary of war desiderio arias who had seized power from juan isidro jimenes pereyra to leave santo domingo by threatening the city with naval bombardment
from the start of the intervention until the us marines withdrew in 1924 they were in almost continuous actions on both the squad and platoon levels fighting numerous small-unit actions with elusive guerilla forces despite the ability of the marines to bring a large amount of firepower to bear against the guerillas from both the ground and the air the occupation troops had their share of problems as well sometimes the enemy would successfully ambush a lone marine patrol killing all or most of its members and would scatter before reinforcements arrived on the scene

in 1917 the united states purchased the former danish colony of st croix st john and st thomas which is now the us virgin islands the united states—which had made an earlier approach in 1902—purchased these islands because they feared that the islands might be seized as a submarine base during world war i after several months of secret negotiations a sales price of 25 million was agreed a non-binding referendum in denmark held in late 1916 confirmed the decision to sell by a wide margin the us took possession of the islands on march 31 1917 a few days before the us entered the war the deal was ratified and finalized on january 17 1917 when the united states and denmark exchanged their respective treaty ratifications the territory was renamed the us virgin islands us citizenship was granted to the inhabitants of the islands in 1927

the banco convention of 1905 resulted in many exchanges of bancos land surrounded by bends in the river that became segregated from either country by a cutoff often due to rapid accretion or avulsion of the alluvial channel between the two nations most often in the lower rio grande valley under the treaty the following transfers involving texas occurred from 1910–1976in 1927 under the same 1905 convention the us acquired two bancos from mexico at the colorado river border with arizona farmers banco covering 583.4 acres 2.361 km2 a part of the cocopah indian reservation at 32°37′27″n 114°46′45″w was ceded to the us with controversy fain banco 259 acres 1.05 km2 at 32°31′32″n 114°47′28″w also became us soil
proposed based on aerial surveys in 2008 there are 138 cases where the widest channel of normal flow of the rio grande has shifted from previous surveys therefore the international boundary line is to be changed under article iii of the 1970 boundary treaty the result is 138 proposed transfers of territory that remain pending further evaluation and approval by the international boundary and water commission and the two governments upon resolution the us is to cede 7 islands and 60 cuts in the rio grande to mexico totaling 1,251.2 acres 5.063 km2 while mexico is to cede 3 islands and 68 cuts to the us totaling 1,275.9 acres 5.163 km2
