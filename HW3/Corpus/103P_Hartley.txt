comet hartley 2 designated as 103phartley by the minor planet center is a small periodic comet with an orbital period of 6.46 years it was discovered by malcolm hartley in 1986 at the schmidt telescope unit siding spring observatory australia its diameter is estimated to be 1.2 to 1.6 kilometres 0.75 to 0.99 mihartley 2 was the target of a flyby of the deep impact spacecraft as part of the epoxi mission on 4 november 2010 which was able to approach within 700 kilometers 430 mi of hartley 2 as part of its extended mission as of  november 2010 hartley 2 is the smallest comet which has been visited it is the fifth comet visited by spacecraft and the second comet visited by the deep impact spacecraft which first visited comet tempel 1 on 4 july 2005


 discovery and orbit 
comet hartley 2 is a small jupiter-family comet having an orbital period of 6.46 years it was discovered by malcolm hartley in 1986 at the schmidt telescope unit siding spring observatory australia it has the perihelion near the earths orbit at 1.05 au from the sun


 2010 earth approach 

the comet passed within 0.12 au 18,000,000 km 11,000,000 mi of earth on 20 october 2010 only eight days before coming to perihelion closest approach to the sun on 28 october 2010 from northern latitudes during early november 2010 the comet was visible around midnight without interference from the moondespite its current close passage by earths orbit the comet is not yet a known source of meteor showers however that could change dust trails from the recent returns of 103phartley 2 move in and out of earths orbit and the 1979-dust trail is expected to hit in 2062 and 2068after the 2010 perihelion passage not accounting for nongravitational forces hartley 2 is estimated to come back to perihelion around 20 april 2017


 characteristics 

observation by the spitzer space telescope in august 2008 showed the comet nucleus to have a radius of 0.57 ± 0.08 kilometers 0.354 ± 0.050 mi and a low albedo of 0.028 the mass of the comet is estimated to be about 300 megatonnes 3.0×1011 kg barring a catastrophic breakup or major splitting event the comet should be able to survive up to another 100 apparitions 700 years at its current rate of mass lossradar observations by the arecibo observatory during the comets 2010 apparition revealed that the nucleus is highly elongated and rotates over an 18-hour period the project manager of the epoxi mission described its shape as a cross between a bowling pin and a picklein 2011 herschel space observatory detected the signature of vaporized water in the comets coma hartley 2 contains half as much heavy water as other comets analyzed before with the same ratio between heavy water and regular water as found in earths oceansfor many years it was known that few comets produced more water vapor than it should by the redirection of nucleus of water ice the flyby of hartley 2 showed that many of the icy grains in the coma are driven out by the outgassing of carbon dioxide it is believed that this is the source of much of the water coming from the comet
observations of hartley 2 showed the importance of carbon-monoxide ice to carbon-dioxide ice in comets after a reexamination it was found that the abundances of carbon-monoxide ice and carbon dioxide ice show that short-period comets formed under warmer conditions than the longer period comets this shows that the short-period comets formed closer to the sun than the long-term comets this discovery goes well with the measurements of heavy water in hartley 2


 deep impact flyby epoxi mission 

the epoxi mission flyby showed that the material being ejected from the comet is primarily composed of co2 gas michael ahearn the science team leader for the epoxi mission stated early observations of the comet show that for the first time we may be able to connect activity to individual features on the nucleusa university of maryland-led study published in the 17 june issue of the journal science described an analysis of the mission
key findings from the mission include  1 the smooth relatively inactive waist of the peanut shaped comet has probably been re-deposited 2 hartley 2  spins around one axis but also tumbles around a different axis and 3 on its larger rougher ends the comets surface contains glittering blocky objects that are about 165 feet 50 meters high and 260 feet 80 meters wide as big as a 16-story building  moreover these objects appear to be two to three times more reflective than the surface average
hartley 2 is a hyperactive little comet spewing out more water than other comets its size said university of maryland astronomer michael ahearn who is lead author on the science paper and principal investigator for the epoxi and deep impact missions when warmed by the sun dry ice frozen carbon dioxide deep in the comets body turns to gas jetting off the comet and dragging water ice with it
it is now believed that some of the dust icy chunks and other material coming off the ends of the comet are moving slowly enough to be captured by even the weak gravity of the comet this material then falls back into the lowest point—the middle


 deep impact flyby 

the deep impact spacecraft which had previously photographed comet tempel 1 is now being reused by nasa to study hartley 2 the initial plan was for a flyby of comet boethin however boethin had not been observed since 1986 and its orbit could not be calculated with sufficient precision to permit a flyby so nasa re-targeted the spacecraft toward hartley 2 instead the spacecraft came within 435 miles 700 km while moving at 27,500 miles per hour 44,300 kmh on 4 november 2010 the data from the flyby were transmitted back to earth through nasas deep space networkthe flyby was able to show that the comet is 2.25 kilometers 1.40 mi long and peanut shaped some jets of material are being ejected from the dark side of the comet rather than the sunlit side scientists involved in the epoxi mission describe the comet as being unusually active with mission scientist don yeomans stating that its hyperactive small and feistynasas scientists reported that the rays coming off the rough ends consist of hundreds of tons of fluffy ice and dust chunks – the largest particles are of golf ball to basketball-size – and they are ejected by jets of carbon dioxide the scientists also said that this is the first time that comet activity powered by sublimation of frozen carbon dioxide is observed as the comet nears the sun the co2 ice within the comet must be primordial dating from the beginnings of the solar system
