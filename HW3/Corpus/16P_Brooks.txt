16pbrooks also known as brooks 2 is a periodic comet discovered by william robert brooks on july 7 1889 but failed to note any motion he was able to confirm the discovery the next morning having seen that the comet had moved north on august 1 1889 the famous comet hunter edward emerson barnard discovered two fragments of the comet labeled b and c located 1 and 4.5 arc minutes away on august 2 he found another four or five but these were no longer visible the next day on august 4 he observed two more objects labeled d and e e disappeared by the next night and d was gone by the next week around mid-month b grew large and faint finally disappearing at the beginning of september c managed to survive until mid-november 1889 no new nuclei were discovered before the apparition ended on january 13 1891
the breakup is believed to have been caused by the passage of the comet within jupiters roche limit in 1886 when it spent two days within the orbit of io after the discovery apparition the comet has always been over two magnitudes fainter and no fragments have been seen since 1889
on 31 december 2016 the comet will pass 0.333 au from jupiter then on 3 july 2053 pass 0.247 au 37,000,000 km 23,000,000 mi from jupiter


 discovery 
william r brooks geneva new york was sweeping for comets on the morning of 1889 july 7 when he found this comet in the southeastern sky within the constellation aquarius he described it as faint with a coma 1 arc minute across and a tail 10 arc minutes long although he was unable to detect any motion before sunrise brooks quickly found the comet the next morning and noted it had moved slightly northward


 historical highlights 
the comet steadily brightened after discovery as it approached both the sun and earth but with the brightening came surprises on august 1 e e barnard spotted two small nebulous companions located 1 and 4.5 arc minutes away the next night barnard saw four or five additional nebulous objects all of which were absent on august 3 on august 4 barnard saw two more objects the main nucleus was labelled a while those seen on august 1 were labelled b and c the two objects seen on august 4 were labelled d and e companion e was not seen after the 4th while d remained visible for about a week by mid-august b suddenly began to grow large and diffuse and it was last seen on september 5 companion c remained observable until november 26 while the main nucleus a remained visible nearly until the time the comet was last seen which was 1891 january 13
another interesting aspect of this comets first apparition was that it attained a maximum magnitude of 8 despite a smaller perihelion distance in the 20th century the comet has never become brighter than magnitude 10.5 this abnormal brightening and the fact that the comet split into multiple pieces is blamed on the planet jupiter it would seem the comet passed only 0.001 au from jupiter in 1886 actually spending two days within the orbit of jupiters moon io the gravitational stresses apparently shattered the comet revealing fresh surfaces to interact with the suns radiation at the 1889 apparition in addition to the comet never having attained this brightness since 1889 no trace of any of the other nuclei have ever been present at later returns
since the comets discovery apparition there has been little to get excited about it has been missed only twice in 1918 and 1967 when the sun-earth-comet geometry was especially bad and an encounter with jupiter in 1921 decreased the perihelion distance from 1.96 au to 1.86 au
