international space station spacewalks are major events in the building and maintaining of the orbital laboratory spacewalks are performed to install new components to the international space station iss to re-wire systems modules and equipment and to monitor install and retrieve scientific experimentsdue to the complexity of building a station in space space agencies train astronauts extensively preparing them to encounter surprises during spacewalks teaching them how to assemble special tools and equipment and carefully coordinating every activity during spacewalks from 1998 to 2005 thirty-seven space shuttle missions were scheduled to assemble outfit and begin experiments and research aboard the stationthe initial spacewalk to begin the assembly of the international space station was held on december 7 1998 following the launch of the first section of the station zarya from baikonur cosmodrome kazakhstan on november 20 1998 the spacewalk attached the us-built unity node to zarya the longest spacewalk was performed on march 11 2001 when sts-102 crew members susan j helms and james s voss conducted a full spacewalk and then returned to the airlock but remained in their suits ready to exit the airlock again in case the robotics operations ran into problems the total time for that spacewalk was eight hours and fifty-six minutesas of august 16 2018 there have been 212 spacewalks devoted to assembly and maintenance of the international space station totaling 1327 hours and 17 minutes as of may 12 2017 there have been 200 spacewalks totaling 1247 hours and 55 minutes as of march 2 2011 a total time of 973 hours and fifty-three minutes has been spent in extra-vehicular activity eva with 127 of these evas performed from station airlocks totaling 787 hours and twenty-eight minutes in spacewalk time from the station itself twenty-eight spacewalks have been performed from a shuttle ninety-three from the quest joint airlock thirty-two from the pirs docking compartment and two from the transfer compartment at the forward end of the zvezda service moduledenotes spacewalks performed from the pirs docking compartment in russian orlan suits
