354plinear formerly p2010 a2 linear is a small solar system body that displayed characteristics of both an asteroid and a comet and thus was initially given a cometary designation because it has the orbit of a main-belt asteroid and showed the tail of a comet it was listed as a main-belt comet but within a month of discovery an analysis of images by the hubble telescope suggested that its tail was generated by dust and gravel resulting from a recent head-on collision between asteroids rather than from sublimation of cometary ice this was the first time a small-body collision had been observed since then minor planet 596 scheila has also been seen to undergo a collision in late 2010 the position of the nucleus was remarkable for being offset from the axis of the tail and outside the dust halo a situation never before seen in a comet the tail is created by millimeter-sized particles being pushed back by solar radiation pressure


 overview 
p2010 a2 was discovered on january 6 2010 by lincoln near-earth asteroid research linear using a 1-meter 36 reflecting telescope with a ccd camera  it was linears 193rd comet discovery  it has been observed over a 112-day arc of the 3.5 year orbit  it appears to have come to perihelion closest approach to the sun around the start of december 2009 about a month before it was discovered
with an aphelion furthest distance from the sun of only 2.6 au p2010 a2 spends all of its time inside of the frostline at 2.7 au beyond the frostline volatile ices are generally more common  early observations did not detect water vapor or other gases within less than a month of its discovery it was doubtful that the tail of p2010 a2 was generated via active outgassing from sublimation of ices hidden beneath the crust  early modeling indicated that the asteroid became active in late march 2009 reached maximum activity in early june 2009 and eased activity in early december 2009observations with the hubble space telescope and the narrow angle camera on board the rosetta spacecraft indicate that the dust trail seen was probably created by the impact of a small meter size object on the larger asteroid in february or march 2009 although it cannot be ruled out that the asteroids rotation increased from solar radiation resulting in a loss of mass that formed a comet-like tailp2010 a2 is likely about 150 meters 460 feet in diameter even when it was discovered it was suspected of being less than 500 meters in diameteranother object centaur 60558 echeclus in 2006 was suspected of outgassing as a result of an undetermined splitting eventthe orbit of p2010 a2 is consistent with membership in the flora asteroid family produced by collisional shattering more than 100 million years ago  the flora family of asteroids may be the source of the chicxulub cretaceousâ€“paleogene impactor the likely culprit in the extinction of the dinosaurs
