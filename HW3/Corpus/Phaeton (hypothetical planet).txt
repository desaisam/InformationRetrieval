phaeton or phaëton was the hypothetical planet theorized by the titius–bode law to have existed between the orbits of mars and jupiter the destruction of which supposedly led to the formation of the asteroid belt including the dwarf planet ceres  the hypothetical planet was named for phaethon the son of the sun god helios in greek mythology who attempted to drive his fathers solar chariot for a day with disastrous results and was ultimately destroyed by zeus


 phaeton hypothesis 

according to the discredited titius–bode law a planet was believed to exist between mars and jupiter  after observing the discoveries made by the german astronomer and professor johann daniel titius 1729–1796 johann elert bode himself urged a search for the fifth planet  when ceres the largest of the asteroids in the asteroid belt now considered a dwarf planet was serendipitously discovered in 1801 by the italian giuseppe piazzi and found to match the predicted position of the fifth planet many believed it was the missing planet  however in 1802 astronomer heinrich wilhelm matthäus olbers discovered and named another object in the same general orbit as ceres the asteroid pallas
olbers proposed that these new discoveries were the fragments of a disrupted planet that had formerly orbited the sun he also predicted that more of these pieces would be found the discovery of the asteroid juno by karl ludwig harding and vesta by olbers buttressed the olbers hypothesis
in 1823 german linguist and retired teacher johann gottlieb radlof called olbers destroyed planet phaëthon linking it to the greek myths and legends about phaethon and others his ideas were similar to those later advocated by immanuel velikovsky despite radlofs precedence russian authors of the 20th century claimed that the hypothetical planet of olbers was left nameless for a century and a half only in 1949 did the well-known soviet astronomer sergej vladirimovich orlov give it the name phaeton this name has become establishedtheories regarding the formation of the asteroid belt from the destruction of a hypothetical fifth planet are today collectively referred to as the disruption theory this theory states that there was once a major planetary member of our solar system circulating in the present gap between mars and jupiter which was variously destroyed when

it veered too close to jupiter and was torn apart by its powerful gravity
it was struck by another large celestial body
it was destroyed by a hypothetical brown dwarf the companion star to the sun known as nemesis
it was shattered by some internal catastrophetoday the phaeton hypothesis has been superseded by the accretion model  most astronomers today believe that the asteroids in the main belt are remnants of the protoplanetary disk and in this region the incorporation of protoplanetary remnants into the planets was prevented by large gravitational perturbations induced by jupiter during the formative period of the solar system


 other hypotheses 
some scientists and non-scientists continue to advocate for the existence and destruction of a phaeton-like planet
zecharia sitchin suggested that the goddess known to the sumerians as tiamat in fact relates to a planet that was destroyed by a rogue planet known as nibiru creating both earth and the asteroid belt his work is widely regarded as pseudosciencethe astronomer and author tom van flandern held that phaeton exploded through some internal mechanism in his exploded planet hypothesis 2000 he lists possible reasons for its explosion a runaway nuclear reaction of uranium in its core a change of state as the planet cooled down creating a density phase change or through continual absorption of heat in the core from gravitonsin 1972 soyuzmultfilm studies produced an animated short film titled фаэтон - сын солнца phaeton the son of sun directed by vasiliy livanov василий ливанов in which the subject of the asteroid belt is treated as the remains of a planet


 phaeton in literature 

several works of fiction feature a supposed planet sometimes named phaeton existing in the past between the orbits of mars and jupiter which somehow became the solar systems asteroid belt
