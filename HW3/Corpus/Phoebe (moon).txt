phoebe  fee-bee ancient greek φοίβη phoíbē is an irregular satellite of saturn with a mean diameter of 213 km it was discovered by william henry pickering on march 18 1899 from photographic plates that had been taken starting on 16 august 1898 at the boyden station of the carmen alto observatory near arequipa peru by delisle stewart it was the first satellite to be discovered photographically
phoebe was the first target encountered upon the arrival of the cassini spacecraft in the saturn system in 2004 and is thus unusually well-studied for an irregular satellite of its size cassinis trajectory to saturn and time of arrival were specifically chosen to permit this flyby after the encounter and its insertion into orbit cassini did not go much beyond the orbit of iapetus
phoebe is roughly spherical and has a differentiated interior it was spherical and hot early in its history and was battered out of roundness by repeated impacts it is believed to be a captured centaur that originated in the kuiper belt


 history 


 discovery 
phoebe was discovered by william henry pickering on 17 march 1899  from photographic plates that had been taken starting on 16 august 1898 at the boyden observatory near arequipa peru by delisle stewart it was the first satellite to be discovered photographically


 naming 
phoebe was named after phoebe a titaness in greek mythology that was associated with the moon it is also designated saturn ix in some scientific literature the iau nomenclature standards have stated that features on phoebe are to be named after characters in the greek myth of jason and the argonauts in 2005 the iau officially named 24 craters acastus admetus amphion butes calais canthus clytius erginus euphemus eurydamas eurytion eurytus hylas idmon iphitus jason mopsus nauplius oileus peleus phlias talaus telamon and zetes
toby owen of the university of hawaii at manoa chairman of the international astronomical union outer solar system task group said

we picked the legend of the argonauts for phoebe as it has some resonance with the exploration of the saturn system by cassini–huygens we cant say that our participating scientists include heroes like hercules and atalanta but they do represent a wide international spectrum of outstanding people who were willing to take the risk of joining this voyage to a distant realm in hopes of bringing back a grand prize


 orbit 

phoebes orbit is retrograde that is it orbits saturn opposite to saturns rotation for more than 100 years phoebe was saturns outermost known moon until the discovery of several smaller moons in 2000 phoebe is almost 4 times more distant from saturn than its nearest major neighbor iapetus and is substantially larger than any of the other moons orbiting planets at comparable distances
all of saturns regular moons except iapetus orbit very nearly in the plane of saturns equator the outer irregular satellites follow moderately to highly eccentric orbits and none are expected to rotate synchronously as all the inner moons of saturn do except for hyperion see saturns satellites families


 phoebe ring 

the phoebe ring is one of the rings of saturn this ring is tilted 27 degrees from saturns equatorial plane and the other rings it extends from at least 128 to 207 times the radius of saturn phoebe orbits the planet at an average distance of 215 saturn radii the ring is about 20 times as thick as the diameter of the planet because the rings particles are presumed to have originated from micrometeoroid impacts on phoebe they should share its retrograde orbit which is opposite to the orbital motion of the next inner moon iapetus inwardly migrating ring material would thus strike iapetuss leading hemisphere creating its two-tone coloration although very large the ring is virtually invisible—it was discovered using nasas infrared spitzer space telescope


 physical characteristics 

phoebe is roughly spherical and has a diameter of 213±1.4 km 132 mi approximately one-sixteenth of that of the moon phoebe rotates every nine hours 16 minutes and it completes a full orbit around saturn in about 18 months its surface temperature is 75 k −198.2 °c
most of saturns inner moons have very bright surfaces but phoebes albedo is very low 0.06 as dark as lampblack the phoebean surface is extremely heavily scarred with craters up to 80 kilometres across one of which has walls 16 kilometres high
phoebes dark coloring initially led to scientists surmising that it was a captured asteroid as it resembled the common class of dark carbonaceous asteroids these are chemically very primitive and are thought to be composed of original solids that condensed out of the solar nebula with little modification since then
however images from cassini indicate that phoebes craters show a considerable variation in brightness which indicate the presence of large quantities of ice below a relatively thin blanket of dark surface deposits some 300 to 500 metres 980 to 1,640 ft thick in addition quantities of carbon dioxide have been detected on the surface a finding that has never been replicated for an asteroid it is estimated that phoebe is about 50% rock as opposed to the 35% or so that typifies saturns inner moons for these reasons scientists are coming to think that phoebe is in fact a captured centaur one of a number of icy planetoids from the kuiper belt that orbit the sun between jupiter and neptune phoebe is the first such object to be imaged as anything other than a dot
despite its small size phoebe is thought to have been a spherical body early in its history with a differentiated interior before solidifying and being battered into its current slightly non-equilibrium shapematerial displaced from phoebes surface by microscopic meteor impacts may be responsible for the dark areas on the surface of hyperion debris from the biggest impacts may be the origin of the other moons of phoebes group the norse group—all of which are less than 10 km in diameter

 formation 
phoebe formed in the kuiper belt within three million years after the origin of the solar system this was early enough that sufficient radioactive material was available to collapse it into a sphere and stay warm enough to have liquid water for tens of millions of years


 observation and exploration 

unlike saturns other moons phoebe was not favorably placed for the voyager probes voyager 2 observed phoebe for a few hours in september 1981 in the images taken from a distance of 2.2 million kilometres at low phase angle the size of phoebe was approximately 11 pixels and showed bright spots on the otherwise dark surface
cassini passed 2,068 kilometres 1,285 mi from phoebe on 11 june 2004 returning many high-resolution images which revealed a scarred surface because voyager 2 had not been able to produce any high quality images of phoebe obtaining them was a priority for the cassini mission and its flight path was deliberately designed to take it close by otherwise cassini would likely not have returned images much better than voyagers because of phoebes short rotation period of approximately 9 hours 17 minutes cassini was able to map virtually the entire surface of phoebe the close fly-by enabled the mass of phoebe to be determined with an uncertainty of only 1 in 500


 in literature 
in the expanse novel series phoebes possible capture by saturn places it as the spark setting off the main storyline in the story aliens sent phoebe towards primordial earth to take it over but it was intercepted by saturn
