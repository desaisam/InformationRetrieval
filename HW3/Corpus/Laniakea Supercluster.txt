the laniakea supercluster laniakea hawaiian for open skies or immense heaven also called local supercluster or local scl or sometimes lenakaeia is the galaxy supercluster that is home to the milky way and approximately 100,000 other nearby galaxies it was defined in september 2014 when a group of astronomers including r brent tully of the university of hawaii hélène courtois of the university of lyon yehuda hoffman of the hebrew university of jerusalem and daniel pomarède of cea université paris-saclay published a new way of defining superclusters according to the relative velocities of galaxies the new definition of the local supercluster subsumes the prior defined local supercluster the virgo supercluster as an appendagefollow-up studies suggest that laniakea is not gravitationally bound it will disperse rather than continue to maintain itself as an overdensity relative to surrounding areas


 characteristics 
the laniakea supercluster encompasses approximately 100,000 galaxies stretched out over 160 megaparsecs 520 million light-years it has the approximate mass of 1017 solar masses or a hundred thousand times that of our galaxy which is almost the same as that of the horologium supercluster it consists of four subparts which were known previously as separate superclusters

virgo supercluster the part in which the milky way resides
hydra-centaurus supercluster
the great attractor laniakeas central gravitational point near norma
antlia wall known as hydra supercluster
centaurus supercluster
pavo-indus supercluster
southern supercluster including fornax cluster s373 dorado and eridanus cloudsthe most massive galaxy clusters of laniakea are virgo hydra centaurus abell 3565 abell 3574 abell 3521 fornax eridanus and norma the entire supercluster consists of approximately 300 to 500 known galaxy clusters and groups the real number may be much larger because some of these are traversing the zone of avoidance making them essentially undetectable
superclusters are some of the universes largest structures and have boundaries that are difficult to define especially from the inside the team used radio telescopes to map the motions of a large collection of local galaxies within a given supercluster most galaxy motions will be directed inward toward the center of mass in the case of laniakea this gravitational focal point is called the great attractor and influences the motions of the local group of galaxies where the milky way galaxy resides and all others throughout the supercluster unlike its constituent clusters laniakea is not gravitationally bound and is projected to be torn apart by dark energy


 discovery method 
the new method used to analyze galaxy movements to distinguish peculiar motion from cosmic expansion is wiener filtering which works for well-defined positional information allowing analysis out to about 300×106 ly 92 mpc showing flow patterns with that limitation laniakea is shown to be heading in the direction of the shapley superclustersouth african astronomer tony fairall stated in 1988 that redshifts suggested that the virgo and hydra-centaurus superclusters may be connected


 location 
the neighboring superclusters to laniakea are the shapley supercluster hercules supercluster coma supercluster and perseus-pisces supercluster they are all part of the composition of the pisces-cetus supercluster complex the edges of the superclusters and laniakea were not clearly known at the time of laniakeas definition


 name 
the name laniakea means immense heaven in hawaiian from  lani meaning heaven and  ākea meaning spacious immeasurable the name was suggested by nawaa napoleon an associate professor of hawaiian language at kapiolani community college the name honors polynesian navigators who used knowledge of the heavens to navigate the pacific ocean
