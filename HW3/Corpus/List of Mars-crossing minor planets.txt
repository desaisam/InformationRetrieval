a mars-crossing asteroid mca also mars-crosser mc is an asteroid whose orbit crosses that of mars the known numbered mars-crossers are listed here they include the two numbered mars trojans 5261 eureka and 101429 1998 vf31
many databases for instance the jpl small-body database jpl sbdb only list asteroids with a perihelion greater than 1.3 au as mars-crossers an asteroid with a perihelion less than this is classed as a near-earth object even though it is crossing the orbit of mars as well as crossing or coming near to that of earth nevertheless these objects are listed on this page a grazer is an object with a perihelion below the aphelion of mars 1.67 au but above the martian perihelion 1.38 au the jpl sbdb lists 13,500 mars-crossing asteroids only 18 mcas are brighter than absolute magnitude h 12.5 which typically makes these asteroids with h12.5 more than 13 km in diameter depending on the albedo the smallest known mcas have an absolute magnitude h of around 24 and are typically less than 100 meters in diameter

these objects are not catalogued as mars-crossers in databases such as the jet propulsion laboratorys online small-body database browser  instead they are categorized as near earth objects neos
