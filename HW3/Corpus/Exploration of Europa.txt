europa  listen yoor-oh-pə jupiter ii is the smallest of the four galilean moons orbiting jupiter and the sixth-closest to the planet of all the 79 known moons of jupiter it is also the sixth-largest moon in the solar system europa was discovered in 1610 by galileo galilei and was named after europa the phoenician mother of king minos of crete and lover of zeus the greek equivalent of the roman god jupiter
slightly smaller than earths moon europa is primarily made of silicate rock and has a water-ice crust and probably an iron–nickel core it has a very thin atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen its surface is striated by cracks and streaks but craters are relatively few in addition to earth-bound telescope observations europa has been examined by a succession of space probe flybys the first occurring in the early 1970s
europa has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in the solar system the apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it which could conceivably harbour extraterrestrial life the predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on europa suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the sea floor this may be important in determining whether europa could be habitable in addition the hubble space telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on saturns moon enceladus which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers in may 2018 astronomers provided supporting evidence of water plume activity on europa based on an updated critical analysis of data obtained from the galileo space probe which orbited jupiter from 1995 to 2003 such plume activity could help researchers in a search for life from the subsurface europan ocean without having to land on the moonthe galileo mission launched in 1989 provides the bulk of current data on europa no spacecraft has yet landed on europa although there have been several proposed exploration missions the european space agencys jupiter icy moon explorer juice is a mission to ganymede that is due to launch in 2022 and will include two flybys of europa nasas planned europa clipper will be launched in the mid-2020s


 discovery and naming 
europa along with jupiters three other large moons io ganymede and callisto was discovered by galileo galilei on 8 january 1610 and possibly independently by simon marius the first reported observation of io and europa was made by galileo on 7 january 1610 using a 20×-magnification refracting telescope at the university of padua however in that observation galileo could not separate io and europa due to the low magnification of his telescope so that the two were recorded as a single point of light the following day 8 january 1610 used as the discovery date for europa by the iau io and europa were seen for the first time as separate bodies during galileos observations of the jupiter systemeuropa is named after europa daughter of the king of tyre a phoenician noblewoman in greek mythology like all the galilean satellites europa is named after a lover of zeus the greek counterpart of jupiter europa was courted by zeus and became the queen of crete the naming scheme was suggested by simon marius who attributed the proposal to johannes keplerthe names fell out of favor for a considerable time and were not revived in general use until the mid-20th century in much of the earlier astronomical literature europa is simply referred to by its roman numeral designation as jupiter ii a system also introduced by galileo or as the second satellite of jupiter in 1892 the discovery of amalthea whose orbit lay closer to jupiter than those of the galilean moons pushed europa to the third position the voyager probes discovered three more inner satellites in 1979 so europa is now considered jupiters sixth satellite though it is still sometimes referred to as jupiter ii


 orbit and rotation 

europa orbits jupiter in just over three and a half days with an orbital radius of about 670,900 km with an orbital eccentricity of only 0.009 the orbit itself is nearly circular and the orbital inclination relative to jupiters equatorial plane is small at 0.470° like its fellow galilean satellites europa is tidally locked to jupiter with one hemisphere of europa constantly facing jupiter because of this there is a sub-jovian point on europas surface from which jupiter would appear to hang directly overhead europas prime meridian is a line passing through this point research suggests that the tidal locking may not be full as a non-synchronous rotation has been proposed europa spins faster than it orbits or at least did so in the past this suggests an asymmetry in internal mass distribution and that a layer of subsurface liquid separates the icy crust from the rocky interiorthe slight eccentricity of europas orbit maintained by the gravitational disturbances from the other galileans causes europas sub-jovian point to oscillate around a mean position as europa comes slightly nearer to jupiter jupiters gravitational attraction increases causing europa to elongate towards and away from it as europa moves slightly away from jupiter jupiters gravitational force decreases causing europa to relax back into a more spherical shape and creating tides in its ocean the orbital eccentricity of europa is continuously pumped by its mean-motion resonance with io thus the tidal flexing kneads europas interior and gives it a source of heat possibly allowing its ocean to stay liquid while driving subsurface geological processes the ultimate source of this energy is jupiters rotation which is tapped by io through the tides it raises on jupiter and is transferred to europa and ganymede by the orbital resonanceanalysis of the unique cracks lining europa yielded evidence that it likely spun around a tilted axis at some point in time if correct this would explain many of europas features europas immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean europas tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean and even how long the ocean has been liquid its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes when there is too much stress it cracks a tilt in europas axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought the reason for this is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day completing one precession period over several months a tilt could also affect the estimates of the age of europas ocean tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps europas ocean liquid and a tilt in the spin axis would cause more heat to be generated by tidal forces such additional heat would have allowed the ocean to remain liquid for a longer time however it has not yet been determined when this hypothesized shift in the spin axis might have occurred


 physical characteristics 

europa is slightly smaller than the moon at just over 3,100 kilometres 1,900 mi in diameter it is the sixth-largest moon and fifteenth-largest object in the solar system though by a wide margin the least massive of the galilean satellites it is nonetheless more massive than all known moons in the solar system smaller than itself combined its bulk density suggests that it is similar in composition to the terrestrial planets being primarily composed of silicate rock


 internal structure 
it is estimated that europa has an outer layer of water around 100 km 62 mi thick a part frozen as its crust and a part as a liquid ocean underneath the ice recent magnetic-field data from the galileo orbiter showed that europa has an induced magnetic field through interaction with jupiters which suggests the presence of a subsurface conductive layer this layer is likely a salty liquid-water ocean portions of the crust are estimated to have undergone a rotation of nearly 80° nearly flipping over see true polar wander which would be unlikely if the ice were solidly attached to the mantle europa probably contains a metallic iron core


 surface features 

europa is the smoothest known object in the solar system lacking large-scale features such as mountains and craters however according to one study europas equator may be covered in icy spikes called penitentes which may be up to fifteen meters high due to direct overhead sunlight on the equator causing the ice to sublime forming vertical cracks although the imaging available from the galileo orbiter does not have the resolution needed to confirm this radar and thermal data are consistent with this interpretation the prominent markings crisscrossing europa appear to be mainly albedo features that emphasize low topography there are few craters on europa because its surface is tectonically too active and therefore young europas icy crust has an albedo light reflectivity of 0.64 one of the highest of all moons this indicates a young and active surface based on estimates of the frequency of cometary bombardment that europa experiences the surface is about 20 to 180 million years old there is currently no full scientific consensus among the sometimes contradictory explanations for the surface features of europathe radiation level at the surface of europa is equivalent to a dose of about 5400 msv 540 rem per day an amount of radiation that would cause severe illness or death in human beings exposed for a single day


 lineae 

europas most striking surface features are a series of dark streaks crisscrossing the entire globe called lineae english lines close examination shows that the edges of europas crust on either side of the cracks have moved relative to each other the larger bands are more than 20 km 12 mi across often with dark diffuse outer edges regular striations and a central band of lighter material
the most likely hypothesis is that the lineae on europa were produced by a series of eruptions of warm ice as the europan crust spread open to expose warmer layers beneath the effect would have been similar to that seen in earths oceanic ridges these various fractures are thought to have been caused in large part by the tidal flexing exerted by jupiter because europa is tidally locked to jupiter and therefore always maintains approximately the same orientation towards jupiter the stress patterns should form a distinctive and predictable pattern however only the youngest of europas fractures conform to the predicted pattern other fractures appear to occur at increasingly different orientations the older they are this could be explained if europas surface rotates slightly faster than its interior an effect that is possible due to the subsurface ocean mechanically decoupling europas surface from its rocky mantle and the effects of jupiters gravity tugging on europas outer ice crust comparisons of voyager and galileo spacecraft photos serve to put an upper limit on this hypothetical slippage a full revolution of the outer rigid shell relative to the interior of europa takes at least 12,000 years studies of voyager and galileo images have revealed evidence of subduction on europas surface suggesting that just as the cracks are analogous to ocean ridges so plates of icy crust analogous to tectonic plates on earth are recycled into the molten interior together the evidence for crustal spreading at bands and convergence at other sites marks the first evidence for plate tectonics on any world other than earth


 other geological features 
 
other features present on europa are circular and elliptical lenticulae latin for freckles many are domes some are pits and some are smooth dark spots others have a jumbled or rough texture the dome tops look like pieces of the older plains around them suggesting that the domes formed when the plains were pushed up from belowone hypothesis states that these lenticulae were formed by diapirs of warm ice rising up through the colder ice of the outer crust much like magma chambers in earths crust the smooth dark spots could be formed by meltwater released when the warm ice breaks through the surface the rough jumbled lenticulae called regions of chaos for example conamara chaos would then be formed from many small fragments of crust embedded in hummocky dark material appearing like icebergs in a frozen seaan alternative hypothesis suggest that lenticulae are actually small areas of chaos and that the claimed pits spots and domes are artefacts resulting from over-interpretation of early low-resolution galileo images the implication is that the ice is too thin to support the convective diapir model of feature formationin november 2011 a team of researchers from the university of texas at austin and elsewhere presented evidence in the journal nature suggesting that many chaos terrain features on europa sit atop vast lakes of liquid water these lakes would be entirely encased in europas icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist farther down beneath the ice shell full confirmation of the lakes existence will require a space mission designed to probe the ice shell either physically or indirectly for example using radar


 subsurface ocean 

scientists consensus is that a layer of liquid water exists beneath europas surface and that heat from tidal flexing allows the subsurface ocean to remain liquid europas surface temperature averages about 110 k −160 °c −260 °f at the equator and only 50 k −220 °c −370 °f at the poles keeping europas icy crust as hard as granite the first hints of a subsurface ocean came from theoretical considerations of tidal heating a consequence of europas slightly eccentric orbit and orbital resonance with the other galilean moons galileo imaging team members argue for the existence of a subsurface ocean from analysis of voyager and galileo images the most dramatic example is chaos terrain a common feature on europas surface that some interpret as a region where the subsurface ocean has melted through the icy crust this interpretation is controversial most geologists who have studied europa favor what is commonly called the thick ice model in which the ocean has rarely if ever directly interacted with the present surface the best evidence for the thick-ice model is a study of europas large craters the largest impact structures are surrounded by concentric rings and appear to be filled with relatively flat fresh ice based on this and on the calculated amount of heat generated by europan tides it is estimated that the outer crust of solid ice is approximately 10–30 km 6–19 mi thick including a ductile warm ice layer which could mean that the liquid ocean underneath may be about 100 km 60 mi deep this leads to a volume of europas oceans of 3 × 1018 m3 between two or three times the volume of earths oceansthe thin-ice model suggests that europas ice shell may be only a few kilometers thick however most planetary scientists conclude that this model considers only those topmost layers of europas crust that behave elastically when affected by jupiters tides one example is flexure analysis in which europas crust is modeled as a plane or sphere weighted and flexed by a heavy load models such as this suggest the outer elastic portion of the ice crust could be as thin as 200 metres 660 ft if the ice shell of europa is really only a few kilometers thick this thin ice model would mean that regular contact of the liquid interior with the surface could occur through open ridges causing the formation of areas of chaotic terrain


 composition 
the galileo orbiter found that europa has a weak magnetic moment which is induced by the varying part of the jovian magnetic field the field strength at the magnetic equator about 120 nt created by this magnetic moment is about one-sixth the strength of ganymedes field and six times the value of callistos the existence of the induced moment requires a layer of a highly electrically conductive material in europas interior the most plausible candidate for this role is a large subsurface ocean of liquid saltwatersince the voyager spacecraft flew past europa in 1979 scientists have worked to understand the composition of the reddish-brown material that coats fractures and other geologically youthful features on europas surface spectrographic evidence suggests that the dark reddish streaks and features on europas surface may be rich in salts such as magnesium sulfate deposited by evaporating water that emerged from within sulfuric acid hydrate is another possible explanation for the contaminant observed spectroscopically in either case because these materials are colorless or white when pure some other material must also be present to account for the reddish color and sulfur compounds are suspectedanother hypothesis for the colored regions is that they are composed of abiotic organic compounds collectively called tholins the morphology of europas impact craters and ridges is suggestive of fluidized material welling up from the fractures where pyrolysis and radiolysis take place in order to generate colored tholins on europa there must be a source of materials carbon nitrogen and water and a source of energy to make the reactions occur impurities in the water ice crust of europa are presumed both to emerge from the interior as cryovolcanic events that resurface the body and to accumulate from space as interplanetary dust tholins bring important astrobiological implications as they may play a role in prebiotic chemistry and abiogenesis


 sources of heat 
tidal heating occurs through the tidal friction and tidal flexing processes caused by tidal acceleration orbital and rotational energy are dissipated as heat in the core of the moon the internal ocean and the ice crust


 tidal friction 
ocean tides are converted to heat by frictional losses in the oceans and their interaction with the solid bottom and with the top ice crust in late 2008 it was suggested jupiter may keep europas oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity this generates so-called rossby waves that travel quite slowly at just a few kilometers per day but can generate significant kinetic energy for the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree the resonance from rossby waves would contain 7.3×1018 j of kinetic energy which is two thousand times larger than that of the flow excited by the dominant tidal forces dissipation of this energy could be the principal heat source of europas ocean


 tidal flexing 
tidal flexing kneads europas interior and ice shell which becomes a source of heat depending on the amount of tilt the heat generated by the ocean flow could be 100 to thousands of times greater than the heat generated by the flexing of europas rocky core in response to gravitational pull from jupiter and the other moons circling that planet europas seafloor could be heated by the moons constant flexing driving hydrothermal activity similar to undersea volcanoes in earths oceansexperiments and ice modeling published in 2016 indicate that tidal flexing dissipation can generate one order of magnitude more heat in europas ice than scientists had previously assumed their results indicates that most of the heat generated by the ice actually comes from the ices crystalline structure lattice as a result of deformation and not friction between the ice grains the greater the deformation of the ice sheet the more heat is generated


 radioactive decay 
in addition to tidal heating the interior of europa could also be heated by the decay of radioactive material radiogenic heating within the rocky mantle but the models and values observed are one hundred times higher than those that could be produced by radiogenic heating alone thus implying that tidal heating has a leading role in europa


 plumes 

the hubble space telescope acquired an image of europa in 2012 that was interpreted to be a plume of water vapour erupting from near its south pole the image suggests the plume may be 200 km 120 mi high or more than 20 times the height of mt everest it has been suggested that if they exist they are episodic and likely to appear when europa is at its farthest point from jupiter in agreement with tidal force modeling predictions additional imaging evidence from the hubble space telescope was presented in september 2016in may 2018 astronomers provided supporting evidence of water plume activity on europa based on an updated critical analysis of data obtained from the galileo space probe which orbited jupiter between 1995 to 2003 galileo flew by europa in 1997 within 206 km 128 mi of the moon’s surface and the researchers suggest it may have flown through a water plume such plume activity could help researchers in a search for life from the subsurface european ocean without having to land on the moonthe tidal forces are about 1,000 times stronger than the moons effect on earth the only other moon in the solar system exhibiting water vapor plumes is enceladus the estimated eruption rate at europa is about 7000 kgs compared to about 200 kgs for the plumes of enceladus if confirmed it would open the possibility of a flyby through the plume and obtain a sample to analyze in situ without having to use a lander and drill through miles of ice


 atmosphere 
observations with the goddard high resolution spectrograph of the hubble space telescope first described in 1995 revealed that europa has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of molecular oxygen o2 the surface pressure of europas atmosphere is 0.1 μpa or 10−12 times that of the earth in 1997 the galileo spacecraft confirmed the presence of a tenuous ionosphere an upper-atmospheric layer of charged particles around europa created by solar radiation and energetic particles from jupiters magnetosphere providing evidence of an atmosphere

unlike the oxygen in earths atmosphere europas is not of biological origin the surface-bounded atmosphere forms through radiolysis the dissociation of molecules through radiation solar ultraviolet radiation and charged particles ions and electrons from the jovian magnetospheric environment collide with europas icy surface splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen constituents these chemical components are then adsorbed and sputtered into the atmosphere the same radiation also creates collisional ejections of these products from the surface and the balance of these two processes forms an atmosphere molecular oxygen is the densest component of the atmosphere because it has a long lifetime after returning to the surface it does not stick freeze like a water or hydrogen peroxide molecule but rather desorbs from the surface and starts another ballistic arc molecular hydrogen never reaches the surface as it is light enough to escape europas surface gravityobservations of the surface have revealed that some of the molecular oxygen produced by radiolysis is not ejected from the surface because the surface may interact with the subsurface ocean considering the geological discussion above this molecular oxygen may make its way to the ocean where it could aid in biological processes one estimate suggests that given the turnover rate inferred from the apparent 0.5 gyr maximum age of europas surface ice subduction of radiolytically generated oxidizing species might well lead to oceanic free oxygen concentrations that are comparable to those in terrestrial deep oceansthe molecular hydrogen that escapes europas gravity along with atomic and molecular oxygen forms a gas torus in the vicinity of europas orbit around jupiter this neutral cloud has been detected by both the cassini and galileo spacecraft and has a greater content number of atoms and molecules than the neutral cloud surrounding jupiters inner moon io models predict that almost every atom or molecule in europas torus is eventually ionized thus providing a source to jupiters magnetospheric plasma


 exploration 

exploration of europa began with the jupiter flybys of pioneer 10 and 11 in 1973 and 1974 respectively the first closeup photos were of low resolution compared to later missions the two voyager probes traveled through the jovian system in 1979 providing more-detailed images of europas icy surface the images caused many scientists to speculate about the possibility of a liquid ocean underneath 
starting in 1995 the galileo space probe orbited jupiter for eight years until 2003 and provided the most detailed examination of the galilean moons to date it included the galileo europa mission and galileo millennium mission with numerous close flybys of europa in 2007 new horizons imaged europa as it flew by the jovian system while on its way to pluto


 future missions 
conjectures regarding extraterrestrial life have ensured a high-profile for europa and have led to steady lobbying for future missions the aims of these missions have ranged from examining europas chemical composition to searching for extraterrestrial life in its hypothesized subsurface oceans robotic missions to europa need to endure the high-radiation environment around itself and jupiter europa receives about 5.40 sv of radiation per dayin 2011 a europa mission was recommended by the us planetary science decadal survey in response nasa commissioned europa lander concept studies in 2011 along with concepts for a europa flyby europa clipper and a europa orbiter the orbiter element option concentrates on the ocean science while the multiple-flyby element clipper concentrates on the chemistry and energy science on 13 january 2014 the house appropriations committee announced a new bipartisan bill that includes 80 million funding to continue the europa mission concept studies
in 2012 jupiter icy moon explorer juice was selected by the european space agency esa as a planned mission that mission includes 2 flybys of europa but is more focused on ganymede
europa clipper — in july 2013 an updated concept for a flyby europa mission called europa clipper was presented by the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the applied physics laboratory apl in may 2015 nasa announced that it had accepted development of the europa clipper mission and revealed the instruments it will use the aim of europa clipper is to explore europa in order to investigate its habitability and to aid selecting sites for a future lander the europa clipper would not orbit europa but instead orbit jupiter and conduct 45 low-altitude flybys of europa during its envisioned mission the probe would carry an ice-penetrating radar short-wave infrared spectrometer topographical imager and an ion- and neutral-mass spectrometer
europa lander nasa is a recent concept mission under study 2018 research suggests europa may be covered in tall jagged ice spikes presenting a problem for any potential landing on its surface


 old proposals 

in the early 2000s jupiter europa orbiter led by nasa and the jupiter ganymede orbiter led by the esa were proposed together as an outer planet flagship mission to jupiters icy moons called europa jupiter system mission with a planned launch in 2020 in 2009 it was given priority over titan saturn system mission at that time there was competition from other proposals japan proposed jupiter magnetospheric orbiter
jovian europa orbiter was an esa cosmic vision concept study from 2007 another concept was ice clipper which would have used an impactor similar to the deep impact mission—it would make a controlled crash into the surface of europa generating a plume of debris that would then be collected by a small spacecraft flying through the plumejupiter icy moons orbiter jimo was a partially developed fission-powered spacecraft with ion thrusters that was cancelled in 2006 it was part of project prometheus the europa lander mission proposed a small nuclear-powered europa lander for jimo it would travel with the orbiter which would also function as a communication relay to eartheuropa orbiter — its objective would be to characterize the extent of the ocean and its relation to the deeper interior instrument payload could include a radio subsystem laser altimeter magnetometer langmuir probe and a mapping camera the europa orbiter received a go-ahead in 1999 but was canceled in 2002 this orbiter featured a special ice-penetrating radar that would allow it to scan below the surfacemore ambitious ideas have been put forward including an impactor in combination with a thermal drill to search for biosignatures that might be frozen in the shallow subsurfaceanother proposal put forward in 2001 calls for a large nuclear-powered melt probe cryobot that would melt through the ice until it reached an ocean below once it reached the water it would deploy an autonomous underwater vehicle hydrobot that would gather information and send it back to earth both the cryobot and the hydrobot would have to undergo some form of extreme sterilization to prevent detection of earth organisms instead of native life and to prevent contamination of the subsurface ocean this suggested approach has not yet reached a formal conceptual planning stage


 habitability potential 

so far there is no evidence that life exists on europa but europa has emerged as one of the most likely locations in the solar system for potential habitability life could exist in its under-ice ocean perhaps in an environment similar to earths deep-ocean hydrothermal vents even if europa lacks volcanic hydrothermal activity a 2016 nasa study found that earth-like levels of hydrogen and oxygen could be produced through processes related to serpentinization and ice-derived oxidants which do not directly involve volcanism in 2015 scientists announced that salt from a subsurface ocean may likely be coating some geological features on europa suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor this may be important in determining if europa could be habitable the likely presence of liquid water in contact with europas rocky mantle has spurred calls to send a probe there

the energy provided by tidal forces drives active geological processes within europas interior just as they do to a far more obvious degree on its sister moon io although europa like the earth may possess an internal energy source from radioactive decay the energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source life on europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor or below the ocean floor where endoliths are known to inhabit on earth alternatively it could exist clinging to the lower surface of europas ice layer much like algae and bacteria in earths polar regions or float freely in europas ocean if europas ocean is too cold biological processes similar to those known on earth could not take place if it is too salty only extreme halophiles could survive in that environment in 2010 a model proposed by richard greenberg of the university of arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on europas surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide which could then be transported via tectonic processes into the interior ocean such a process could render europas ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12 million years allowing for the existence of complex multicellular lifeformsevidence suggests the existence of lakes of liquid water entirely encased in europas icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist farther down beneath the ice shell if confirmed the lakes could be yet another potential habitat for life evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide is abundant across much of the surface of europa because hydrogen peroxide decays into oxygen and water when combined with liquid water the authors argue that it could be an important energy supply for simple life forms
clay-like minerals specifically phyllosilicates often associated with organic matter on earth have been detected on the icy crust of europa the presence of the minerals may have been the result of a collision with an asteroid or comet some scientists have speculated that life on earth could have been blasted into space by asteroid collisions and arrived on the moons of jupiter in a process called lithopanspermia
