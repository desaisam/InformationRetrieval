the proceedings of the ieee is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal published by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee the journal focuses on electrical engineering and computer science according to the journal citation reports the journal has a 2017 impact factor of 9.107 ranking it sixth in the category engineering electrical  electronic


 history of the proceedings 
the journal was established in 1909 known as the proceedings of the wireless institute six issues were published under this banner by greenleaf pickard and alfred goldsmith then in 1911 a merger between the wireless institute new york and  the society of wireless telegraph engineers boston resulted in a society named the institute of radio engineers ire
in january 1913 newly formed ire published the first issue of the proceedings of the ire later a 1000-page special issue commemorated the ires fiftieth anniversary in may 1962 one of the founding editors alfred norton goldsmith tallied 42 years as the first editor-in-chief when the ieee was formed in 1963 as a merger of ire and the american institute of electrical engineers the journal obtained its current name


 journal content 
proceedings of the ieee provides in-depth review survey and tutorial coverage of the technical developments in electronics electrical and computer engineering and computer science 

reviews critically examine a technology tracing its progress from its inception to the present—and perhaps into the future
surveys comprehensively view a technology—its applications issues ramifications and potential
tutorials explain a technology and may give practical information for implementing itthe journal offers applications-oriented coverage that goes beyond the traditional boundaries typically found in other journals


 special issues and regular papers 
the journal publishes approximately ten special issues and two regular paper issues per year
special issues are led by distinguished guest editor teams and contain articles from leading experts in the technology area being covered they serve as a guide to the state-of-the-art and are highly valued by the core research community as well as specialists in other areas
regular paper issues consist of three to four papers on more focused topics giving readers background and insight into emerging areas
