457175 2008 go98 provisional designation 2008 go98 with cometary number 362p is a hildian asteroid and rare main-belt comet from the outermost regions of the asteroid belt approximately 15 kilometers 9 miles in diameter it was discovered on 8 april 2008 by astronomers of the spacewatch program at kitt peak national observatory near tucson arizona in the united states the presumably carbonaceous body has a rotation period of 10.7 hours


 orbit and classification 
2008 go98 is classified as a member of the dynamical hilda group as well as a main-belt comet that shows clear cometary activity which has also been described as a quasi hilda comet orbital backward integration suggests that it might have been a centaur or trans-neptunian object that ended its dynamical evolution as a quasi hilda cometit orbits the sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.9–5.1 au once every 7 years and 11 months 2,883 days semi-major axis of 3.96 au its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.28 and an inclination of 16° with respect to the ecliptic the bodys observation arc begins with a precovery taken by the sloan digital sky survey in october 2001 more than  5 years prior to its official discovery observation by spacewatch2008 go98 has a jupiter tisserands parameter tj of 2.926 just below jewitts threshold of 3 which serves as a distinction between the main-belt asteroids tj larger than 3 and the jupiter-family comets tj between 2 and 3


 numbering and naming 
this minor planet was numbered by the minor planet center on 16 february 2016 mpc 98587 as of 2018 it has not been named


 physical characteristics 
2008 go98 is an assumed c-type asteroid


 rotation period 
in august 2017 a rotational lightcurve of 2008 go98 was obtained from photometric observations by american astronomer brian warner at the palmer divide station u82 in california lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 10.74±0.01 hours with a small brightness amplitude of 0.12 magnitude u2


 diameter and albedo 
the collaborative asteroid lightcurve link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous body of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 14.64 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.9 other estimates taking into account several published magnitude measurements and a large range of albedo assumptions estimate a diameter range of 5.5 to 24.7 kilometers
