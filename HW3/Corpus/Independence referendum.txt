an independence referendum is a type of referendum in which the citizens of a territory decide whether the territory should become an independent sovereign state an independence referendum that results in a vote for independence does not always ultimately result in independence
the articles on specific referendums are linked with dates in the table on past referendums


 procedure 
an independence referendum typically arises first after political success for nationalists of a territory this could come in the election of politicians or parties with separatist policies or from pressure from nationalist organisations


 negotiations 
negotiations for the terms of an independence referendum may take place between the nationalists and the government which exercises sovereignty over the territory if terms can be agreed then the independence referendum can be held with its result binding and respected by the international community independence referendums can be held without the consent of governments but their results are usually ignored by the international community
various issues can be discussed in negotiations such as the date and timing of the poll as well as voter eligibility for these instances common electoral practice is often widely used although there can be deviations as seen with the lowering of the voting age for the 2014 scottish independence referendum
other issues to be negotiated include what question or questions should be on the ballot and what the voting options could be independence referendums can offer options of greater autonomy as well as or instead of the status quo they can also put forward other constitutional questions to ballot the questions that referendums ask may be revised if parties involved in negotiations consider them to be too leading
negotiations notably need to address what would make a result binding for some independence referendums a simple majority is required for one option in other cases a quota can be used where a certain percentage of the vote or the electorate needs to be in favour of an option for it to be binding

successful negotiations can be hard to achieve for nationalists as governments can be reluctant to give up sovereignty for example nationalists planned to hold a referendum in catalonia in 2014 but met opposition from the spanish government as a result the referendum that went ahead was unofficial and non-binding


 aftermath 
in the event of a vote for independence there may be negotiations on the terms of secession for the territory from the sovereign state a declaration of independence for a new state is then made and international recognition can follow as well as membership of international organisations such as the united nations in cases involving non-binding referendums this can lead to a unilateral declaration of independence and therefore partially recognised or self-proclaimed states
in the event of a vote against independence there may still be a strong nationalist movement and calls for there to be a rerun of the independence referendum for example after two referendums in quebec the parti québécois has continued to raise the prospect of holding another referendum and the scottish national party has said that there should be a repeat of the 2014 referendum if the united kingdom leaves the european union
