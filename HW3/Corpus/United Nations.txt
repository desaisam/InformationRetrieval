the uns mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades during the cold war between the united states and soviet union and their respective allies its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring reporting and confidence-building roles the organizations membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization which started in the 1960s since then 80 former colonies had gained independence including 11 trust territories which were monitored by the trusteeship council by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping after the end of the cold war the un shifted and expanded its field operations undertaking a wide variety of complex tasksthe un has six principal organs the general assembly the security council the economic and social council the trusteeship council the international court of justice and the un secretariat the un system agencies include the world bank group the world health organization the world food programme unesco and unicef the uns most prominent officer is the secretary-general an office held by portuguese politician and diplomat antónio guterres since 1 january 2017 non-governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ecosoc and other agencies to participate in the uns work
the organization its officers and its agencies have won many nobel peace prizes
other evaluations of the uns effectiveness have been mixed some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development while others have called the organization ineffective biased or corrupt


 history 


 background 
in the century prior to the uns creation several international treaty organizations such as the international committee of the red cross was formed to ensure protection and assistance for victims of armed conflict and strife
in 1914 a political assassination in sarajevo set off a chain of events that led to the outbreak of world war i as more and more young men were sent down into the trenches influential voices in the united states and britain began calling for the establishment of a permanent international body to maintain peace in the postwar world president woodrow wilson became a vocal advocate of this concept and in 1918 he included a sketch of the international body in his 14-point proposal to end the war in november 1918 the central powers agreed to an armistice to halt the killing in world war i two months later the allies met with germany and austria-hungary at versailles to hammer out formal peace terms president wilson wanted peace but england and france disagreed forcing harsh war reparations on their former enemies the league of nations was approved and in the summer of 1919 wilson presented the treaty of versailles and the covenant of the league of nations to the us senate for ratification on january 10 1920 the league of nations formally comes into being when the covenant of the league of nations ratified by 42 nations in 1919 takes effect 
however at some point the league became ineffective when it failed to act against the japanese invasion of manchuria as in february 1933 40 nations voted for japan to withdraw from manchuria but japan voted against it and walked out of the league instead of withdrawing from manchuria it also failed against the second italo-ethiopian war despite trying to talk to benito mussolini as he used the time to send an army to africa so the league had a plan for mussolini to just take a part of ethiopia but he ignored the league and invaded ethiopia the league tried putting sanctions on italy but italy had already conquered ethiopia and the league had failed after italy conquered ethiopia italy and other nations left the league but all of them realised that it had failed and they began to re-arm as fast as possible
during 1938 britain and france tried negotiating directly with hitler but this failed in 1939 when hitler invaded czechoslovakia
when war broke out in 1939 the league closed down and its headquarters in geneva remained empty throughout the war


 1942 declaration of united nations by the allies of world war ii 

the earliest concrete plan for a new world organization began under the aegis of the us state department in 1939 the text of the declaration by united nations was drafted at the white house on december 29 1941 by president franklin d roosevelt prime minister winston churchill and roosevelt aide harry hopkins it incorporated soviet suggestions but left no role for france four policemen was coined to refer to four major allied countries united states united kingdom soviet union and republic of china which emerged in the declaration by united nations roosevelt first coined the term united nations to describe the allied countries  on new years day 1942 president roosevelt prime minister churchill maxim litvinov of the ussr and t v soong of china signed a short document which later came to be known as the united nations declaration and the next day the representatives of twenty-two other nations added their signatures the term united nations was first officially used when 26 governments signed this declaration one major change from the atlantic charter was the addition of a provision for religious freedom which stalin approved after roosevelt insisted by 1 march 1945 21 additional states had signed

a joint declaration by the united states of america the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland the union of soviet socialist republics china australia belgium canada costa rica cuba czechoslovakia dominican republic el salvador greece guatemala haiti honduras india luxembourg netherlands new zealand nicaragua norway panama poland south africa yugoslavia

during the war the united nations became the official term for the allies to join countries had to sign the declaration and declare war on the axis


 founding 

the un was formulated and negotiated among the delegations from the allied big four the united states the united kingdom the soviet union and china at the dumbarton oaks conference from 21 september 1944 to october 7 1944 and they agreed on the aims structure and functioning of the un after months of planning the un conference on international organization opened in san francisco 25 april 1945 attended by 50 governments and a number of non-governmental organizations involved in drafting the un charter the heads of the delegations of the sponsoring countries took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings anthony eden of britain edward stettinius of the united states t v soong of china and vyacheslav molotov of the soviet union at the later meetings lord halifax deputized for mister eden wellington koo for t v soong and mister gromyko for mister molotov the un officially came into existence 24 october 1945 upon ratification of the charter by the five permanent members of the security council—france the republic of china the soviet union the uk and the us—and by a majority of the other 46 signatoriesthe first meetings of the general assembly with 51 nations represented and the security council took place in methodist central hall westminster london beginning on 10 january 1946 the general assembly selected new york city as the site for the headquarters of the un construction began on 14 september 1948 and the facility was completed on 9 october 1952 its site—like un headquarters buildings in geneva vienna and nairobi—is designated as international territory the norwegian foreign minister trygve lie was elected as the first un secretary-general


 cold war era 

though the uns primary mandate was peacekeeping the division between the us and ussr often paralysed the organization generally allowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant from the cold war two notable exceptions were a security council resolution on 7 july 1950 authorizing a us-led coalition to repel the north korean invasion of south korea passed in the absence of the ussr and the signing of the korean armistice agreement in 27 july 1953on 29 november 1947 the general assembly approved a resolution to partition palestine approving the creation of the state of israel two years later ralph bunche a un official negotiated an armistice to the resulting conflict on november 7 1956 the first un peacekeeping force was established to end the suez crisis however the un was unable to intervene against the ussrs simultaneous invasion of hungary following that countrys revolutionon 14 july 1960 the un established united nations operation in the congo unoc the largest military force of its early decades to bring order to the breakaway state of katanga restoring it to the control of the democratic republic of the congo by 11 may 1964 while travelling to meet rebel leader moise tshombe during the conflict dag hammarskjöld often named as one of the uns most effective secretaries-general died in a plane crash months later he was posthumously awarded the nobel peace prize in 1964 hammarskjölds successor u thant deployed the un peacekeeping force in cyprus which would become one of the uns longest-running peacekeeping missionswith the spread of decolonization in the 1960s the organizations membership saw an influx of newly independent nations in 1960 alone 17 new states joined the un 16 of them from africa on 25 october 1971 with opposition from the united states but with the support of many third world nations the mainland communist peoples republic of china was given the chinese seat on the security council in place of the republic of china that occupied taiwan the vote was widely seen as a sign of waning us influence in the organization third world nations organized into the group of 77 coalition under the leadership of algeria which briefly became a dominant power at the un on 10 november 1975 a bloc comprising the ussr and third world nations passed a resolution over strenuous us and israeli opposition declaring zionism to be racism the resolution was repealed on 16 december 1991 shortly after the end of the cold warwith an increasing third world presence and the failure of un mediation in conflicts in the middle east vietnam and kashmir the un increasingly shifted its attention to its ostensibly secondary goals of economic development and cultural exchange by the 1970s the un budget for social and economic development was far greater than its peacekeeping budget


 post-cold war 

after the cold war the un saw a radical expansion in its peacekeeping duties taking on more missions in ten years than it had in the previous four decades between 1988 and 2000 the number of adopted security council resolutions more than doubled and the peacekeeping budget increased more than tenfold the un negotiated an end to the salvadoran civil war launched a successful peacekeeping mission in namibia and oversaw democratic elections in post-apartheid south africa and post-khmer rouge cambodia in 1991 the un authorized a us-led coalition that repulsed the iraqi invasion of kuwait brian urquhart under-secretary-general from 1971 to 1985 later described the hopes raised by these successes as a false renaissance for the organization given the more troubled missions that followedthough the un charter had been written primarily to prevent aggression by one nation against another in the early 1990s the un faced a number of simultaneous serious crises within nations such as somalia haiti mozambique and the former yugoslavia the un mission in somalia was widely viewed as a failure after the us withdrawal following casualties in the battle of mogadishu and the un mission to bosnia faced worldwide ridicule for its indecisive and confused mission in the face of ethnic cleansing in 1994 the un assistance mission for rwanda failed to intervene in the rwandan genocide amid indecision in the security councilbeginning in the last decades of the cold war american and european critics of the un condemned the organization for perceived mismanagement and corruption in 1984 the us president ronald reagan withdrew his nations funding from unesco the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization founded 1946 over allegations of mismanagement followed by britain and singapore boutros boutros-ghali secretary-general from 1992 to 1996 initiated a reform of the secretariat reducing the size of the organization somewhat his successor kofi annan 1997–2006 initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the united states to withhold its un duesin the late 1990s and 2000s international interventions authorized by the un took a wider variety of forms the un mission in the sierra leone civil war of 1991–2002 was supplemented by british royal marines and the invasion of afghanistan in 2001 was overseen by natoin 2003 the united states invaded iraq despite failing to pass a un security council resolution for authorization prompting a new round of questioning of the organizations effectiveness under the eighth secretary-general ban ki-moon the un has intervened with peacekeepers in crises including the war in darfur in sudan and the kivu conflict in the democratic republic of congo and sent observers and chemical weapons inspectors to the syrian civil war in 2013 an internal review of un actions in the final battles of the sri lankan civil war in 2009 concluded that the organization had suffered systemic failure one hundred and one un personnel died in the 2010 haiti earthquake the worst loss of life in the organizations historythe millennium summit was held in 2000 to discuss the uns role in the 21st century the three day meeting was the largest gathering of world leaders in history and culminated in the adoption by all member states of the millennium development goals mdgs a commitment to achieve international development in areas such as poverty reduction gender equality and public health progress towards these goals which were to be met by 2015 was ultimately uneven the 2005 world summit reaffirmed the uns focus on promoting development peacekeeping human rights and global security the sustainable development goals were launched in 2015 to succeed the millennium development goalsin addition to addressing global challenges the un has sought to improve its accountability and democratic legitimacy by engaging more with civil society and fostering a global constituency in an effort to enhance transparency in 2016 the organization held its first public debate between candidates for secretary-general on 1 january 2017 portuguese diplomat antónio guterres who previously served as un high commissioner for refugees became the ninth secretary-general guterres has highlighted several key goals for his administration including an emphasis on diplomacy for preventing conflicts more effective peacekeeping efforts and streamlining the organization to be more responsive and versatile to global needs

 objectives 


 peacekeeping and security 

the un after approval by the security council sends peacekeepers to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities since the un does not maintain its own military peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states these soldiers are sometimes nicknamed blue helmets for their distinctive gear the peacekeeping force as a whole received the nobel peace prize in 1988in september 2013 the un had peacekeeping soldiers deployed on 15 missions the largest was the united nations organization stabilization mission in the democratic republic of the congo monusco which included 20,688 uniformed personnel the smallest united nations military observer group in india and pakistan unmogip included 42 uniformed personnel responsible for monitoring the ceasefire in jammu and kashmir un peacekeepers with the united nations truce supervision organization untso have been stationed in the middle east since 1948 the longest-running active peacekeeping missiona study by the rand corporation in 2005 found the un to be successful in two out of three peacekeeping efforts it compared efforts at nation-building by the un to those of the united states and found that seven out of eight un cases are at peace as compared with four out of eight us cases at peace also in 2005 the human security report documented a decline in the number of wars genocides and human rights abuses since the end of the cold war and presented evidence albeit circumstantial that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the un—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period situations in which the un has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the korean war 1950–53 and the authorization of intervention in iraq after the gulf war 1990–91

the un has also drawn criticism for perceived failures in many cases member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce security council resolutions disagreements in the security council about military action and intervention are seen as having failed to prevent the bangladesh genocide in 1971 the cambodian genocide in the 1970s and the rwandan genocide in 1994 similarly un inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the srebrenica massacre in 1995 or complete the peacekeeping operations in 1992–93 during the somali civil war un peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape soliciting prostitutes and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the democratic republic of the congo haiti liberia sudan and what is now south sudan burundi and ivory coast scientists cited un peacekeepers from nepal as the likely source of the 2010–13 haiti cholera outbreak which killed more than 8,000 haitians following the 2010 haiti earthquakein addition to peacekeeping the un is also active in encouraging disarmament regulation of armaments was included in the writing of the un charter in 1945 and was envisioned as a way of limiting the use of human and economic resources for their creation the advent of nuclear weapons came only weeks after the signing of the charter resulting in the first resolution of the first general assembly meeting calling for specific proposals for the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction the un has been involved with arms-limitation treaties such as the outer space treaty 1967 the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons 1968 the seabed arms control treaty 1971 the biological weapons convention 1972 the chemical weapons convention 1992 and the ottawa treaty 1997 which prohibits landmines three un bodies oversee arms proliferation issues the international atomic energy agency the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons and the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty organization preparatory commission


 human rights 
one of the uns primary purposes is promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race sex language or religion and member states pledge to undertake joint and separate action to protect these rights

in 1948 the general assembly adopted a universal declaration of human rights drafted by a committee headed by american diplomat and activist eleanor roosevelt and including the french lawyer rené cassin the document proclaims basic civil political and economic rights common to all human beings though its effectiveness towards achieving these ends has been disputed since its drafting the declaration serves as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations rather than a legally binding document but it has become the basis of two binding treaties the 1966 international covenant on civil and political rights and international covenant on economic social and cultural rights in practice the un is unable to take significant action against human rights abuses without a security council resolution though it does substantial work in investigating and reporting abusesin 1979 the general assembly adopted the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women followed by the convention on the rights of the child in 1989 with the end of the cold war the push for human rights action took on new impetus the united nations commission on human rights was formed in 1993 to oversee human rights issues for the un following the recommendation of that years world conference on human rights jacques fomerand a scholar of the un describes this organizations mandate as broad and vague with only meagre resources to carry it out in 2006 it was replaced by a human rights council consisting of 47 nations also in 2006 the general assembly passed a declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples and in 2011 it passed its first resolution recognizing the rights of lgbt peopleother un bodies responsible for womens rights issues include united nations commission on the status of women a commission of ecosoc founded in 1946 the united nations development fund for women created in 1976 and the united nations international research and training institute for the advancement of women founded in 1979 the un permanent forum on indigenous issues one of three bodies with a mandate to oversee issues related to indigenous peoples held its first session in 2002


 economic development and humanitarian assistance 
another primary purpose of the un is to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic social cultural or humanitarian character numerous bodies have been created to work towards this goal primarily under the authority of the general assembly and ecosoc in 2000 the 192 un member states agreed to achieve eight millennium development goals by 2015 the sustainable development goals were launched in 2015 to succeed the millennium development goals the sdgs have an associated financing framework called the addis ababa action agenda
the un development programme undp an organization for grant-based technical assistance founded in 1945 is one of the leading bodies in the field of international development the organization also publishes the un human development index a comparative measure ranking countries by poverty literacy education life expectancy and other factors the food and agriculture organization fao also founded in 1945 promotes agricultural development and food security unicef the united nations childrens fund was created in 1946 to aid european children after the second world war and expanded its mission to provide aid around the world and to uphold the convention on the rights of the child

the world bank group and international monetary fund imf are independent specialized agencies and observers within the un framework according to a 1947 agreement they were initially formed separately from the un through the bretton woods agreement in 1944 the world bank provides loans for international development while the imf promotes international economic co-operation and gives emergency loans to indebted countries

the world health organization who which focuses on international health issues and disease eradication is another of the uns largest agencies in 1980 the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed in subsequent decades who largely eradicated polio river blindness and leprosy the joint united nations programme on hivaids unaids begun in 1996 co-ordinates the organizations response to the aids epidemic the un population fund which also dedicates part of its resources to combating hiv is the worlds largest source of funding for reproductive health and family planning servicesalong with the international red cross and red crescent movement the un often takes a leading role in co-ordinating emergency relief the world food programme wfp created in 1961 provides food aid in response to famine natural disasters and armed conflict the organization reports that it feeds an average of 90 million people in 80 nations each year the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr established in 1950 works to protect the rights of refugees asylum seekers and stateless people unhcr and wfp programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments corporations and individuals though the unhcrs administrative costs are paid for by the uns primary budget


 other 
since the uns creation over 80 colonies have attained independence the general assembly adopted the declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples in 1960 with no votes against but abstentions from all major colonial powers the un works towards decolonization through groups including the un committee on decolonization created in 1962 the committee lists seventeen remaining non-self-governing territories the largest and most populous of which is western saharabeginning with the formation of the un environmental programme unep in 1972 the un has made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda a lack of success in the first two decades of un work in this area led to the 1992 earth summit in rio de janeiro brazil which sought to give new impetus to these efforts in 1988 the unep and the world meteorological organization wmo another un organization established the intergovernmental panel on climate change which assesses and reports on research on global warming the un-sponsored kyoto protocol signed in 1997 set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying statesthe un also declares and co-ordinates international observances periods of time to observe issues of international interest or concern examples include world tuberculosis day earth day and the international year of deserts and desertification


 funding 
the un is financed from assessed and voluntary contributions from member states the general assembly approves the regular budget and determines the assessment for each member this is broadly based on the relative capacity of each country to pay as measured by its gross national income gni with adjustments for external debt and low per capita income the two-year budget for 2012–13 was 5.512 billion in totalthe assembly has established the principle that the un should not be unduly dependent on any one member to finance its operations thus there is a ceiling rate setting the maximum amount that any member can be assessed for the regular budget in december 2000 the assembly revised the scale of assessments in response to pressure from the united states as part of that revision the regular budget ceiling was reduced from 25% to 22 for the least developed countries ldcs a ceiling rate of 0.01% is applied in addition to the ceiling rates the minimum amount assessed to any member nation or floor rate is set at 0.001% of the un budget 55,120 for the two year budget 2013–2014a large share of the uns expenditure addresses its core mission of peace and security and this budget is assessed separately from the main organizational budget the peacekeeping budget for the 2015–16 fiscal year was 8.27 billion supporting 82,318 troops deployed in 15 missions around the world un peace operations are funded by assessments using a formula derived from the regular funding scale that includes a weighted surcharge for the five permanent security council members who must approve all peacekeeping operations this surcharge serves to offset discounted peacekeeping assessment rates for less developed countries in 2017 the top eight providers of assessed financial contributions to un peacekeeping operations were the united states  28.47 china  10.25 japan  9.68 germany  6.39 france  6.28 united kingdom  5.77 russian federation  3.99 and italy  3.75special un programmes not included in the regular budget such as unicef and the world food programme are financed by voluntary contributions from member governments corporations and private individuals

a number of agencies and individuals associated with the un have won the nobel peace prize in recognition of their work two secretaries-general dag hammarskjöld and kofi annan were each awarded the prize in 1961 and 2001 respectively as were ralph bunche 1950 a un negotiator rené cassin 1968 a contributor to the universal declaration of human rights and the us secretary of state cordell hull 1945 the latter for his role in the organizations founding lester b pearson the canadian secretary of state for external affairs was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the uns first peacekeeping force to resolve the suez crisis unicef won the prize in 1965 the international labour organization in 1969 the un peace-keeping forces in 1988 the international atomic energy agency which reports to the un in 2005 and the un-supported organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons in 2013 the un high commissioner for refugees was awarded in 1954 and 1981 becoming one of only two recipients to win the prize twice the un as a whole was awarded the prize in 2001 sharing it with annan in 2007 ipcc received the prize for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change

since its founding there have been many calls for reform of the un but little consensus on how to do so some want the un to play a greater or more effective role in world affairs while others want its role reduced to humanitarian work there have also been numerous calls for the un security councils membership to be increased for different ways of electing the uns secretary-general and for a un parliamentary assembly jacques fomerand states the most enduring divide in views of the un is the north–south split between richer northern nations and developing southern nations southern nations tend to favour a more empowered un with a stronger general assembly allowing them a greater voice in world affairs while northern nations prefer an economically laissez-faire un that focuses on transnational threats such as terrorismafter world war ii the french committee of national liberation was late to be recognized by the us as the government of france and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that created the new organization the future french president charles de gaulle criticized the un famously calling it a machin contraption and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help maintain world peace preferring direct defence treaties between countries throughout the cold war both the us and ussr repeatedly accused the un of favouring the other in 1953 the ussr effectively forced the resignation of trygve lie the secretary-general through its refusal to deal with him while in the 1950s and 1960s a popular us bumper sticker read you cant spell communism without un in a sometimes-misquoted statement president george w bush stated in february 2003 referring to un uncertainty towards iraqi provocations under the saddam hussein regime that free nations will not allow the un to fade into history as an ineffective irrelevant debating society in contrast the french president françois hollande stated in 2012 that france trusts the united nations she knows that no state no matter how powerful can solve urgent problems fight for development and bring an end to all crises  france wants the un to be the centre of global governance critics such as dore gold an israeli diplomat robert s wistrich a british scholar alan dershowitz an american legal scholar mark dreyfus an australian politician and the anti-defamation league consider un attention to israels treatment of palestinians to be excessive in september 2015 saudi arabias faisal bin hassan trad has been elected chair of the un human rights council panel that appoints independent experts a move criticized by human rights groupssince 1971 the republic of china on taiwan has been excluded from the un and since then has always been rejected in new applications taiwanese citizens are also not allowed to enter the buildings of the united nations with roc passports in this way critics agree that the un is failing its own development goals and guidelines this criticism also brought pressure from the peoples republic of china which regards the territories administered by the roc as their own territorycritics have also accused the un of bureaucratic inefficiency waste and corruption in 1976 the general assembly established the joint inspection unit to seek out inefficiencies within the un system during the 1990s the us withheld dues citing inefficiency and only started repayment on the condition that a major reforms initiative was introduced in 1994 the office of internal oversight services oios was established by the general assembly to serve as an efficiency watchdog in 1994 former special representative of the secretary-general of the un to somalia mohamed sahnoun published somalia the missed opportunities a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 un intervention in somalia showing that between the start of the somali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the siad barre regime in january 1991 the un missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies when the un tried to provide humanitarian assistance they were totally outperformed by ngos whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the uns excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies if radical reform was not undertaken warned mohamed sahnoun then the un would continue to respond to such crisis with inept improvization in 2004 the un faced accusations that its recently ended oil-for-food programme—in which iraq had been allowed to trade oil for basic needs to relieve the pressure of sanctions—had suffered from widespread corruption including billions of dollars of kickbacks an independent inquiry created by the un found that many of its officials had been involved as well as raising significant questions about the role of kojo annan the son of kofi annanin evaluating the un as a whole jacques fomerand writes that the accomplishments of the united nations in the last 60 years are impressive in their own terms progress in human development during the 20th century has been dramatic and the un and its agencies have certainly helped the world become a more hospitable and livable place for millions evaluating the first 50 years of the uns history the author stanley meisler writes that the united nations never fulfilled the hopes of its founders but it accomplished a great deal nevertheless citing its role in decolonization and its many successful peacekeeping efforts the british historian paul kennedy states that while the organization has suffered some major setbacks when all its aspects are considered the un has brought great benefits to our generation and  will bring benefits to our childrens and grandchildrens generations as well
