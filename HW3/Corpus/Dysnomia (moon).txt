dysnomia greek δυσνομία—officially 136199 eris i dysnomia—is the only known moon of the dwarf planet eris the most massive known dwarf planet in the solar system it was discovered in 2005 by mike brown and the laser guide star adaptive optics team at the w m keck observatory and carried the provisional designation of s2005 2003 ub313 1 until officially named dysnomia from the ancient greek word δυσνομία meaning anarchylawlessness after the daughter of the greek goddess eris


 discovery 
during 2005 the adaptive optics team at the keck telescopes in hawaii carried out observations of the four brightest kuiper belt objects pluto makemake haumea and eris using the newly commissioned laser guide star adaptive optics system observations taken on 10 september revealed a moon in orbit around eris provisionally designated s2005 2003 ub313 1 in keeping with the xena nickname that was already in use for eris the moon was nicknamed gabrielle by its discoverers after xenas sidekick


 properties 
dysnomia has an estimated diameter of 700 ± 115 km with an albedo of 0.040.02−0.01 the estimate was obtained using radiometric observation by alma observatory in submillimeter spectral regionin its discovery images dysnomia was 60 times fainter or 4.43 magnitudes than eris in the k band and later observations with the hubble space telescope found it to be 500 times fainter in the visible band this indicates a very different and quite redder spectrum indicating a significantly darker surface its diameter reveals it to be a rather large trans-neptunian object of the known moons of dwarf and minor planets only charon is larger than dysnomia
combining keck and hubble observations the satellite was used to determine the mass of eris and orbital parameters were estimated its orbital period is calculated to be 15.774±0.002 d these observations indicate that dysnomia has a circular orbit around eris with a radius of 37350±140 km this shows that the mass of eris is 1.27 times that of pluto


 formation 
astronomers now know that the four brightest kuiper belt objects kbos have satellites among the fainter members of the belt only about 10% are known to have satellites this is thought to imply that collisions between large kbos have been frequent in the past impacts between bodies of the order of 1000 km across would throw off large amounts of material that would coalesce into a moon a similar mechanism is thought to have led to the formation of the moon when earth was struck by a giant impactor early in the history of the solar system


 name 

mike brown the moons discoverer chose the name dysnomia greek δυσνομία due to a number of associations it had for him dysnomia the daughter of eris fits the general historically established pattern of naming moons after lesser gods associated with the primary god hence jupiters largest moons are named after lovers of jupiter both male and female while saturns are named after his fellow titans also the english translation of dysnomia lawlessness echoes lucy lawless the actress famous for starring in xena warrior princess on television before receiving their official names eris and dysnomia were nicknamed xena and gabrielle and brown decided to retain that connection
brown also notes that pluto owes its name in part to its first two letters which form the initials of percival lowell the founder of the observatory where its discoverer clyde tombaugh was working and the person who inspired the search for planet x james christy who discovered charon followed the principle established with pluto by choosing a name which shared its first four letters with his wifes name charlene dysnomia similarly has the same first letter as browns wife diane and brown uses the nickname dy ˈdaɪ for the moon which he pronounces the same as his wifes nickname di because of this brown pronounces the full name  with a long y
