the local interstellar cloud lic also known as the local fluff is the interstellar cloud roughly 30 light-years 9.2 pc across through which the solar system is currently moving it is currently unknown if the sun is embedded in the local interstellar cloud or in the region where the local interstellar cloud is interacting with the neighboring g-cloud


 structure 
the solar system is located within a structure called the local bubble a low-density region of the galactic interstellar medium  within this region is the local interstellar cloud a region of slightly higher hydrogen density the sun is near the edge of the local interstellar cloud it is thought to have entered the region at some point between 44,000 and 150,000 years ago and is expected to remain within it for another 10,000 to 20,000 years
the cloud has a temperature of about 7,000 k 6,730 °c 12,140 °f about the same temperature as the surface of the sun however its specific heat capacity is very low because it is not very dense with 0.3 atoms per cubic centimetre 4.9cu in this is less dense than the average for the interstellar medium in the milky way 0.5cm3 or 8.2cu in though six times denser than the gas in the hot low-density local bubble 0.05cm3 or 0.82cu in which surrounds the local cloud in comparison earths atmosphere at the edge of space has around 1.2×1013 molecules per cubic centimeter dropping to around 50 million 5.0×107 at 450 km 280 mithe cloud is flowing outwards from the scorpius–centaurus association a stellar association that is a star-forming region


 interaction with solar magnetic field 
in 2009 voyager 2 data suggested that the magnetic strength of the local interstellar medium was much stronger than expected 370 to 550 picoteslas pt against previous estimates of 180 to 250 pt the fact that the local interstellar cloud is strongly magnetized could explain its continued existence despite the pressures exerted upon it by the winds that blew out the local bubblethe local interstellar clouds potential effects on earth are prevented by the solar wind and the suns magnetic field this interaction with the heliosphere is under study by the interstellar boundary explorer ibex a nasa satellite mapping the boundary between the solar system and interstellar space
