modern humans first arrived in the iberian peninsula around 35,000 years ago iberian cultures along with ancient phoenician greek celtic and carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under roman rule around 200 bce after which the region was named hispania based on the earlier phoenician name span or spania at the end of the western roman empire the germanic tribal confederations migrated from central europe invaded the iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces including the suebi alans and vandals eventually the visigoths would forcibly integrate all remaining independent territories in the peninsula including byzantine provinces into the kingdom of toledo which more or less unified politically ecclesiastically and legally all the former roman provinces or successor kingdoms of what was then documented as hispania
in the early eighth century the visigothic kingdom fell to the moors of the umayyad islamic caliphate who arrived to rule most of the peninsula in the year 726 leaving only a handful of small christian realms in the north and lasting up to seven centuries in the kingdom of granada this led to many wars during a long reconquering period across the iberian peninsula which led to the creation of kingdom of leon kingdom of castille kingdom of aragon and kingdom of navarre as the main christian kingdoms to face the invasion following the moorish conquest europeans began a gradual process of retaking the region known as the reconquista which by the late 15th century culminated in the emergence of spain as a unified country under the catholic monarchs
in the early modern period spain became the worlds first global empire and the most powerful country in the world leaving a large cultural and linguistic legacy that includes 570 million hispanophones making spanish the worlds second-most spoken native language after mandarin chinese during the golden age there were also many advancements in the arts with world-famous painters such as diego velázquez

 etymology 
the origins of the roman name hispania from which the modern name españa was derived are uncertain due to inadequate evidence although it is documented that the phoenicians and carthaginians referred to the region as spania therefore the most widely accepted etymology is a semitic-phoenician one down the centuries there have been a number of accounts and hypotheses

the renaissance scholar antonio de nebrija proposed that the word hispania evolved from the iberian word hispalis meaning city of the western world
jesús luis cunchillos argues that the root of the term span is the phoenician word spy meaning to forge metals therefore i-spn-ya would mean the land where metals are forged it may be a derivation of the phoenician i-shpania meaning island of rabbits land of rabbits or edge a reference to spains location at the end of the mediterranean roman coins struck in the region from the reign of hadrian show a female figure with a rabbit at her feet and strabo called it the land of the rabbits the word in question compare modern hebrew shafan actually means hyrax possibly due to phoenicians confusing the two animalshispania may derive from the poetic use of the term hesperia reflecting the greek perception of italy as a western land or land of the setting sun hesperia ἑσπερία in greek and spain being still further west as hesperia ultimathere is the claim that hispania derives from the basque word ezpanna meaning edge or border another reference to the fact that the iberian peninsula constitutes the southwest corner of the european continenttwo 15th-century spanish jewish scholars don isaac abravanel and solomon ibn verga gave an explanation now considered folkloric both men wrote in two different published works that the first jews to reach spain were brought by ship by phiros who was confederate with the king of babylon when he laid siege to jerusalem phiros was a grecian by birth but who had been given a kingdom in spain phiros became related by marriage to espan the nephew of king heracles who also ruled over a kingdom in spain heracles later renounced his throne in preference for his native greece leaving his kingdom to his nephew espan from whom the country of españa spain took its name based upon their testimonies this eponym would have already been in use in spain by c 350 bce


 history 

iberia enters written records as a land populated largely by the iberians basques and celts early on its coastal areas were settled by phoenicians who founded western europes most ancient cities cadiz and malaga phoenician influence expanded as much of the peninsula was eventually incorporated into the carthaginian empire becoming a major theatre of the punic wars against the expanding roman empire after an arduous conquest the peninsula came fully under roman rule during the early middle ages it came under gothic rule but later much of it was conquered by muslim invaders from north africa in a process that took centuries the small christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula the last muslim state fell in the same year columbus reached the americas a global empire began which saw spain become the strongest kingdom in europe the leading world power for a century and a half and the largest overseas empire for three centuries
continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status the napoleonic invasions of spain led to chaos triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable prior to the second world war spain suffered a devastating civil war and came under the rule of an authoritarian government which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy eventually democracy was peacefully restored in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy spain joined the european union experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth until the beginning of the 21st century that started a new globalised world with economic and ecological challenges


 prehistory and pre-roman peoples 

archaeological research at atapuerca indicates the iberian peninsula was populated by hominids 1.2 million years ago in atapuerca fossils have been found of the earliest known hominins in europe the homo antecessor modern humans first arrived in iberia from the north on foot about 35,000 years ago the best known artefacts of these prehistoric human settlements are the famous paintings in the altamira cave of cantabria in northern iberia which were created from 35,600 to 13,500 bce by cro-magnon archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the iberian peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern europe was repopulated following the end of the last ice age
the largest groups inhabiting the iberian peninsula before the roman conquest were the iberians and the celts the iberians inhabited the mediterranean side of the peninsula from the northeast to the southeast the celts inhabited much of the inner and atlantic sides of the peninsula from the northwest to the southwest basques occupied the western area of the pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas the phoenician-influenced tartessians culture flourished in the southwest and the lusitanians and vettones occupied areas in the central west a number of cities were founded along the coast by phoenicians and trading outposts and colonies were established by greeks in the east eventually phoenician-carthaginians expanded inland towards the meseta however due to the bellicose inland tribes the carthaginians got settled in the coasts of the iberian peninsula


 roman hispania and the visigothic kingdom 

during the second punic war roughly between 210 and 205 bc the expanding roman republic captured carthaginian trading colonies along the mediterranean coast although it took the romans nearly two centuries to complete the conquest of the iberian peninsula they retained control of it for over six centuries roman rule was bound together by law language and the roman roadthe cultures of the celtic and iberian populations were gradually romanised latinised at different rates depending on what part of hispania they lived in with local leaders being admitted into the roman aristocratic class hispania served as a granary for the roman market and its harbours exported gold wool olive oil and wine agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects some of which remain in use emperors hadrian trajan theodosius i and the philosopher seneca were born in hispania christianity was introduced into hispania in the 1st century ad and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century ad most of spains present languages and religion and the basis of its laws originate from this period

the weakening of the western roman empires jurisdiction in hispania began in 409 when the germanic suebi and vandals together with the sarmatian alans entered the peninsula at the invitation of a roman usurper these tribes had crossed the rhine in early 407 and ravaged gaul the suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern galicia and northern portugal whereas the vandals established themselves in southern spain by 420 before crossing over to north africa in 429 and taking carthage in 439 as the western empire disintegrated the social and economic base became greatly simplified but even in modified form the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire including christianity and assimilation to the evolving roman culture

the byzantines established an occidental province spania in the south with the intention of reviving roman rule throughout iberia eventually however hispania was reunited under visigothic rule these visigoths or western goths after sacking rome under the leadership of alaric 410 turned towards the iberian peninsula with athaulf for their leader and occupied the northeastern portion wallia extended his rule over most of the peninsula keeping the suebians shut up in galicia theodoric i took part with the romans and franks in the battle of the catalaunian plains where attila was routed euric 466 who put an end to the last remnants of roman power in the peninsula may be considered the first monarch of spain though the suebians still maintained their independence in galicia euric was also the first king to give written laws to the visigoths in the following reigns the catholic kings of france assumed the role of protectors of the hispano-roman catholics against the arianism of the visigoths and in the wars which ensued alaric ii and amalaric lost their lives
athanagild having risen against king agila called in the byzantines and in payment for the succour they gave him ceded to them the maritime places of the southeast 554 liuvigild restored the political unity of the peninsula subduing the suebians but the religious divisions of the country reaching even the royal family brought on a civil war st hermengild the kings son putting himself at the head of the catholics was defeated and taken prisoner and suffered martyrdom for rejecting communion with the arians recared son of liuvigild and brother of st hermengild added religious unity to the political unity achieved by his father accepting the catholic faith in the third council of toledo 589 the religious unity established by this council was the basis of that fusion of goths with hispano-romans which produced the spanish nation sisebut and suintila completed the expulsion of the byzantines from spainintermarriage between visigoths and hispano-romans was prohibited though in practice it could not be entirely prevented and was eventually legalised by liuvigild the spanish-gothic scholars such as braulio of zaragoza and isidore of seville played an important role in keeping the classical greek and roman culture isidore was one of the most influential clerics and philosophers in the middle ages in europe and his theories were also vital to the conversion of the visigothic kingdom from an arian domain to a catholic one in the councils of toledo isidore created the first western encyclopaedia which had a huge impact during the middle ages


 muslim era and reconquista 

in the 8th century nearly all of the iberian peninsula was conquered 711–718 by largely moorish muslim armies from north africa these conquests were part of the expansion of the umayyad caliphate only a small area in the mountainous north-west of the peninsula managed to resist the initial invasion legend has it that count julian the governor of ceuta in revenge for the violation of his daughter florinda by king roderic invited the muslims and opened to them the gates of the peninsula
under islamic law christians and jews were given the subordinate status of dhimmi this status permitted christians and jews to practice their religions as people of the book but they were required to pay a special tax and had legal and social rights inferior to those of muslimsconversion to islam proceeded at an increasing pace the muladíes muslims of ethnic iberian origin are believed to have formed the majority of the population of al-andalus by the end of the 10th centurythe muslim community in the iberian peninsula was itself diverse and beset by social tensions the berber people of north africa who had provided the bulk of the invading armies clashed with the arab leadership from the middle east over time large moorish populations became established especially in the guadalquivir river valley the coastal plain of valencia the ebro river valley and towards the end of this period in the mountainous region of granada

córdoba the capital of the caliphate since abd-ar-rahman iii was the largest richest and most sophisticated city in western europe mediterranean trade and cultural exchange flourished muslims imported a rich intellectual tradition from the middle east and north africa some important philosophers at the time were averroes ibn arabi and maimonides the romanised cultures of the iberian peninsula interacted with muslim and jewish cultures in complex ways giving the region a distinctive culture outside the cities where the vast majority lived the land ownership system from roman times remained largely intact as muslim leaders rarely dispossessed landowners and the introduction of new crops and techniques led to an expansion of agriculture introducing new produces which originally came from asia or the former territories of the roman empirein the 11th century the muslim holdings fractured into rival taifa states arab berber and slav allowing the small christian states the opportunity to greatly enlarge their territories the arrival from north africa of the islamic ruling sects of the almoravids and the almohads restored unity upon the muslim holdings with a stricter less tolerant application of islam and saw a revival in muslim fortunes this re-united islamic state experienced more than a century of successes that partially reversed christian gains

the reconquista reconquest was the centuries-long period in which christian rule was re-established over the iberian peninsula the reconquista is viewed as beginning with the battle of covadonga won by don pelayo in 722 and was concurrent with the period of muslim rule on the iberian peninsula the christian armys victory over muslim forces led to the creation of the christian kingdom of asturias along the northwestern coastal mountains shortly after in 739 muslim forces were driven from galicia which was to eventually host one of medieval europes holiest sites santiago de compostela and was incorporated into the new christian kingdom the kingdom of león was the strongest christian kingdom for centuries in 1188 the first modern parliamentary session in europe was held in león cortes of león the kingdom of castile formed from leonese territory was its successor as strongest kingdom the kings and the nobility fought for power and influence in this period the example of the roman emperors influenced the political objective of the crown while the nobles benefited from feudalism
muslim armies had also moved north of the pyrenees but they were defeated by frankish forces at the battle of poitiers frankia and pushed out of the very southernmost region of france along the seacoast by the 760s later frankish forces established christian counties on the southern side of the pyrenees these areas were to grow into the kingdoms of navarre and aragon for several centuries the fluctuating frontier between the muslim and christian controlled areas of iberia was along the ebro and douro valleys

the county of barcelona and the kingdom of aragon entered in a dynastic union and gained territory and power in the mediterranean in 1229 majorca was conquered so was valencia in 1238 the break-up of al-andalus into the competing taifa kingdoms helped the long embattled iberian christian kingdoms gain the initiative the capture of the strategically central city of toledo in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the christian kingdoms following a great muslim resurgence in the 12th century the great moorish strongholds in the south fell to christian spain in the 13th century—córdoba in 1236 and seville in 1248 in the 13th and 14th centuries the marinid dynasty of morocco invaded and established some enclaves on the southern coast but failed in their attempt to re-establish north african rule in iberia and were soon driven out after 800 years of muslim presence in spain the last nasrid sultanate of granada a tributary state would finally surrender in 1492 to the catholic monarchs queen isabella i of castile and king ferdinand ii of aragon

from the mid 13th century literature and philosophy started to flourish again in the christian peninsular kingdoms based on roman and gothic traditions an important philosopher from this time is ramon llull abraham cresques was a prominent jewish cartographer roman law and its institutions were the model for the legislators the king alfonso x of castile focused on strengthening this roman and gothic past and also on linking the iberian christian kingdoms with the rest of medieval european christendom alfonso worked for being elected emperor of the holy roman empire and published the siete partidas code the toledo school of translators is the name that commonly describes the group of scholars who worked together in the city of toledo during the 12th and 13th centuries to translate many of the philosophical and scientific works from classical arabic ancient greek and ancient hebrew
the islamic transmission of the classics is the main islamic contributions to medieval europe the castilian language—more commonly known especially later in history and at present as spanish after becoming the national language and lingua franca of spain—evolved from vulgar latin as did other romance languages of spain like the catalan asturian and galician languages as well as other romance languages in latin europe basque the only non-romance language in spain continued evolving from early basque to medieval the glosas emilianenses founded in the monasteries of san millán de la cogolla contain the first written words in both basque and spanish having the first become an influence in the formation of the second as an evolution of latin

the 13th century also witnessed the crown of aragon centred in spains north east expand its reach across islands in the mediterranean to sicily and naples around this time the universities of palencia 1212/1263 and salamanca 1218/1254 were established the black death of 1348 and 1349 devastated spainthe catalans and aragonese offered themselves to the byzantine emperor andronicus ii palaeologus to fight the turks having conquered these they turned their arms against the byzantines who treacherously slew their leaders but for this treachery the spaniards under bernard of rocafort and berenguer of entenca exacted the terrible penalty celebrated in history as the catalan vengeance and moreover seized the frankish duchy of athens 1311 the royal line of aragon became extinct with martin the humane and the compromise of caspe gave the crown to the dynasty of castile thus preparing the final union
anti-semitic animus accompanied the reconquista there were mass killings in aragon in the mid-14th century and 12,000 jews were killed in toledo in 1391 christian mobs went from town to town throughout castile and aragon killing an estimated 50,000 jews women and children were sold as slaves to muslims and many synagogues were converted into churches according to hasdai crescas about 70 jewish communities were destroyed st vincent ferrer converted innumerable jews among them the rabbi josuah halorqui who took the name of jerónimo de santa fe and in his town converted many of his former coreligionists in the famous disputation of tortosa 1413–14


 spanish empire 

in 1469 the crowns of the christian kingdoms of castile and aragon were united by the marriage of isabella i of castile and ferdinand ii of aragon 1478 commenced the completion of the conquest of the canary islands and in 1492 the combined forces of castile and aragon captured the emirate of granada from its last ruler muhammad xii ending the last remnant of a 781-year presence of islamic rule in iberia
that same year spains jews were ordered to convert to catholicism or face expulsion from spanish territories during the spanish inquisition as many as 200,000 jews were expelled from spain this was followed by expulsions in 1493 in aragonese sicily and portugal in 1497 the treaty of granada guaranteed religious tolerance towards muslims for a few years before islam was outlawed in 1502 in the kingdom of castile and 1527 in the kingdom of aragon leading to spains muslim population becoming nominally christian moriscos a few decades after the morisco rebellion of granada known as the war of the alpujarras a significant proportion of spains formerly-muslim population was expelled settling primarily in north africa from 1609–14 over 300,000 moriscos were sent on ships to north africa and other locations and of this figure around 50,000 died resisting the expulsion and 60,000 died on the journeythe year 1492 also marked the arrival of christopher columbus in the new world during a voyage funded by isabella columbuss first voyage crossed the atlantic and reached the caribbean islands beginning the european exploration and conquest of the americas although columbus remained convinced that he had reached the orient large numbers of indigenous americans died in battle against the spaniards during the conquest while others died from various other causes some scholars consider the initial period of the spanish conquest— from columbuss first landing in the bahamas until the middle of the sixteenth century—as marking the most egregious case of genocide in the history of mankind the death toll may have reached some 70 million indigenous people out of 80 million in this period

the colonisation of the americas started with conquistadores like hernán cortés and francisco pizarro miscegenation was the rule between the native and the spanish cultures and people juan sebastian elcano completed the first voyage around the world in human history the magellan-elcano circumnavigation florida was colonised by pedro menéndez de avilés when he founded st augustine florida and then defeated an attempt led by the french captain jean ribault to establish a french foothold in spanish florida territory st augustine became a strategic defensive base for spanish ships full of gold and silver sailing to spain andrés de urdaneta discovered the tornaviaje or return route from the philippines to mexico making possible the manila galleon trading route the spanish once again encountered islam but this time in southeast asia and in order to incorporate the philippines spanish expeditions organised from newly christianised mexico had invaded the philippine territories of the sultanate of brunei the spanish considered the war with the muslims of brunei and the philippines a repeat of the reconquista the spanish explorer blas ruiz intervened in cambodias succession and installed crown prince barom reachea ii as puppetas renaissance new monarchs isabella and ferdinand centralised royal power at the expense of local nobility and the word españa whose root is the ancient name hispania began to be commonly used to designate the whole of the two kingdoms
with their wide-ranging political legal religious and military reforms spain emerged as the first world power the death of their son prince john caused the crown to pass to charles i the emperor charles v son of juana la loca
the unification of the crowns of aragon and castile by the marriage of their sovereigns laid the basis for modern spain and the spanish empire although each kingdom of spain remained a separate country socially politically legally and in currency and language

there were two big revolts against the new habsburg monarch and the more authoritarian and imperial-style crown revolt of the comuneros in castile and revolt of the brotherhoods in majorca and valencia after years of combat comuneros juan lópez de padilla juan bravo and francisco maldonado were executed and maría pacheco went into exile germana de foix also finished with the revolt in the mediterranean
habsburg spain was europes leading power throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions and became the worlds leading maritime power it reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two spanish habsburgs—charles i 1516–1556 and philip ii 1556–1598 this period saw the italian wars the schmalkaldic war the dutch revolt the war of the portuguese succession clashes with the ottomans intervention in the french wars of religion and the anglo-spanish war

through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance the spanish empire expanded to include vast areas in the americas islands in the asia-pacific area areas of italy cities in northern africa as well as parts of what are now france germany belgium luxembourg and the netherlands the first circumnavigation of the world was carried out in 1519–1521 it was the first empire on which it was said that the sun never set this was an age of discovery with daring explorations by sea and by land the opening-up of new trade routes across oceans conquests and the beginnings of european colonialism spanish explorers brought back precious metals spices luxuries and previously unknown plants and played a leading part in transforming the european understanding of the globe the cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the spanish golden age the expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from europe devastated american indigenous populations the rise of humanism the counter-reformation and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the school of salamanca which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as international law and human rights juan luis vives was another prominent humanist during this period

spains 16th century maritime supremacy was demonstrated by the victory over the ottomans at lepanto in 1571 and then after the setback of the spanish armada in 1588 in a series of victories against england in the anglo-spanish war of 1585–1604 however during the middle decades of the 17th century spains maritime power went into a long decline with mounting defeats against the united provinces and then england that by the 1660s it was struggling grimly to defend its overseas possessions from pirates and privateers
the protestant reformation dragged the kingdom ever more deeply into the mire of religiously charged wars the result was a country forced into ever expanding military efforts across europe and in the mediterranean by the middle decades of a war- and plague-ridden 17th-century europe the spanish habsburgs had enmeshed the country in continent-wide religious-political conflicts these conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the economy generally spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered habsburg empire and help the imperial forces of the holy roman empire reverse a large part of the advances made by protestant forces but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of portugal and the united provinces and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to france in the latter stages of the immensely destructive europe-wide thirty years war in the latter half of the 17th century spain went into a gradual decline during which it surrendered several small territories to france and england however it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century

the decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century the war of the spanish succession was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war and was to cost the kingdom its european possessions and its position as one of the leading powers on the continent
during this war a new dynasty originating in france the bourbons was installed long united only by the crown a true spanish state was established when the first bourbon king philip v united the crowns of castile and aragon into a single state abolishing many of the old regional privileges and lawsthe 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire the new bourbon monarchy drew on the french system of modernising the administration and the economy enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdoms elite and monarchy bourbon reformers created formal disciplined militias across the atlantic spain needed every hand it could take during the seemingly endless wars of the eighteenth century—the spanish war of succession or queen annes war 1702–13 the war of jenkins ear 1739–42 which became the war of the austrian succession 1740–48 the seven years war 1756–63 and the anglo-spanish war 1779–83—and its new disciplined militias served around the atlantic as needed


 liberalism labour movement and nation state 

in 1793 spain went to war against the revolutionary new french republic as a member of the first coalition the subsequent war of the pyrenees polarised the country in a reaction against the gallicised elites and following defeat in the field peace was made with france in 1795 at the peace of basel in which spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of hispaniola the prime minister manuel godoy then ensured that spain allied herself with france in the brief war of the third coalition which ended with the british naval victory at the battle of trafalgar in 1805 in 1807 a secret treaty between napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against britain and portugal napoleons troops entered the country to invade portugal but instead occupied spains major fortresses the spanish king abdicated in favour of napoleons brother joseph bonaparte
joseph bonaparte was seen as a puppet monarch and was regarded with scorn by the spanish the 2 may 1808 revolt was one of many nationalist uprisings across the country against the bonapartist regime these revolts marked the beginning of a devastating war of independence against the napoleonic regime the most celebrated battles of this war were those of bruch in the highlands of montserrat in which the catalan peasantry routed a french army bailén where castaños at the head of the army of andalusia defeated dupont and the sieges of zaragoza and girona which were worthy of the ancient spaniards of saguntum and numantianapoleon was forced to intervene personally defeating several spanish armies and forcing a british army to retreat however further military action by spanish armies guerrillas and wellingtons british-portuguese forces combined with napoleons disastrous invasion of russia led to the ousting of the french imperial armies from spain in 1814 and the return of king ferdinand vii

during the war in 1810 a revolutionary body the cortes of cádiz was assembled to co-ordinate the effort against the bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution it met as one body and its members represented the entire spanish empire in 1812 a constitution for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared but after the fall of the bonapartist regime ferdinand vii dismissed the cortes generales and was determined to rule as an absolute monarch these events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries
spains conquest by france benefited latin american anti-colonialists who resented the imperial spanish governments policies that favoured spanish-born citizens peninsulars over those born overseas criollos and demanded retroversion of the sovereignty to the people starting in 1809 spains american colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence leading to the spanish american wars of independence that ended spanish control over its mainland colonies in the americas king ferdinand viis attempt to re-assert control proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in spain and army revolts followed led by liberal officers by the end of 1826 the only american colonies spain held were cuba and puerto rico

the napoleonic war left spain economically ruined deeply divided and politically unstable in the 1830s and 1840s anti-liberal forces known as carlists fought against liberals in the carlist wars liberal forces won but the conflict between progressive and conservative liberals ended in a weak early constitutional period after the glorious revolution of 1868 and the short-lived first spanish republic a more stable monarchic period began characterised by the practice of turnismo the rotation of government control between progressive and conservative liberals within the spanish government

in the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the philippines and cuba in 1895 and 1896 the cuban war of independence and the philippine revolution broke out and eventually the united states became involved the spanish–american war was fought in the spring of 1898 and resulted in spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of north africa el desastre the disaster as the war became known in spain gave added impetus to the generation of 98 who were conducting an analysis of the country
although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity the 20th century brought little peace spain played a minor part in the scramble for africa with the colonisation of western sahara spanish morocco and equatorial guinea it remained neutral during world war i see spain in world war i the heavy losses suffered during the rif war in morocco brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy


 second spanish republic 

after a period of authoritarian rule under general miguel primo de rivera 1923–1931 the king determined to seek a solution to the political situation and establish the constitution the king led the municipal elections on 12 april 1931 these gave a resounding victory to the republican-socialist candidacies in large cities and provincial capitals while the total number of councillors was mostly monarchical the organised demonstrations demanding the establishment of a democratic republic led the king to leave the country and the proclamation of the same on 14 april of that same year during the second republic there was a great political and social upheaval marked by a sharp radicalisation of the left and the right the moderate leaders were boycotted and each party intended to create a spain to suit them during the first two years governed a coalition of republican and socialist parties in the elections held in 1933 the right triumphed and in 1936 the left the violent acts during this period included the burning of churches the monarchical uprising of the militar josé sanjurjo the revolution of 1934 and numerous attacks against rival political leaders on the other hand it is also during the second republic when important reforms are initiated to modernise the country – democratic constitution agrarian reform restructuring of the army first statutes of autonomy  – and the rights of citizens as the recognition of womens right to vote establishing universal suffrage
on 17 july and 18 1936 revolted against the government of the republic the military garrisons of the spanish north africa coup détat that triumphs only in part country spain was divided into two zones one under the authority of the republican government — in which the social revolution of 1936 – and other controlled by the insurgents took place the situation led to a civil war in which the general francisco franco was sworn in as the supreme leader of the insurgents


 spanish civil war and francoist spain 

the spanish civil war broke out in 1936 for three years the nationalist forces led by general francisco franco and supported by nazi germany and fascist italy fought the republican side which was supported by the soviet union mexico and international brigades but it was not supported by the western powers due to the british-led policy of non-intervention the civil war was viciously fought and there were many atrocities committed by all sides the war claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country in 1939 general franco emerged victorious and became a dictator

the state as established under franco was nominally neutral in the second world war although sympathetic to the axis the only legal party under francos post civil war regime was the falange española tradicionalista y de las jons formed in 1937 the party emphasised falangism a form of fascism that emphasised anti-communism nationalism and roman catholicism given francos opposition to competing political parties the party was renamed the national movement movimiento nacional in 1949
after world war ii spain was politically and economically isolated and was kept out of the united nations this changed in 1955 during the cold war period when it became strategically important for the us to establish a military presence on the iberian peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the soviet union into the mediterranean basin in the 1960s spain registered an unprecedented rate of economic growth which was propelled by industrialisation a mass internal migration from rural areas to madrid barcelona and the basque country and the creation of a mass tourism industry francos rule was also characterised by authoritarianism promotion of a unitary national identity the favouring of a very conservative form of roman catholicism known as national catholicism and discriminatory language policies


 restoration of democracy 

in 1962 a group of politicians involved in the opposition to francos regime inside the country and in the exile met in the congress of the european movement in munich where they made a resolution in favour of democracywith francos death in november 1975 juan carlos succeeded to the position of king of spain and head of state in accordance with the franquist law with the approval of the new spanish constitution of 1978 and the restoration of democracy the state devolved much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on autonomous communities the spanish 1977 amnesty law let people of francos regime continue inside institutions without consequences even perpetrators of some crimes during transition to democracy like the massacre of 3 march 1976 in vitoria or 1977 massacre of atocha the founding chairman of the current leading political party in spain the peoples party was manuel fraga who had been a minister in francos government and yet continued with his political career until shortly before his death in 2012

in the basque country moderate basque nationalism has coexisted with a radical nationalist movement led by the armed terrorist organisation eta the group was formed in 1959 during francos rule but has continued to wage its violent campaign even after the restoration of democracy and the return of a large measure of regional autonomy
on 23 february 1981 rebel elements among the security forces seized the cortes in an attempt to impose a military-backed government king juan carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters via national television to surrender
during the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society new cultural movements based on freedom appeared like la movida madrileña and a culture of human rights arose with gregorio peces-barba on 30 may 1982 spain joined nato followed by a referendum after a strong social opposition that year the spanish socialist workers party psoe came to power the first left-wing government in 43 years in 1986 spain joined the european economic community which later became the european union the psoe was replaced in government by the partido popular pp in 1996 after scandals around participation of the government of felipe gonzález in the dirty war against eta at that point the psoe had served almost 14 consecutive years in office
on 1 january 2002 spain fully adopted the euro and spain experienced strong economic growth well above the eu average during the early 2000s however well-publicised concerns issued by many economic commentators at the height of the boom warned that extraordinary property prices and a high foreign trade deficit were likely to lead to a painful economic collapse

in 2002 the prestige oil spill occurred with big ecological consequences along spains atlantic coastline in 2003 josé maría aznar supported us president george w bush in the iraq war and a strong movement against war rose in spanish society on 11 march 2004 a local islamist terrorist group inspired by al-qaeda carried out the largest terrorist attack in spanish history when they killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 others by bombing commuter trains in madrid though initial suspicions focused on the basque terrorist group eta evidence soon emerged indicating islamist involvement because of the proximity of the 2004 election the issue of responsibility quickly became a political controversy with the main competing parties pp and psoe exchanging accusations over the handling of the incident the elections on 14 march were won by the psoe led by josé luis rodríguez zapatero

the proportion of spains foreign born population increased rapidly during its economic boom in the early 2000s but then declined due to the financial crisis in 2005 the spanish government legalised same sex marriage decentralisation was supported with much resistance of constitutional court and conservative opposition so did gender politics like quotas or the law against gender violence government talks with eta happened and the group announced its permanent cease of violence in 2010
the bursting of the spanish property bubble in 2008 led to the 2008–16 spanish financial crisis and high levels of unemployment cuts in government spending and corruption in royal family and peoples party served as a backdrop to the 2011–12 spanish protests catalan independentism was also on rise in 2011 mariano rajoys conservative peoples party won the election with 44.6% of votes and rajoy became the spanish prime minister after having been the leader of the opposition from 2004 to 2011 and continued to implement austerity measures required by the eu stability and growth pact on 19 june 2014 the monarch juan carlos abdicated in favour of his son who became felipe vi
a catalan independence referendum was held on 1 october 2017 and then on 27 october the catalan parliament voted to unilaterally declare independence from spain to form a catalan republic on the day the spanish senate was discussing approving direct rule over catalonia as called for by the spanish prime minister later that day the senate granted the power to impose direct rule and mr rajoy dissolved the catalan parliament and called a new election no country recognised catalonia as a separate stateon 1 june 2018 the congress of deputies passed a motion of no-confidence against rajoy and replaced him with the psoe leader pedro sanchez thus bringing socialists back to power after 7 years

spain lies between latitudes 26° and 44° n and longitudes 19° w and 5° e
on the west spain is bordered by portugal on the south it is bordered by gibraltar a british overseas territory and morocco through its exclaves in north africa ceuta and melilla and the peninsula of vélez de la gomera on the northeast along the pyrenees mountain range it is bordered by france and the principality of andorra along the pyrenees in girona a small exclave town called llívia is surrounded by france
extending to 1,214 km 754 mi the portugal–spain border is the longest uninterrupted border within the european union


 islands 

spain also includes the balearic islands in the mediterranean sea the canary islands in the atlantic ocean and a number of uninhabited islands on the mediterranean side of the strait of gibraltar known as plazas de soberanía places of sovereignty or territories under spanish sovereignty such as the chafarinas islands and alhucemas the peninsula of vélez de la gomera is also regarded as a plaza de soberanía the isle of alborán located in the mediterranean between spain and north africa is also administered by spain specifically by the municipality of almería andalusia the little pheasant island in the river bidasoa is a spanish-french condominium
largest inhabited islands of spain


 mountains and rivers 

mainland spain is a mountainous country dominated by high plateaus and mountain chains after the pyrenees the main mountain ranges are the cordillera cantábrica cantabrian range sistema ibérico iberian system sistema central central system montes de toledo sierra morena and the sistema bético baetic system whose highest peak the 3,478-metre-high 11,411-foot mulhacén located in sierra nevada is the highest elevation in the iberian peninsula the highest point in spain is the teide a 3,718-metre 12,198 ft active volcano in the canary islands the meseta central often translated as inner plateau is a vast plateau in the heart of peninsular spain
there are several major rivers in spain such as the tagus tajo ebro guadiana douro duero guadalquivir júcar segura turia and minho miño alluvial plains are found along the coast the largest of which is that of the guadalquivir in andalusia


 climate 

three main climatic zones can be separated according to geographical situation and orographic conditions
the mediterranean climate characterised by warmhot and dry summers is dominant in the peninsula it has two varieties csa and csb according to the köppen climate classification
the csa zone is associated to areas with hot summers it is predominant in the mediterranean and southern atlantic coast and inland throughout andalusia extremadura and much if not most of the centre of the country the csa zone covers climatic zones with both relatively warm and cold winters which are considered extremely different to each other at a local level reason for which köppen classification is often eschewed within spain local climatic maps generally divide the mediterranean zone which covers most of the country between warm-winter and cold-winter zones rather than according to summer temperatures
the csb zone has warm rather than hot summers and extends to additional cool-winter areas not typically associated with a mediterranean climate such as much of central and northern-central of spain eg western castile–león northeastern castilla-la mancha and northern madrid and into much rainier areas notably galicia note areas with relatively high rainfall such as galicia are not considered mediterranean under local classifications but classed as oceanic
the semi-arid climate bsk bsh is predominant in the southeastern quarter of the country but is also widespread in other areas of spain it covers most of the region of murcia southern valencia and eastern andalusia where true hot desert climates also exist further to the north it is predominant in the upper and mid reaches of the ebro valley which crosses southern navarre central aragon and western catalonia it also is found in madrid extremadura castilla-la mancha and some locations of western andalusia the dry season extends beyond the summer and average temperature depends on altitude and latitude
the oceanic climate cfb located in the northern quarter of the country especially in the atlantic region basque country cantabria asturias and partly galicia and castile–león additionally it is also found in northern navarre in most highlands areas along the iberian system and in the pyrenean valleys where a humid subtropical variant cfa also occurs winter and summer temperatures are influenced by the ocean and have no seasonal droughtapart from these main types other sub-types can be found like the alpine climate in areas with very high altitude the humid subtropical climate in areas of northeastern spain and the continental climates dfc dfb  dsc dsb in the pyrenees as well as parts of the cantabrian range the central system sierra nevada and the iberian system and a typical desert climate bwk bwh in the zone of almería murcia and eastern canary islands low-lying areas of the canary islands average above 18.0 °c 64.4 °f during their coldest month thus having a tropical climate


 fauna and flora 

the fauna presents a wide diversity that is due in large part to the geographical position of the iberian peninsula between the atlantic and the mediterranean and between africa and eurasia and the great diversity of habitats and biotopes the result of a considerable variety of climates and well differentiated regions
the vegetation of spain is varied due to several factors including the diversity of the relief the climate and latitude spain includes different phytogeographic regions each with its own floristic characteristics resulting largely from the interaction of climate topography soil type and fire biotic factors


 politics 

according to the democracy index of the eiu spain is one of the 19 full democracies in the world
the spanish constitution of 1978 is the culmination of the spanish transition to democracy
the constitutional history of spain dates back to the constitution of 1812 impatient with the slow pace of democratic political reforms in 1976 and 1977 spains new king juan carlos known for his formidable personality dismissed carlos arias navarro and appointed the reformer adolfo suárez as prime minister the resulting general election in 1977 convened the constituent cortes the spanish parliament in its capacity as a constitutional assembly for the purpose of drafting and approving the constitution of 1978 after a national referendum on 6 december 1978 88% of voters approved of the new constitution
as a result spain is now composed of 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities with varying degrees of autonomy thanks to its constitution which nevertheless explicitly states the indivisible unity of the spanish nation the constitution also specifies that spain has no state religion and that all are free to practice and believe as they wish
the spanish administration approved the gender equality act in 2007 aimed at furthering equality between genders in spanish political and economic life according to inter-parliamentary union data as of sept 1 2018 137 of the 350 members of the congress were women 39.1 while in the senate there were 101 women out of 266 39.9 placing spain 16th on their list of countries ranked by proportion of women in the lower or single house the gender empowerment measure of spain in the united nations human development report is 0.794 12th in the world


 government 

spain is a constitutional monarchy with a hereditary monarch and a bicameral parliament the cortes generales general courts the executive branch consists of a council of ministers of spain presided over by the prime minister nominated and appointed by the monarch and confirmed by the congress of deputies following legislative elections by political custom established by king juan carlos since the ratification of the 1978 constitution the kings nominees have all been from parties who maintain a plurality of seats in the congress

 human rights 

the spanish constitution of 1978 protect all spaniards and all the peoples of spain in the exercise of human rights their cultures and traditions languages and institutionsaccording to amnesty international ai government investigations of alleged police abuses are often lengthy and punishments were light violence against women was a problem which the government took steps to addressspain provides one of the highest degrees of liberty in the world for its lgbt community among the countries studied by pew research center in 2013 spain is rated first in acceptance of homosexuality with an 88% of society supporting the gay community compared to 11% who do not


 administrative divisions 

the spanish state is divided into 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities both groups being the highest or first-order administrative division in the country autonomous communities are divided into provinces of which there are 50 in total and in turn provinces are divided into municipalities in catalonia two additional divisions exist the comarques sing comarca and the vegueries sing vegueria both of which have administrative powers comarques being aggregations of municipalities and the vegueries being aggregations of comarques the concept of a comarca exists in all autonomous communities however unlike catalonia these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions


 autonomous communities 

spains autonomous communities are the first level administrative divisions of the country they were created after the current constitution came into effect in 1978 in recognition of the right to self-government of the nationalities and regions of spain the autonomous communities were to comprise adjacent provinces with common historical cultural and economical traits this territorial organisation based on devolution is literally known in spain as the state of autonomies
the basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the statute of autonomy the statutes of autonomy establish the name of the community according to its historical and contemporary identity the limits of its territories the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitutionthe governments of all autonomous communities must be based on a division of powers and comprise

a legislative assembly whose members must be elected by universal suffrage according to the system of proportional representation and in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented
a government council with executive and administrative functions headed by a president elected by the legislative assembly and nominated by the king of spain
a supreme court under the supreme court of spain which heads the judiciary in the autonomous communitycatalonia galicia and the basque country which identified themselves as nationalities were granted self-government through a rapid process andalusia also took that denomination in its first statute of autonomy even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country progressively other communities in revisions to their statutes of autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance to their historical and modern identities such as the valencian community the canary islands the balearic islands and aragonthe autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy with their own parliaments and regional governments the distribution of powers may be different for every community as laid out in their statutes of autonomy since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical only two communities—the basque country and navarre—have full fiscal autonomy aside of fiscal autonomy the nationalities—andalusia the basque country catalonia and galicia—were devolved more powers than the rest of the communities among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time in addition the basque country catalonia and navarre have police corps of their own ertzaintza mossos desquadra and the policía foral respectively other communities have more limited forces or none at all like the policía autónoma andaluza in andalusia or the bescam in madrid
nonetheless recent amendments to existing statutes of autonomy or the promulgation of new statutes altogether have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the nationalities and the rest of the regions
finally along with the 17 autonomous communities two autonomous cities are also part of the state of autonomies and are first-order territorial divisions ceuta and melilla these are two exclaves located in the northern african coast


 provinces and municipalities 

autonomous communities are divided into provinces which served as their territorial building blocks in turn provinces are divided into municipalities the existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution not necessarily by the statutes of autonomy themselves municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the statethe current provincial division structure is based—with minor changes—on the 1833 territorial division by javier de burgos and in all the spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces the communities of asturias cantabria la rioja the balearic islands madrid murcia and navarre are the only communities that comprise a single province which is coextensive with the community itself in these cases the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community


 foreign relations 

after the return of democracy following the death of franco in 1975 spains foreign policy priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the franco years and expand diplomatic relations enter the european community and define security relations with the west
as a member of nato since 1982 spain has established itself as a participant in multilateral international security activities spains eu membership represents an important part of its foreign policy even on many international issues beyond western europe spain prefers to co-ordinate its efforts with its eu partners through the european political co-operation mechanismsspain has maintained its special relations with hispanic america and the philippines its policy emphasizes the concept of an ibero-american community essentially the renewal of the concept of hispanidad or hispanismo as it is often referred to in english which has sought to link the iberian peninsula with hispanic america through language commerce history and culture it is fundamentally based on shared values and the recovery of democracy
territorial disputesspain claims gibraltar a 6-square-kilometre 2.3 sq mi overseas territory of the united kingdom in the southernmost part of the iberian peninsula then a spanish town it was conquered by an anglo-dutch force in 1704 during the war of the spanish succession on behalf of archduke charles pretender to the spanish throne
the legal situation concerning gibraltar was settled in 1713 by the treaty of utrecht in which spain ceded the territory in perpetuity to the british crown stating that should the british abandon this post it would be offered to spain first since the 1940s spain has called for the return of gibraltar the overwhelming majority of gibraltarians strongly oppose this along with any proposal of shared sovereignty un resolutions call on the united kingdom and spain both eu members to reach an agreement over the status of gibraltarthe spanish claim makes a distinction between the isthmus that connects the rock to the spanish mainland on the one hand and the rock and city of gibraltar on the other while the rock and city were ceded by the treaty of utrecht spain asserts that the occupation of the isthmus is illegal and against the principles of international law the united kingdom relies on de facto arguments of possession by prescription in relation to the isthmus as there has been continuous possession of the isthmus over a long periodanother claim by spain is about the savage islands part of portugal in clash with the portuguese position spain claims that they are rocks rather than islands and therefore spain does not accept any extension of the portuguese exclusive economic zone 200 nautical miles generated by the islands while acknowledging the selvagens having territorial waters 12 nautical miles on 5 july 2013 spain sent a letter to the un expressing these viewsspain claims the sovereignty over the perejil island a small uninhabited rocky islet located in the south shore of the strait of gibraltar the island lies 250 metres 820 ft just off the coast of morocco 8 kilometres 5.0 mi from ceuta and 13.5 kilometres 8.4 mi from mainland spain its sovereignty is disputed between spain and morocco it was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002 the incident ended when both countries agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the moroccan occupation of the island the islet is now deserted and without any sign of sovereignty
besides the perejil island the spanish-held territories claimed by other countries are two morocco claims the spanish cities of ceuta and melilla and the plazas de soberanía islets off the northern coast of africa portugal does not recognise spains sovereignty over the territory of olivenza which was annexed by spain in 1801 after the war of the oranges portugal stance has been the territory being de iure portuguese territory and de facto spanish


 military 

the armed forces of spain are known as the spanish armed forces fuerzas armadas españolas their commander-in-chief is the king of spain felipe vithe spanish armed forces are divided into three branches
army ejército de tierra
navy armada
air force ejército del aire


 ecology 

since 1996 co2 emissions have risen notably not reaching the reduction emissions promised in the kyoto protocol for fighting climate change in the period 1880–2000 more than half of the years have been qualified as dry or very dry spain is the country in europe more exposed to climate change effects according to al gore
electricity from renewable sources in spain represented 42.8% of electricity demand coverage during 2014 the country has a very large wind power capability built up over many years and is one of the world leaders in wind power generation spain also positioned itself as a european leader in solar power by 2007–2010 the country was second only to germany in installed capacity
vitoria-gasteiz was awarded with the european green capital in 2012 after implementining good practices by the agenda 21 and recovering salburua wetland protected by ramsar convention and natura 2000 and a part of green belt of vitoria-gasteiz funded partially with the life programme


 economy 

spains capitalist mixed economy is the 14th largest worldwide and the 5th largest in the european union as well as the eurozones 4th largest
the centre-right government of former prime minister josé maría aznar worked successfully to gain admission to the group of countries launching the euro in 1999 unemployment stood at 17.1% in june 2017 below spains early 1990s unemployment rate of at over 20 the youth unemployment rate 35% in march 2018 is extremely high compared to eu standards perennial weak points of spains economy include a large informal economy and an education system which oecd reports place among the poorest for developed countries together with the united states and uk

by the mid-1990s the economy had recommenced the growth that had been disrupted by the global recession of the early 1990s the strong economic growth helped the government to reduce the government debt as a percentage of gdp and spains high unemployment rate began to steadily decline with the government budget in balance and inflation under control spain was admitted into the eurozone in 1999
since the 1990s some spanish companies have gained multinational status often expanding their activities in culturally close latin america spain is the second biggest foreign investor there after the united states spanish companies have also expanded into asia especially china and india this early global expansion is a competitive advantage over its competitors and european neighbours the reason for this early expansion is the booming interest towards spanish language and culture in asia and africa and a corporate culture that learned to take risks in unstable markets

spanish companies invested in fields like renewable energy commercialisation iberdrola was the worlds largest renewable energy operator technology companies like telefónica abengoa mondragon corporation which is the worlds largest worker-owned cooperative movistar hisdesat indra train manufacturers like caf talgo global corporations such as the textile company inditex petroleum companies like repsol or cepsa and infrastructure with six of the ten biggest international construction firms specialising in transport being spanish like ferrovial acciona acs ohl and fccin 2005 the economist intelligence units quality of life survey placed spain among the top 10 in the world in 2013 the same survey now called the where-to-be-born index ranked spain 28th in the worldin 2010 the basque city of bilbao was awarded with the lee kuan yew world city prize and its mayor at the time iñaki azkuna was awarded the world mayor prize in 2012 the basque capital city of vitoria-gasteiz received the european green capital award in 2012

 agriculture 

crop areas were farmed in two highly diverse manners areas relying on non-irrigated cultivation secano which made up 85% of the entire crop area depended solely on rainfall as a source of water they included the humid regions of the north and the northwest as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated the much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation regadío accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986 and the government hoped that this area would eventually double as it already had doubled since 1950 particularly noteworthy was the development in almería—one of the most arid and desolate provinces of spain—of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to europe

though only about 17% of spains cultivated land was irrigated it was estimated to be the source of between 40–45% of the gross value of crop production and of 50% of the value of agricultural exports more than half of the irrigated area was planted in corn fruit trees and vegetables other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes cotton sugar beets potatoes legumes olive trees mangos strawberries tomatoes and fodder grasses depending on the nature of the crop it was possible to harvest two successive crops in the same year on about 10% of the countrys irrigated land
citrus fruits vegetables cereal grains olive oil and wine—spains traditional agricultural products—continued to be important in the 1980s in 1983 they represented 12 12 8 6 and 4 respectively of the countrys agricultural production because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock poultry and dairy products meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983 increased attention to livestock was the reason that spain became a net importer of grains ideal growing conditions combined with proximity to important north european markets made citrus fruits spains leading export fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities as did sunflower seed oil that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the mediterranean countries of the european community


 tourism

 energy 

spain is one of the worlds leading countries in the development and production of renewable energy in 2010 spain became the solar power world leader when it overtook the united states with a massive power station plant called la florida near alvarado badajoz spain is also europes main producer of wind energy in 2010 its wind turbines generated 42,976 gwh which accounted for 16.4% of all electrical energy produced in spain on 9 november 2010 wind energy reached an instantaneous historic peak covering 53% of mainland electricity demand and generating an amount of energy that is equivalent to that of 14 nuclear reactors other renewable energies used in spain are hydroelectric biomass and marine 2 power plants under constructionnon-renewable energy sources used in spain are nuclear 8 operative reactors gas coal and oil fossil fuels together generated 58% of spains electricity in 2009 just below the oecd mean of 61 nuclear power generated another 19 and wind and hydro about 12% each

in 2008 the population of spain officially reached 46 million people as recorded by the padrón municipal spains municipal register spains population density at 91km² 235sq mi is lower than that of most western european countries and its distribution across the country is very unequal with the exception of the region surrounding the capital madrid the most populated areas lie around the coast the population of spain has risen  2 1/2 times  since 1900 when it stood at 18.6 million principally due to the spectacular demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970snative spaniards make up 88% of the total population of spain after the birth rate plunged in the 1980s and spains population growth rate dropped the population again trended upward initially upon the return of many spaniards who had emigrated to other european countries during the 1970s and more recently fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12% of the population the immigrants originate mainly in latin america 39 north africa 16 eastern europe 15 and sub-saharan africa 4 in 2005 spain instituted a three-month amnesty programme through which certain hitherto undocumented aliens were granted legal residencyin 2008 spain granted citizenship to 84,170 persons mostly to people from ecuador colombia and morocco a sizeable portion of foreign residents in spain also comes from other western and central european countries these are mostly british french german dutch and norwegian they reside primarily on the mediterranean coast and the balearic islands where many choose to live their retirement or telecommute
substantial populations descended from spanish colonists and immigrants exist in other parts of the world most notably in latin america beginning in the late 15th century large numbers of iberian colonists settled in what became latin america and at present most white latin americans who make up about one-third of latin americas population are of spanish or portuguese origin around 240,000 spaniards emigrated in the 16th century mostly to peru and mexico another 450,000 left in the 17th century the estimate between 1492–1832 is 1.86 million between 1846 and 1932 it is estimated that nearly 5 million spaniards emigrated to the americas especially to argentina and brazil approximately two million spaniards migrated to other western european countries between 1960 and 1975 during the same period perhaps 300,000 went to latin america

 peoples 

the spanish constitution of 1978 in its second article recognises several contemporary entities—nationalities— and regions within the context of the spanish nation
spain is de facto a plurinational state the identity of spain rather accrues of an overlap of different territorial and ethnolinguistic identities than of a sole spanish identity in some cases some of the territorial identities may conflict with the dominant spanish culture distinct traditional identities within spain include the basques catalans galicians andalusians and valencians although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities may claim a distinct local identity
it is this last feature of shared identity between the more local level or autonomous community and the spanish level which makes the identity question in spain complex and far from univocal


 minority groups 

spain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies especially latin america and north africa smaller numbers of immigrants from several sub-saharan countries have recently been settling in spain there are also sizeable numbers of asian immigrants most of whom are of middle eastern south asian and chinese origin the single largest group of immigrants are european represented by large numbers of romanians britons germans french and othersthe arrival of the gitanos a romani people began in the 16th century estimates of the spanish roma population range from 750,000 to over one million there are also the mercheros also quinquis a formerly nomadic minority group their origin is unclear
historically sephardi jews and moriscos are the main minority groups originated in spain and with a contribution to spanish culture the spanish government is offering spanish nationality to sephardi jews


 immigration 

according to the spanish government there were 5.7 million foreign residents in spain in 2011 or 12% of the total population according to residence permit data for 2011 more than 860,000 were romanian about 770,000 were moroccan approximately 390,000 were british and 360,000 were ecuadorian other sizeable foreign communities are colombian bolivian german italian bulgarian and chinese there are more than 200,000 migrants from sub-saharan africa living in spain principally senegaleses and nigerians since 2000 spain has experienced high population growth as a result of immigration flows despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level this sudden and ongoing inflow of immigrants particularly those arriving illegally by sea has caused noticeable social tensionwithin the eu spain had the 2nd highest immigration rate in percentage terms after cyprus but by a great margin the highest in absolute numbers up to 2008 the number of immigrants in spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2 million in 2008 out of a total population of 46 million in 2005 alone a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people there are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration including spains cultural ties with latin america its geographical position the porosity of its borders the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce
another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of eu origin typically retiring to spains mediterranean coast in fact spain was europes largest absorber of migrants from 2002 to 2007 with its immigrant population more than doubling as 2.5 million people arrived in 2008 prior to the onset of the economic crisis the financial times reported that spain was the most favoured destination for western europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the euin 2008 the government instituted a plan of voluntary return which encouraged unemployed immigrants from outside the eu to return to their home countries and receive several incentives including the right to keep their unemployment benefits and transfer whatever they contributed to the spanish social security the programme had little effect during its first two months just 1,400 immigrants took up the offer what the programme failed to do the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs in 2011 alone more than half a million people left spain for the first time in decades the net migration rate was expected to be negative and nine out of 10 emigrants were foreigners


 languages 

spain is legally multilingual and the constitution establishes that the nation will protect all spaniards and the peoples of spain in the exercise of human rights their cultures and traditions languages and institutionsspanish español— recognised in the constitution as castilian castellano—is the official language of the entire country and it is the right and duty of every spaniard to know the language the constitution also establishes that the other spanish languages—that is the other languages of spain—will also be official in their respective autonomous communities in accordance to their statutes their organic regional legislations and that the richness of the distinct linguistic modalities of spain represents a patrimony which will be the object of special respect and protectionthe other official languages of spain co-official with spanish are

catalan català or valencià in catalonia the valencian community and the balearic islands
galician galego in galicia
basque euskara in the basque country and navarre and
occitan aranés in cataloniaas a percentage of the general population of all spain spanish is natively spoken by 74 catalan by 17 galician by 7% and basque by 2% of all spaniards occitan is spoken by less than 5,000 people only in the small region of val daran

other romance minority languages though not official have special recognition such as the astur-leonese language asturianu bable or llionés and aragonese aragonés in aragon
in the north african spanish autonomous city of melilla riff berber is spoken by a significant part of the population similarly in ceuta darija arabic is spoken by a significant percentage of the population in the tourist areas of the mediterranean coast and the islands english and german are widely spoken by tourists foreign residents and tourism workers


 education 

state education in spain is free and compulsory from the age of six to sixteen the current education system is regulated by the 2006 educational law loe ley orgánica de educación or fundamental law for the education in 2014 the loe was partially modified by the newer and controversial lomce law ley orgánica para la mejora de la calidad educativa or fundamental law for the improvement of the education system commonly called ley wert wert law since 1970 to 2014 spain has had seven different educational laws lge loece lode logse lopeg loe and lomceinstitución libre de enseñanza was an educational project that developed in spain for the half a century of about 1876–1936 by francisco giner de los ríos and gumersindo de azcárate the institute was inspired by the philosophy of krausism concepción arenal in feminism and santiago ramón y cajal in neuroscience were in the movement


 health 

the health care system of spain spanish national health system is considered one of the best in the world in 7th position in the ranking elaborated by the world health organization the health care is public universal and free for any legal citizen of spain the total health spending is 9.4% of the gdp slightly above the average of 9.3% of the oecd


 religion 

roman catholicism which has a long history in spain remains the dominant religion although it no longer has official status by law in all public schools in spain students have to choose either a religion or ethics class catholicism is the religion most commonly taught although the teaching of islam judaism and evangelical christianity is also recognised in law according to a june 2016 study by the spanish centre for sociological research about 70% of spaniards self-identify as catholics 2% other faith and about 25% identify with no religion most spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services this same study shows that of the spaniards who identify themselves as religious 59% hardly ever or never go to church 16% go to church some times a year 9% some time per month and 15% every sunday or multiple times per week recent polls and surveys have revealed that atheists and agnostics constitute anywhere from 20% to 27% of the spanish population

altogether about 9% of the entire spanish population attends religious services at least once per month though spanish society has become considerably more secular in recent decades the influx of latin american immigrants who tend to be strong catholic practitioners has helped the catholic church to recover the spanish constitution enshrines secularism in governance as well as freedom of religion or belief for all saying that no religion should have a state character while allowing for the state to cooperate with religious groups however significant anomalies remain including the presence of a blasphemy law in statute which theoretically criminalises criticism of religion a blasphemy prosecution in spain has happened as recently as 2012
there have been four spanish popes damasus i calixtus iii alexander vi and benedict xiii spanish mysticism provided an important intellectual resource against protestantism with carmelites like teresa of ávila a reformist nun and john of the cross a priest taking the lead in their reform movement later they became doctors of the church the society of jesus was co-founded by ignatius of loyola  whose spiritual exercises and movement led to the establishment of hundreds of colleges and universities in the world including 28 in the united states alone the societys co-founder francis xavier was a missionary who reached india and later japan  in the 1960s jesuits pedro arrupe and ignacio ellacuría supported the movement of liberation theology
protestant churches have about 1,200,000 members there are about 105,000 jehovahs witnesses the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints has approximately 46,000 adherents in 133 congregations in all regions of the country and has a temple in the moratalaz district of madrid

a study made by the union of islamic communities of spain demonstrated that there were about 1,700,000 inhabitants of muslim background living in spain as of  2012 accounting for 3–4% of the total population of spain the vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from morocco and other african countries more than 514,000 30 of them had spanish nationalitythe recent waves of immigration have also led to an increasing number of hindus buddhists sikhs and muslims
after the reconquista in 1492 muslims did not live in spain for centuries late 19th-century colonial expansion in northwestern africa gave a number of residents in spanish morocco and western sahara full citizenship their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration especially from morocco and algeria
judaism was practically non-existent in spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century when jews were again permitted to enter the country currently there are around 62,000 jews in spain or 0.14% of the total population most are arrivals in the past century while some are descendants of earlier spanish jews approximately 80,000 jews are thought to have lived in spain prior to its expulsion however the jewish encyclopedia states the number over 800,000 to be too large and 235,000 as too small 165,000 is given as expelled as possibly too small in favour or 200,000 and the numbers of converts after the 1391 pogroms as less other sources suggest 200,000 converts mostly after the pogroms of 1391 and upwards of 100,000 expelled
the descendants of these sephardic jews expelled in 1492 are given the spanish nationality if they request so


 culture 

spain is a western country almost every aspect of spanish life is permeated by its roman heritage making spain one of the major latin countries of europe spanish culture is marked by strong historic ties to catholicism which played a pivotal role in the countrys formation and subsequent identity spanish art architecture cuisine and music has been shaped by successive waves of foreign invaders as well as by the countrys mediterranean climate and geography the centuries-long colonial era globalised spanish language and culture with spain also absorbing the cultural and commercial products of its diverse empire


 world heritage sites 

after italy 54 and china 52 spain is the third country in the world with the most world heritage sites at the present time it has 47 recognised sites including the landscape of monte perdido in the pyrenees which is shared with france the prehistoric rock art sites of the côa valley and siega verde which is shared with portugal the portuguese part being in the côa valley guarda the heritage of mercury shared with slovenia and the ancient and primeval beech forests shared with other countries of europe in addition spain has also 14 intangible cultural heritage or human treasures spain ranks first in europe according to unescos intangible cultural heritage list tied with croatia


 literature 

the earliest recorded examples of vernacular romance-based literature date from the same time and location the rich mix of muslim jewish and christian cultures in muslim spain in which maimonides averroes and others worked the kharjas jarchas

during the reconquista the epic poem cantar de mio cid was written about a real man—his battles conquests and daily life it is also remarkable the valencian chivalric romance tirant lo blanch written in valencian
other major plays from the medieval times were mester de juglaría mester de clerecía coplas por la muerte de su padre or el libro de buen amor the book of good love
during the renaissance the major plays are la celestina and el lazarillo de tormes while many religious literature was created with poets as luis de león san juan de la cruz santa teresa de jesús etc
the baroque is the most important period for spanish culture we are in the times of the spanish empire the famous don quijote de la mancha by miguel de cervantes was written in this time other writers from the period are francisco de quevedo lope de vega calderón de la barca or tirso de molina
during the enlightenment we find names such as leandro fernández de moratín benito jerónimo feijóo gaspar melchor de jovellanos or leandro fernández de moratín

during the romanticism josé zorrilla created one of the most emblematic figures in european literature in don juan tenorio other writers from this period are gustavo adolfo bécquer josé de espronceda rosalía de castro or mariano josé de larra
in realism we find names such as benito pérez galdós emilia pardo bazán leopoldo alas clarín concepción arenal vicente blasco ibáñez and menéndez pelayo realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society as they were in the spirit of general realism realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences instead of romanticised or stylised presentations
the group that has become known as the generation of 1898 was marked by the destruction of spains fleet in cuba by us gunboats in 1898 which provoked a cultural crisis in spain the disaster of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political economic and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of regeneracionismo for a group of younger writers among them miguel de unamuno pío baroja and josé martínez ruiz azorín the disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper more radical literary shift that affected both form and content these writers along with ramón del valle-inclán antonio machado ramiro de maeztu and ángel ganivet came to be known as the generation of 98

the generation of 1914 or novecentismo the next supposed generation of spanish writers following those of 98 already calls into question the value of such terminology by the year 1914—the year of the outbreak of the first world war and of the publication of the first major work of the generations leading voice josé ortega y gasset—a number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the spanish cultural field
leading voices include the poet juan ramón jiménez the academics and essayists ramón menéndez pidal gregorio marañón manuel azaña maria zambrano eugeni dors clara campoamor and ortega y gasset and the novelists gabriel miró ramón pérez de ayala and ramón gómez de la serna while still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of 98 they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity salvador de madariaga another prominent intellectual and writer was one of the founders of the college of europe and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the liberal international
the generation of 1927 where poets pedro salinas jorge guillén federico garcía lorca vicente aleixandre dámaso alonso all were scholars of their national literary heritage again evidence of the impact of the calls of regeneracionistas and the generation of 1898 for spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards

the two main writers in the second half of the 20th century were the nobel prize in literature laureate camilo josé cela and miguel delibes from generation of 36 spain is one of the countries with the most number of laureates with the nobel prize in literature and with latin american laureates they made the spanish language literature one of the most laureates of all the spanish writers are josé echegaray jacinto benavente juan ramón jiménez vicente aleixandre and camilo josé cela the portuguese writer josé saramago also awarded with the prize lived for many years in spain and spoke both portuguese and spanish saramago was also well known by his iberist ideas

 architecture 

due to its historical and geographical diversity spanish architecture has drawn from a host of influences an important provincial city founded by the romans and with an extensive roman era infrastructure córdoba became the cultural capital including fine arabic style architecture during the time of the islamic umayyad dynasty later arab style architecture continued to be developed under successive islamic dynasties ending with the nasrid which built its famed palace complex in granada
simultaneously the christian kingdoms gradually emerged and developed their own styles developing a pre-romanesque style when for a while isolated from contemporary mainstream european architectural influences during the earlier middle ages they later integrated the romanesque and gothic streams there was then an extraordinary flowering of the gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory the mudéjar style from the 12th to 17th centuries was developed by introducing arab style motifs patterns and elements into european architecture
the arrival of modernism in the academic arena produced much of the architecture of the 20th century an influential style centred in barcelona known as modernisme produced a number of important architects of which gaudí is one the international style was led by groups like gatepac spain is currently experiencing a revolution in contemporary architecture and spanish architects like rafael moneo santiago calatrava ricardo bofill as well as many others have gained worldwide renown

 cuisine 

spanish cuisine consists of a great variety of dishes which stem from differences in geography culture and climate it is heavily influenced by seafood available from the waters that surround the country and reflects the countrys deep mediterranean roots spains extensive history with many cultural influences has led to a unique cuisine in particular three main divisions are easily identified
mediterranean spain – all such coastal regions from catalonia to andalusia – heavy use of seafood such as pescaíto frito fried fish several cold soups like gazpacho and many rice-based dishes like paella from valencia and arròs negre black rice from cataloniainner spain – castile – hot thick soups such as the bread and garlic-based castilian soup along with substantious stews such as cocido madrileño food is traditionally conserved by salting like spanish ham or immersed in olive oil like manchego cheese
