the french space program includes both civil and military spaceflight activities it is the 3rd oldest institutional space program in history along with the ussr and the us and the largest space program in europe


 background 

space travel has long been a significant ambition in french culture from the gobelins 1664 tapestry representing a space rocket to jules vernes 1865 novel de la terre à la lune and george méliès 1902 movie voyage dans la lune space and rocketry were present in french society long before the technological means appeared to allow the development of a space exploration program
during the late 18th century jean-françois pilâtre de rozier jacques charles and the montgolfier brothers are seen as worldwide precursors and explorers of aeronautics with the world record altitude then reached by a human at 7,016 metres 23,018 ft performed by joseph-louis gay-lussac in 1804 those names their numerous students and their works will mark the early expertise of frances space program in all types of air balloons since

in the beginning of the twentieth century the origins of the french space program are tied to french technological developments in aerospace and astronautics notably the nascent airplane and rocket industries

robert esnault-pelterie appears as one of the early pioneers in space exploration design and rocket science from 1908 he studied propulsion and space flight without knowing the work of russian mathematician konstantin tsiolkovsky at that time he derived the mathematical equations for interplanetary flight flight durations and engine propulsion and was later nominated president of the chambre syndicale des industries aéronautiques trade association of aircraft industries in 1912 from 1935 to 1939 he designed a high-altitude sounding rocket but world war ii interrupted his plans german experts believed that the rocket could have reached its design goal of 60 miles 97 km esnault-pelterie convinced physicist jean-jacques barré a pioneer in rocket propulsion to collaborate on the design of a self-propelled cryogenic rocket
between 1927 and 1933 barré did extensive research and developed a rocket that could reach the upper atmosphere and space the ea-41 eole see picture


 history 
the beginning of the institutional french space program dates back to 1946 when right after world war ii the laboratoire de recherches balistiques et aérodynamiques lrba was created in vernon to develop the next generation of rockets partly taking advantage of the german development of the v2 rocket
before this and during the war as free france continued to function the ea-41 was tested and improved by military personnel from october 1942 through to 1945.22 may 1952 véronique n1 is successfully launched from the saharan desertin 1958 president charles de gaulle directed the creation of several space research committees in 1959 the comité détudes spatiales was born under the supervision of pierre auger
in 1961 de gaulle signed the creation of the centre national d etudes spatiales cnes to coordinate french space activities development of western europes first carrier rocket the diamant began in 1962 first launched in algeria
november 26 1965 at 15h 47mn and 21s asterix the first french satellite in space is successfully launched by a diamant rocket from the algerian desert it is active for 2 consecutive days before ceasing to transmitin 1965 frances space launch pads and cnes settled in kourou
in 1973 france impulsed the creation of the european space agency and became its first contributor
the french space budget although stagnant since the early 2000s in constant euros remains in absolute terms the largest of the member countries of the european space agency esa and the second largest national budget after the united states of america at 2,33 billion € in 2004 this budget stood at 1.698 billion euros with 685 million being transferred to the paris-based esa for the programs conducted under its supervision

the ariane rocket family is frances own launcher family which use has been extended to the whole of esas member countries
its spaceport near kourou was selected in 1964 to host all of frances launches later it was selected as esas launch site before being in french guiana frances space launches were made from algeria in colomb-béchar and hammaguirthe french space program thus benefits from the best ground position for launch sites on earth as its position 5.3° north of the equator allows rockets to gain propulsion from the spinning of the earth when launched eastward 460 ms and save on propellant no other governmental launch sites allow this level of physical parameters it is also able to launch satellites into polar orbits from this spaceport


 launch statistics 
as of  2017 kourou counts amongst the spaceports with the highest percentage of successful launches both successive and overall here is a chronology of all orbital launches from the kourou spaceport since 1970 under the french and european space programmes

 collaborations 

frances public involvement in space technologies is also deep into european programs such as columbus and automated transfer vehicle through thales alenia headquartered in cannes
the french space program includes collaborations between its institutions and other countries european as well as other foreign countries and institutions jaxa isro nasa cnsa in projects ranging from the herschel space observatory to bepicolombo saralaltika and the planck space observatoryin 2016 for the cop21 cnes and isro impulsed a groundbreaking and worldwide plan to unite all space agencies for the gathering of satellite information and detection on greenhouse gas emissions allowing more precise measurements and decision makingin addition cnes and esa have a strong background of collaboration notably building the largest single satellite surveyance program for earths biological monitoring copernicus programme


 future projects and international collaborations 
the construction of the ariane 6 launcher is underway after being approved by all esa countries in 2016  it is designed by airbus safran launcherssince 2010 france and russia have been collaborating on several space missions including long-run science programmes like cardiomed dedicated to monitoring cardiovascular health in cosmonautscnes has provided essential instruments cameras on an indian mission to the moon launched in january 2018
a consortium led by the cnes also built argos instruments on board the indian mission oceansat 3 in 2018 
a third collaboration between the isro and french space actors laboratoire d’études spatiales et d’instrumentation en astrophysique lesia cnrs université paris-vi and université paris-vii has seen the launch of picsat in january 2018 a nano-satellite that surveys the beta pictoris star for exoplanets
in 2018 cnes and jaxa will launch the bepicolombo mission to study the magnetic field of mercury and map its surface
in 2018 solar orbiter will be launched by nasa containing instruments designed by cnes and other french industrial actorsstarting in 2018 the cfosat china-france oceanography satellite will be placed into earth orbit to study ocean surface winds and waves
after president macrons state visit to china in january 2018 the french-chinese collaboration in space was increased significantly and includes more in-depth collaboration notably in the sharing of cfosat data meant to study oceans and their interaction with the atmosphere as well as in the svom programthe french mission taranis with international laboratories collaboration will be also launched in 2018 it is the 1st satellite designed to observe lightning at altitudes of 20 to 100 kmthe french space agency was also responsible for the construction of the main instruments on the french-german-american insight mission to mars scheduled for launch on the 5th may 2018 and due for arrival in november 2018
in 2021 france and germany will launch their collaborative mission merlin due to study methane levels and concentrations in the earths atmosphere2022 will mark the launch of juice jupiter icy moons explorer it will study jupiter and three of its moons with a view to gaining new insights into how life emerged this mission is a collaboration of cnes with cnrs and esa
