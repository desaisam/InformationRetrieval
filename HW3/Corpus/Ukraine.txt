 etymology 

there are different hypotheses as to the etymology of the name ukraine according to the older widespread hypothesis it means borderland while some more recent linguistic studies claim a different meaning homeland or region countrythe ukraine used to be the usual form in english but since the declaration of independence of ukraine the ukraine has become less common in the english-speaking world and style-guides largely recommend not using the definite article the ukraine now implies disregard for the countrys sovereignty according to us ambassador william taylor the ukrainian position is that the usage of the ukraine is incorrect both grammatically and politically


 history 


 early history 

neanderthal settlement in ukraine is seen in the molodova archaeological sites 43,000–45,000 bc which include a mammoth bone dwelling the territory is also considered to be the likely location for the human domestication of the horsemodern human settlement in ukraine and its vicinity dates back to 32,000 bc with evidence of the gravettian culture in the crimean mountains by 4,500 bc the neolithic cucuteni–trypillia culture flourished in wide areas of modern ukraine including trypillia and the entire dnieper-dniester region during the iron age the land was inhabited by cimmerians scythians and sarmatians between 700 bc and 200 bc it was part of the scythian kingdom or scythiabeginning in the sixth century bc colonies of ancient greece ancient rome and the byzantine empire such as tyras olbia and chersonesus were founded on the northeastern shore of the black sea these colonies thrived well into the 6th century ad the goths stayed in the area but came under the sway of the huns from the 370s ad in the 7th century ad the territory of eastern ukraine was the centre of old great bulgaria at the end of the century the majority of bulgar tribes migrated in different directions and the khazars took over much of the land


 antes people 

in the 5th and 6th centuries the antes were located in the territory of what is now ukraine the antes were the ancestors of ukrainians white croats severians polans drevlyans dulebes ulichians and tiverians migrations from ukraine throughout the balkans established many southern slavic nations northern migrations reaching almost to the ilmen lakes led to the emergence of the ilmen slavs krivichs and radimichs the groups ancestral to the russians after an avar raid in 602 and the collapse of the antes union most of these peoples survived as separate tribes until the beginning of the second millennium


 golden age of kiev 

kievan rus was founded by the rus people who came from scandinavia across ladoga and settled in kiev around 880 ad kievan rus included the central western and northern part of modern ukraine belarus far eastern strip of poland and the western part of present-day russia according to the primary chronicle the rus elite initially consisted of varangians from scandinaviaduring the 10th and 11th centuries it became the largest and most powerful state in europe it laid the foundation for the national identity of ukrainians and russians kiev the capital of modern ukraine became the most important city of the rus

the varangians later assimilated into the slavic population and became part of the first rus dynasty the rurik dynasty kievan rus was composed of several principalities ruled by the interrelated rurikid knyazes princes who often fought each other for possession of kievthe golden age of kievan rus began with the reign of vladimir the great 980–1015 who turned rus toward byzantine christianity during the reign of his son yaroslav the wise 1019–1054 kievan rus reached the zenith of its cultural development and military power the state soon fragmented as the relative importance of regional powers rose again after a final resurgence under the rule of vladimir ii monomakh 1113–1125 and his son mstislav 1125–1132 kievan rus finally disintegrated into separate principalities following mstislavs deaththe 13th-century mongol invasion devastated kievan rus kiev was totally destroyed in 1240 on todays ukrainian territory the principalities of halych and volodymyr-volynskyi arose and were merged into the state of galicia-volhyniadanylo romanovych daniel i of galicia or danylo halytskyi son of roman mstyslavych re-united all of south-western rus including volhynia galicia and rus ancient capital of kiev danylo was crowned by the papal archbishop in dorohychyn 1253 as the first king of all rus under danylos reign the kingdom of galicia–volhynia was one of the most powerful states in east central europe


 foreign domination 

in the mid-14th century upon the death of bolesław jerzy ii of mazovia king casimir iii of poland initiated campaigns 1340–1366 to take galicia-volhynia meanwhile the heartland of rus including kiev became the territory of the grand duchy of lithuania ruled by gediminas and his successors after the battle on the irpen river following the 1386 union of krewo a dynastic union between poland and lithuania much of what became northern ukraine was ruled by the increasingly slavicised local lithuanian nobles as part of the grand duchy of lithuania by 1392 the so-called galicia–volhynia wars ended polish colonisers of depopulated lands in northern and central ukraine founded or re-founded many towns in 1430 podolia was incorporated under the crown of the kingdom of poland as podolian voivodeship in 1441 in the southern ukraine especially crimea and surrounding steppes genghisid prince haci i giray founded the crimean khanate

in 1569 the union of lublin established the polish–lithuanian commonwealth and much ukrainian territory was transferred from lithuania to the crown of the kingdom of poland becoming polish territory de jure under the demographic cultural and political pressure of polonisation which began in the late 14th century many landed gentry of polish ruthenia another name for the land of rus converted to catholicism and became indistinguishable from the polish nobility deprived of native protectors among rus nobility the commoners peasants and townspeople began turning for protection to the emerging zaporozhian cossacks who by the 17th century became devoutly orthodox the cossacks did not shy from taking up arms against those they perceived as enemies including the polish state and its local representativesformed from golden horde territory conquered after the mongol invasion the crimean khanate was one of the strongest powers in eastern europe until the 18th century in 1571 it even captured and devastated moscow the borderlands suffered annual tatar invasions from the beginning of the 16th century until the end of the 17th century crimean tatar slave raiding bands exported about two million slaves from russia and ukraine according to orest subtelny from 1450 to 1586 eighty-six tatar raids were recorded and from 1600 to 1647 seventy in 1688 tatars captured a record number of 60,000 ukrainians the tatar raids took a heavy toll discouraging settlement in more southerly regions where the soil was better and the growing season was longer the last remnant of the crimean khanate was finally conquered by the russian empire in 1783 the taurida governorate was formed to govern this territory

in the mid-17th century a cossack military quasi-state the zaporozhian host was formed by dnieper cossacks and by ruthenian peasants who had fled polish serfdom poland exercised little real control over this population but found the cossacks to be a useful opposing force to the turks and tatars and at times the two were allies in military campaigns however the continued harsh enserfment of peasantry by polish nobility and especially the suppression of the orthodox church alienated the cossacksthe cossacks sought representation in the polish sejm recognition of orthodox traditions and the gradual expansion of the cossack registry these were rejected by the polish nobility who dominated the sejm


 cossack hetmanate 

in 1648 bohdan khmelnytsky and petro doroshenko led the largest of the cossack uprisings against the commonwealth and the polish king john ii casimir after khmelnytsky made an entry into kiev in 1648 where he was hailed liberator of the people from polish captivity he founded the cossack hetmanate which existed until 1764 some sources claim until 1782
khmelnytsky deserted by his tatar allies suffered a crushing defeat at berestechko in 1651 and turned to the russian tsar for help in 1654 khmelnytsky signed the treaty of pereyaslav forming a military and political alliance with russia that acknowledged loyalty to the russian tsar
in 1657–1686 came the ruin a devastating 30-year war amongst russia poland turks and cossacks for control of ukraine which occurred at about the same time as the deluge of poland the wars escalated in intensity with hundreds of thousands of deaths defeat came in 1686 as the eternal peace between russia and poland divided the ukrainian lands between them
in 1709 cossack hetman ivan mazepa 1639–1709 defected to sweden against russia in the great northern war 1700–1721 eventually peter recognized that to consolidate and modernize russias political and economic power it was necessary to do away with the hetmanate and ukrainian and cossack aspirations to autonomy mazepa died in exile after fleeing from the battle of poltava 1709 where the swedes and their cossack allies suffered a catastrophic defeat

the constitution of pylyp orlyk or pacts and constitutions of rights and freedoms of the zaporizhian host was a 1710 constitutional document written by hetman pylyp orlyk a cossack of ukraine then within the polish–lithuanian commonwealth it established a standard for the separation of powers in government between the legislative executive and judiciary branches well before the publication of montesquieus spirit of the laws the constitution limited the executive authority of the hetman and established a democratically elected cossack parliament called the general council pylyp orlyks constitution was unique for its historic period and was one of the first state constitutions in europethe hetmanate was abolished in 1764 the zaporizhska sich abolished in 1775 as russia centralised control over its lands as part of the partitioning of poland in 1772 1793 and 1795 the ukrainian lands west of the dnieper were divided between russia and austria from 1737 to 1834 expansion into the northern black sea littoral and the eastern danube valley was a cornerstone of russian foreign policy

lithuanians and poles controlled vast estates in ukraine and were a law unto themselves judicial rulings from cracow were routinely flouted while peasants were heavily taxed and practically tied to the land as serfs occasionally the landowners battled each other using armies of ukrainian peasants the poles and lithuanians were roman catholics and tried with some success to convert the orthodox lesser nobility in 1596 they set up the greek-catholic or uniate church it dominates western ukraine to this day religious differentiation left the ukrainian orthodox peasants leaderless as they were reluctant to follow the ukrainian noblescossacks led an uprising called koliivshchyna starting in the ukrainian borderlands of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth in 1768 ethnicity was one root cause of this revolt which included ukrainian violence that killed tens of thousands of poles and jews religious warfare also broke out among ukrainian groups increasing conflict between uniate and orthodox parishes along the newly reinforced polish-russian border on the dnieper river in the time of catherine ii set the stage for the uprising as uniate religious practices had become more latinized orthodoxy in this region drew even closer into dependence on the russian orthodox church confessional tensions also reflected opposing polish and russian political allegiancesafter the annexation of crimea by the russian empire in 1783 new russia was settled by ukrainians and russians despite promises in the treaty of pereyaslav the ukrainian elite and the cossacks never received the freedoms and the autonomy they were expecting however within the empire ukrainians rose to the highest russian state and church offices at a later period tsarists established a policy of russification suppressing the use of the ukrainian language in print and in public


 19th century world war i and revolution 

in the 19th century ukraine was a rural area largely ignored by russia and austria with growing urbanization and modernization and a cultural trend toward romantic nationalism a ukrainian intelligentsia committed to national rebirth and social justice emerged the serf-turned-national-poet taras shevchenko 1814–1861 and the political theorist mykhailo drahomanov 1841–1895 led the growing nationalist movementafter the russo-turkish war 1768–1774 catherine the great and her immediate successors encouraged german immigration into ukraine and especially into crimea to thin the previously dominant turk population and encourage agriculturebeginning in the 19th century there was migration from ukraine to distant areas of the russian empire according to the 1897 census there were 223,000 ethnic ukrainians in siberia and 102,000 in central asia an additional 1.6 million emigrated to the east in the ten years after the opening of the trans-siberian railway in 1906 far eastern areas with an ethnic ukrainian population became known as green ukrainenationalist and socialist parties developed in the late 19th century austrian galicia under the relatively lenient rule of the habsburgs became the centre of the nationalist movementukrainians entered world war i on the side of both the central powers under austria and the triple entente under russia 3.5 million ukrainians fought with the imperial russian army while 250,000 fought for the austro-hungarian army austro-hungarian authorities established the ukrainian legion to fight against the russian empire this became the ukrainian galician army that fought against the bolsheviks and poles in the post-world war i period 1919–23 those suspected of russophile sentiments in austria were treated harshly

world war i destroyed both empires the russian revolution of 1917 led to the founding of the soviet union under the bolsheviks and subsequent civil war in russia a ukrainian national movement for self-determination re-emerged with heavy communist and socialist influence several ukrainian states briefly emerged the internationally recognized ukrainian peoples republic unr the predecessor of modern ukraine was declared on 23 june 1917 proclaimed at first as a part of the russian republic after the bolshevik revolution the ukrainian peoples republic proclaimed its independence on 25 january 1918 the hetmanate the directorate and the pro-bolshevik ukrainian soviet socialist republic or soviet ukraine successively established territories in the former russian empire while the west ukrainian peoples republic and the hutsul republic emerged briefly in the ukrainian lands of former austro-hungarian territoryact zluky unification act was an agreement signed on january 22 1919 by the ukrainian peoples republic and the west ukrainian peoples republic on the st sophia square in kievthis led to civil war and an anarchist movement called the black army or later the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine developed in southern ukraine under the command of the anarchist nestor makhno during the russian civil war they protected the operation of free soviets and libertarian communes in the free territory an attempt to form a stateless anarchist society from 1918 to 1921 during the ukrainian revolution fighting both the tsarist white army under denikin and later the red army under trotsky before being defeated by the latter in august 1921
poland defeated western ukraine in the polish-ukrainian war but failed against the bolsheviks in an offensive against kiev according to the peace of riga western ukraine was incorporated into poland which in turn recognised the ukrainian soviet socialist republic in march 1919 with establishment of the soviet power ukraine lost half of its territory to poland belarus and russia while on the left bank of dniester river was created moldavian autonomy ukraine became a founding member of the union of soviet socialist republics in december 1922


 western ukraine carpathian ruthenia and bukovina 

the war in ukraine continued for another two years by 1921 however most of ukraine had been taken over by the soviet union while galicia and volhynia west ukraine were incorporated into independent poland bukovina was annexed by romania and carpathian ruthenia was admitted to the czechoslovak republic as an autonomy

a powerful underground ukrainian nationalist movement arose in poland in the 1920s and 1930s which was formed by ukrainian veterans of the ukrainian-soviet war including yevhen konovalets andriy melnyk and yuriy tyutyunyk and was transformed into the ukrainian military organization and later the organisation of ukrainian nationalists oun the movement attracted a militant following among students hostilities between polish state authorities and the popular movement led to a substantial number of fatalities and the autonomy which had been promised was never implemented a number of ukrainian parties the ukrainian catholic church an active press and a business sector existed in poland economic conditions improved in the 1920s but the region suffered from the great depression in the 1930s


 inter-war soviet ukraine 

the russian civil war devastated the whole russian empire including ukraine it left over 1.5 million people dead and hundreds of thousands homeless in the former russian empire territory soviet ukraine also faced the russian famine of 1921 primarily affecting the russian volga-ural region during the 1920s under the ukrainisation policy pursued by the national communist leadership of mykola skrypnyk soviet leadership encouraged a national renaissance in the ukrainian culture and language ukrainisation was part of the soviet-wide policy of korenisation literally indigenisation the bolsheviks were also committed to universal health care education and social-security benefits as well as the right to work and housing womens rights were greatly increased through new laws most of these policies were sharply reversed by the early 1930s after joseph stalin became the de facto communist party leader

starting from the late 1920s with a centrally planned economy ukraine was involved in soviet industrialisation and the republics industrial output quadrupled during the 1930s the peasantry suffered from the programme of collectivisation of agriculture which began during and was part of the first five-year plan and was enforced by regular troops and secret police those who resisted were arrested and deported and agricultural productivity greatly declined as members of the collective farms were sometimes not allowed to receive any grain until unrealistic quotas were met millions starved to death in a famine known as the holodomor or the great faminescholars are divided as to whether this famine fits the definition of genocide but the ukrainian parliament and the governments of other countries have acknowledged it as suchthe communist leadership perceived famine as a means of class struggle and used starvation as a punishment tool to force peasants into collective farms

largely the same groups were responsible for the mass killing operations during the civil war collectivisation and the great terror these groups were associated with yefim yevdokimov 1891–1939 and operated in the secret operational division within general state political administration ogpu in 1929–31 evdokimov transferred into communist party administration in 1934 when he became party secretary for north caucasus krai he appears to have continued advising joseph stalin and nikolai yezhov on security matters and the latter relied on evdokimovs former colleagues to carry out the mass killing operations that are known as the great terror in 1937–38on 13 january 2010 kiev appellate court posthumously found stalin kaganovich and other soviet communist party functionaries guilty of genocide against ukrainians during the holodomor famine


 world war ii 

following the invasion of poland in september 1939 german and soviet troops divided the territory of poland thus eastern galicia and volhynia with their ukrainian population became part of ukraine for the first time in history the nation was unitedin 1940 the soviets annexed bessarabia and northern bukovina the ukrainian ssr incorporated the northern and southern districts of bessarabia northern bukovina and the hertsa region but it ceded the western part of the moldavian autonomous soviet socialist republic to the newly created moldavian soviet socialist republic these territorial gains of the ussr were internationally recognized by the paris peace treaties of 1947

german armies invaded the soviet union on 22 june 1941 initiating nearly four years of total war the axis initially advanced against desperate but unsuccessful efforts of the red army in the encirclement battle of kiev the city was acclaimed as a hero city because of its fierce resistance more than 600,000 soviet soldiers or one-quarter of the soviet western front were killed or taken captive there with many suffering severe mistreatmentalthough the majority of ukrainians fought in or alongside the red army and soviet resistance in western ukraine an independent ukrainian insurgent army movement arose upa 1942 created as armed forces of the underground organization of ukrainian nationalists oun which had developed in interwar poland as a reactionary nationalist organization during the interwar period the polish governments policies towards the ukrainian minority were initially very accommodating however by the late 1930s they became increasingly harsh due to civil unrest both organizations oun and upa supported the goal of an independent ukrainian state on the territory with a ukrainian ethnic majority although this brought conflict with nazi germany at times the melnyk wing of the oun allied with the nazi forces also upa divisions carried out massacres of ethnic poles which brought reprisals after the war the upa continued to fight the ussr until the 1950s at the same time the ukrainian liberation army another nationalist movement fought alongside the nazis

in total the number of ethnic ukrainians who fought in the ranks of the soviet army is estimated from 4.5 million to 7 million the pro-soviet partisan guerrilla resistance in ukraine is estimated to number at 47,800 from the start of occupation to 500,000 at its peak in 1944 with about 50% being ethnic ukrainians generally the ukrainian insurgent armys figures are unreliable with figures ranging anywhere from 15,000 to as many as 100,000 fightersmost of the ukrainian ssr was organised within the reichskommissariat ukraine with the intention of exploiting its resources and eventual german settlement some western ukrainians who had only joined the soviet union in 1939 hailed the germans as liberators brutal german rule eventually turned their supporters against the nazi administrators who made little attempt to exploit dissatisfaction with stalinist policies instead the nazis preserved the collective-farm system carried out genocidal policies against jews deported millions of people to work in germany and began a depopulation program to prepare for german colonisation they blockaded the transport of food on the kiev riverthe vast majority of the fighting in world war ii took place on the eastern front by some estimates 93% of all german casualties took place there the total losses inflicted upon the ukrainian population during the war are estimated at between 5 and 8 million including an estimated one and a half million jews killed by the einsatzgruppen sometimes with the help of local collaborators of the estimated 8.7 million soviet troops who fell in battle against the nazis 1.4 million were ethnic ukrainians victory day is celebrated as one of ten ukrainian national holidays


 post-world war ii 

the republic was heavily damaged by the war and it required significant efforts to recover more than 700 cities and towns and 28,000 villages were destroyed the situation was worsened by a famine in 1946–47 which was caused by a drought and the wartime destruction of infrastructure the death toll of this famine varies with even the lowest estimate in the tens of thousands
in 1945 the ukrainian ssr became one of the founding members of the united nations organization part of a special agreement at the yalta conference

post-war ethnic cleansing occurred in the newly expanded soviet union as of 1 january 1953 ukrainians were second only to russians among adult special deportees comprising 20% of the total in addition over 450,000 ethnic germans from ukraine and more than 200,000 crimean tatars were victims of forced deportationsfollowing the death of stalin in 1953 nikita khrushchev became the new leader of the ussr having served as first secretary of the communist party of ukrainian ssr in 1938–49 khrushchev was intimately familiar with the republic after taking power union-wide he began to emphasize the friendship between the ukrainian and russian nations in 1954 the 300th anniversary of the treaty of pereyaslav was widely celebrated crimea was transferred from the russian sfsr to the ukrainian ssrby 1950 the republic had fully surpassed pre-war levels of industry and production during the 1946–1950 five-year plan nearly 20% of the soviet budget was invested in soviet ukraine a 5% increase from pre-war plans as a result the ukrainian workforce rose 33.2% from 1940 to 1955 while industrial output grew 2.2 times in that same periodsoviet ukraine soon became a european leader in industrial production and an important centre of the soviet arms industry and high-tech research such an important role resulted in a major influence of the local elite many members of the soviet leadership came from ukraine most notably leonid brezhnev he later ousted khrushchev and became the soviet leader from 1964 to 1982 many prominent soviet sports players scientists and artists came from ukraineon 26 april 1986 a reactor in the chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded resulting in the chernobyl disaster the worst nuclear reactor accident in history this was the only accident to receive the highest possible rating of 7 by the international nuclear event scale indicating a major accident until the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster in march 2011 at the time of the accident 7 million people lived in the contaminated territories including 2.2 million in ukraineafter the accident the new city of slavutych was built outside the exclusion zone to house and support the employees of the plant which was decommissioned in 2000 a report prepared by the international atomic energy agency and world health organization attributed 56 direct deaths to the accident and estimated that there may have been 4,000 extra cancer deaths

 historical maps of states 
several states have existed on the territory of present-day ukraine since its foundation most of these territories have been located within eastern europe however as depicted in the maps here they have at times extended well into eurasia and southeastern europe at other times there has been no distinct ukrainian state its territories having been annexed by its more powerful neighbours

		
		
		
		


 geography 

at 603,628 square kilometres 233,062 sq mi and with a coastline of 2,782 kilometres 1,729 mi ukraine is the worlds 46th-largest country after south sudan and before madagascar it is the largest wholly european country and the second-largest country in europe after the european part of russia before metropolitan france it lies between latitudes 44° and 53° n and longitudes 22° and 41° e
the landscape of ukraine consists mostly of fertile plains or steppes and plateaus crossed by rivers such as the dnieper dnipro seversky donets dniester and the southern bug as they flow south into the black sea and the smaller sea of azov to the southwest the delta of the danube forms the border with romania ukraines various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the highlands to the lowlands the countrys only mountains are the carpathian mountains in the west of which the highest is the hora hoverla at 2,061 metres 6,762 ft and the crimean mountains on crimea in the extreme south along the coast however ukraine also has a number of highland regions such as the volyn-podillia upland in the west and the near-dnipro upland on the right bank of dnieper to the east there are the south-western spurs of the central russian upland over which runs the border with the russian federation near the sea of azov can be found the donets ridge and the near azov upland the snow melt from the mountains feeds the rivers and natural changes in altitude form sudden drops in elevation and give rise to waterfalls

		
		
		
		
		
		

significant natural resources in ukraine include iron ore coal manganese natural gas oil salt sulphur graphite titanium magnesium kaolin nickel mercury timber and an abundance of arable land despite this the country faces a number of major environmental issues such as inadequate supplies of potable water air- and water-pollution and deforestation as well as radiation contamination in the north-east from the 1986 accident at the chernobyl nuclear power plant recycling toxic household waste is still in its infancy in ukraine


 soil 
from northwest to southeast the soils of ukraine may be divided into three major aggregations
a zone of sandy podzolized soils
a central belt consisting of the black extremely fertile ukrainian chernozems
a zone of chestnut and salinized soilsas much as two-thirds of the countrys surface land consists of the so-called black earth chornozem a resource that has made ukraine one of the most fertile regions in the world and well known as a breadbasket these chornozem soils may be divided into three broad groups

in the north a belt of the so-called deep chernozems about 5 feet 1.5 metres thick and rich in humus
south and east of the former a zone of prairie or ordinary chernozems which are equally rich in humus but only about 3 feet 0.91 metres thick
the southernmost belt which is even thinner and has still less humusinterspersed in various uplands and along the northern and western perimeters of the deep chernozems are mixtures of gray forest soils and podzolized black-earth soils which together occupy much of ukraines remaining area all these soils are very fertile when sufficient water is available however their intensive cultivation especially on steep slopes has led to widespread soil erosion and gullying
the smallest proportion of the soil cover consists of the chestnut soils of the southern and eastern regions they become increasingly salinized to the south as they approach the black sea


 biodiversity 

ukraine is home to a diverse assemblage of animals fungi microorganisms and plants


 animals 

ukraine is divided into two main zoological areas one of these areas in the west of the country is made up of the borderlands of europe where there are species typical of mixed forests the other is located in eastern ukraine where steppe-dwelling species thrive in the forested areas of the country it is not uncommon to find lynxes wolves wild boar and martens as well as many other similar species this is especially true of the carpathian mountains where a large number of predatory mammals make their home as well as a contingent of brown bears around ukraines lakes and rivers beavers otters and mink make their home whilst in the waters carp bream and catfish are the most commonly found species of fish in the central and eastern parts of the country rodents such as hamsters and gophers are found in large numbers


 fungi 
more than 6,600 species of fungi including lichen-forming species have been recorded from ukraine but this number is far from complete the true total number of fungal species occurring in ukraine including species not yet recorded is likely to be far higher given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered although the amount of available information is still very small a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to ukraine and 2217 such species have been tentatively identified


 climate 

ukraine has a mostly temperate climate with the exception of the southern coast of crimea which has a subtropical climate
the climate is influenced by moderately warm humid air coming from the atlantic ocean average annual temperatures range from 5.5–7 °c 41.9–44.6 °f in the north to 11–13 °c 51.8–55.4 °f in the south precipitation is disproportionately distributed it is highest in the west and north and lowest in the east and southeast western ukraine particularly in the carpathian mountains receives around 1,200 millimetres 47.2 in of precipitation annually while crimea and the coastal areas of the black sea receive around 400 millimetres 15.7 in


 politics 

ukraine is a republic under a mixed semi-parliamentary semi-presidential system with separate legislative executive and judicial branches


 constitution of ukraine 

with the proclamation of its independence on 24 august 1991 and adoption of a constitution on 28 june 1996 ukraine became a semi-presidential republic however in 2004 deputies introduced changes to the constitution which tipped the balance of power in favour of a parliamentary system from 2004 to 2010 the legitimacy of the 2004 constitutional amendments had official sanction both with the constitutional court of ukraine and most major political parties despite this on 30 september 2010 the constitutional court ruled that the amendments were null and void forcing a return to the terms of the 1996 constitution and again making ukraines political system more presidential in character
the ruling on the 2004 constitutional amendments became a major topic of political discourse much of the concern was based on the fact that neither the constitution of 1996 nor the constitution of 2004 provided the ability to undo the constitution as the decision of the constitutional court would have it even though the 2004 constitution arguably has an exhaustive list of possible procedures for constitutional amendments articles 154–159 in any case the current constitution could be modified by a vote in parliamenton 21 february 2014 an agreement between president viktor yanukovych and opposition leaders saw the country return to the 2004 constitution the historic agreement brokered by the european union followed protests that began in late november 2013 and culminated in a week of violent clashes in which scores of protesters were killed in addition to returning the country to the 2004 constitution the deal provided for the formation of a coalition government the calling of early elections and the release of former prime minister yulia tymoshenko from prison a day after the agreement was reached the ukraine parliament dismissed yanukovych and installed its speaker oleksandr turchynov as interim president and arseniy yatsenyuk as the prime minister of ukraine


 president parliament and government 

the president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and is the formal head of state
ukraines legislative branch includes the 450-seat unicameral parliament the verkhovna rada the parliament is primarily responsible for the formation of the executive branch and the cabinet of ministers headed by the prime minister however the president still retains the authority to nominate the ministers of the foreign affairs and of defence for parliamentary approval as well as the power to appoint the prosecutor general and the head of the security service
laws acts of the parliament and the cabinet presidential decrees and acts of the crimean parliament may be abrogated by the constitutional court should they be found to violate the constitution other normative acts are subject to judicial review the supreme court is the main body in the system of courts of general jurisdiction
local self-government is officially guaranteed local councils and city mayors are popularly elected and exercise control over local budgets the heads of regional and district administrations are appointed by the president in accordance with the proposals of the prime minister this system virtually requires an agreement between the president and the prime minister and has in the past led to problems such as when president yushchenko exploited a perceived loophole by appointing so-called temporarily acting officers instead of actual governors or local leaders thus evading the need to seek a compromise with the prime minister this practice was controversial and was subject to constitutional court review
ukraine has a large number of political parties many of which have tiny memberships and are unknown to the general public small parties often join in multi-party coalitions electoral blocs for the purpose of participating in parliamentary elections


 courts and law enforcement 

the courts enjoy legal financial and constitutional freedom guaranteed by ukrainian law since 2002 judges are largely well protected from dismissal except in the instance of gross misconduct court justices are appointed by presidential decree for an initial period of five years after which ukraines supreme council confirms their positions for life although there are still problems the system is considered to have been much improved since ukraines independence in 1991 the supreme court is regarded as an independent and impartial body and has on several occasions ruled against the ukrainian government the world justice project ranks ukraine 66 out of 99 countries surveyed in its annual rule of law index

prosecutors in ukraine have greater powers than in most european countries and according to the european commission for democracy through law the role and functions of the prosecutors office is not in accordance with council of europe standards the criminal judicial system maintains an average conviction rate of over 99 equal to the conviction rate of the soviet union with suspects often being incarcerated for long periods before trial on 24 march 2010 president yanukovych formed an expert group to make recommendations how to clean up the current mess and adopt a law on court organization one day later he stated we can no longer disgrace our country with such a court system the criminal judicial system and the prison system of ukraine remain quite punitive
since 1 january 2010 it has been permissible to hold court proceedings in russian by mutual consent of the parties citizens unable to speak ukrainian or russian may use their native language or the services of a translator previously all court proceedings had to be held in ukrainian
law enforcement agencies in ukraine are organised under the authority of the ministry of internal affairs they consist primarily of the national police force мiлiцiя and various specialised units and agencies such as the state border guard and the coast guard services law enforcement agencies particularly the police faced criticism for their heavy handling of the 2004 orange revolution many thousands of police officers were stationed throughout the capital primarily to dissuade protesters from challenging the states authority but also to provide a quick reaction force in case of need most officers were armed bloodshed was only avoided when lt gen sergei popkov heeded his colleagues calls to withdraw
the ministry of internal affairs is also responsible for the maintenance of the state security service ukraines domestic intelligence agency which has on occasion been accused of acting like a secret police force serving to protect the countrys political elite from media criticism on the other hand however it is widely accepted that members of the service provided vital information about government plans to the leaders of the orange revolution to prevent the collapse of the movement


 foreign relations 

in 1999–2001 ukraine served as a non-permanent member of the un security council historically soviet ukraine joined the united nations in 1945 as one of the original members following a western compromise with the soviet union which had asked for seats for all 15 of its union republics ukraine has consistently supported peaceful negotiated settlements to disputes it has participated in the quadripartite talks on the conflict in moldova and promoted a peaceful resolution to conflict in the post-soviet state of georgia ukraine also has made a substantial contribution to un peacekeeping operations since 1992

ukraine currently considers euro-atlantic integration its primary foreign policy objective but in practice it has always balanced its relationship with the european union and the united states with strong ties to russia the european unions partnership and cooperation agreement pca with ukraine went into force on 1 march 1998 the european union eu has encouraged ukraine to implement the pca fully before discussions begin on an association agreement issued at the eu summit in december 1999 in helsinki recognizes ukraines long-term aspirations but does not discuss association on 31 january 1992 ukraine joined the then-conference on security and cooperation in europe now the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce and on 10 march 1992 it became a member of the north atlantic cooperation council ukraine–nato relations are close and the country has declared interest in eventual membership this was removed from the governments foreign policy agenda upon election of viktor yanukovych to the presidency in 2010 but after february 2014s yanukovych ouster and the denied by russia following russian military intervention in ukraine ukraine renewed its drive for nato membership ukraine is the most active member of the partnership for peace pfp all major political parties in ukraine support full eventual integration into the european union the association agreement with the eu was expected to be signed and put into effect by the end of 2011 but the process was suspended by 2012 because of the political developments of that time the association agreement between ukraine and the european union was signed in 2014ukraine long had close ties with all its neighbours but russia–ukraine relations became difficult in 2014 by the annexation of crimea energy dependence and payment disputes there are also tensions with poland and hungaryukraine is included in the european unions european neighbourhood policy enp which aims at bringing the eu and its neighbours closer


 administrative divisions 

the system of ukrainian subdivisions reflects the countrys status as a unitary state as stated in the countrys constitution with unified legal and administrative regimes for each unit
including sevastopol and the autonomous republic of crimea that were annexed by the russian federation in 2014 ukraine consists of 27 regions twenty-four oblasts provinces one autonomous republic autonomous republic of crimea and two cities of special status – kiev the capital and sevastopol the 24 oblasts and crimea are subdivided into 490 raions districts and city municipalities of regional significance or second-level administrative units the average area of a ukrainian raion is 1,200 square kilometres 460 sq mi the average population of a raion is 52,000 peoplepopulated places in ukraine are split into two categories urban and rural urban populated places are split further into cities and urban-type settlements a soviet administrative invention while rural populated places consist of villages and settlements a generally used term all cities have certain degree of self-rule depending on their significance such as national significance as in the case of kiev and sevastopol regional significance within each oblast or autonomous republic or district significance all the rest of cities citys significance depends on several factors such as its population socio-economic and historical importance infrastructure and others


 armed forces 

after the dissolution of the soviet union ukraine inherited a 780,000-man military force on its territory equipped with the third-largest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world in may 1992 ukraine signed the lisbon protocol in which the country agreed to give up all nuclear weapons to russia for disposal and to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a non-nuclear weapon state ukraine ratified the treaty in 1994 and by 1996 the country became free of nuclear weaponsukraine took consistent steps toward reduction of conventional weapons it signed the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe which called for reduction of tanks artillery and armoured vehicles army forces were reduced to 300,000 the country plans to convert the current conscript-based military into a professional volunteer military

 economy 

in soviet times the economy of ukraine was the second largest in the soviet union being an important industrial and agricultural component of the countrys planned economy with the dissolution of the soviet system the country moved from a planned economy to a market economy the transition was difficult for the majority of the population which plunged into poverty ukraines economy contracted severely in the years after the soviet dissolution day-to-day life for the average person living in ukraine was a struggle a significant number of citizens in rural ukraine survived by growing their own food often working two or more jobs and buying the basic necessities through the barter economyin 1991 the government liberalised most prices to combat widespread product shortages and was successful in overcoming the problem at the same time the government continued to subsidise state-run industries and agriculture by uncovered monetary emission the loose monetary policies of the early 1990s pushed inflation to hyperinflationary levels for the year 1993 ukraine holds the world record for inflation in one calendar year those living on fixed incomes suffered the most prices stabilised only after the introduction of new currency the hryvnia in 1996 the country was also slow in implementing structural reforms following independence the government formed a legal framework for privatisation however widespread resistance to reforms within the government and from a significant part of the population soon stalled the reform efforts a large number of state-owned enterprises were exempt from privatisation

in the meantime by 1999 the gdp had fallen to less than 40% of the 1991 level it recovered considerably in the following years but as at 2014 had yet to reach the historical maximum in the early 2000s the economy showed strong export-based growth of 5 to 10 with industrial production growing more than 10% per year ukraine was hit by the economic crisis of 2008 and in november 2008 the imf approved a stand-by loan of 16.5 billion for the countryukraines 2010 gdp ppp as calculated by the cia is ranked 38th in the world and estimated at 305.2 billion its gdp per capita in 2010 according to the cia was 6,700 in ppp terms ranked 107th in the world nominal gdp in us dollars calculated at market exchange rate was 136 billion ranked 53rd in the world by july 2008 the average nominal salary in ukraine reached 1,930 hryvnias per month despite remaining lower than in neighbouring central european countries the salary income growth in 2008 stood at 36.8as of 2016 ukraine had average wealth per adult at 1,254 in 2017 ukraines government debt was 75

the phenomenon of lowest-low fertility defined as total fertility below 1.3 is emerging throughout europe and is attributed by many to postponement of the initiation of childbearing ukraine where total fertility a very low 1.1 in 2001 was one of the worlds lowest shows that there is more than one pathway to lowest-low fertility although ukraine has undergone immense political and economic transformations during 1991–2004 it has maintained a young age at first birth and nearly universal childbearing analysis of official national statistics and the ukrainian reproductive health survey show that fertility declined to very low levels without a transition to a later pattern of childbearing findings from focus group interviews suggest explanations of the early fertility pattern these findings include the persistence of traditional norms for childbearing and the roles of men and women concerns about medical complications and infertility at a later age and the link between early fertility and early marriageto help mitigate the declining population the government continues to increase child support payments thus it provides one-time payments of 12,250 hryvnias for the first child 25,000 hryvnias for the second and 50,000 hryvnias for the third and fourth along with monthly payments of 154 hryvnias per child the demographic trend is showing signs of improvement as the birth rate has been steadily growing since 2001 net population growth over the first nine months of 2007 was registered in five provinces of the country out of 24 and population shrinkage was showing signs of stabilising nationwide in 2007 the highest birth rates were in the western oblasts in 2008 ukraine emerged from lowest-low fertility and the upward trend has continued since except for a slight dip in 2010 because of the economic crisis of 2009 see demographic tables

 culture 

ukrainian customs are heavily influenced by orthodox christianity the dominant religion in the country gender roles also tend to be more traditional and grandparents play a greater role in bringing up children than in the west the culture of ukraine has also been influenced by its eastern and western neighbours reflected in its architecture music and artthe communist era had quite a strong effect on the art and writing of ukraine in 1932 stalin made socialist realism state policy in the soviet union when he promulgated the decree on the reconstruction of literary and art organisations this greatly stifled creativity during the 1980s glasnost openness was introduced and soviet artists and writers again became free to express themselves as they wantedthe tradition of the easter egg known as pysanky has long roots in ukraine these eggs were drawn on with wax to create a pattern then the dye was applied to give the eggs their pleasant colours the dye did not affect the previously wax-coated parts of the egg after the entire egg was dyed the wax was removed leaving only the colourful pattern this tradition is thousands of years old and precedes the arrival of christianity to ukraine in the city of kolomyia near the foothills of the carpathian mountains in 2000 was built the museum of pysanka which won a nomination as the monument of modern ukraine in 2007 part of the seven wonders of ukraine action

 literature 

the history of ukrainian literature dates back to the 11th century following the christianisation of the kievan rus the writings of the time were mainly liturgical and were written in old church slavonic historical accounts of the time were referred to as chronicles the most significant of which was the primary chronicle literary activity faced a sudden decline during the mongol invasion of rusukrainian literature again began to develop in the 14th century and was advanced significantly in the 16th century with the introduction of print and with the beginning of the cossack era under both russian and polish dominance the cossacks established an independent society and popularized a new kind of epic poems which marked a high point of ukrainian oral literature these advances were then set back in the 17th and early 18th centuries when publishing in the ukrainian language was outlawed and prohibited nonetheless by the late 18th century modern literary ukrainian finally emergedthe 19th century initiated a vernacular period in ukraine led by ivan kotliarevskys work eneyida the first publication written in modern ukrainian by the 1830s ukrainian romanticism began to develop and the nations most renowned cultural figure romanticist poet-painter taras shevchenko emerged where ivan kotliarevsky is considered to be the father of literature in the ukrainian vernacular shevchenko is the father of a national revivalthen in 1863 use of the ukrainian language in print was effectively prohibited by the russian empire this severely curtailed literary activity in the area and ukrainian writers were forced to either publish their works in russian or release them in austrian controlled galicia the ban was never officially lifted but it became obsolete after the revolution and the bolsheviks coming to powerukrainian literature continued to flourish in the early soviet years when nearly all literary trends were approved the most important literary figures of that time were mykola khvylovy valerian pidmohylny mykola kulish mykhayl semenko and some others these policies faced a steep decline in the 1930s when prominent representatives as well as many others were killed by nkvd as part of the great purge in general around 223 writers were repressed by what was known as the executed renaissance these repressions were part of stalins implemented policy of socialist realism the doctrine did not necessarily repress the use of the ukrainian language but it required that writers follow a certain style in their works
in post-stalinist times literary activities continued to be somewhat limited under the communist party the most famous figures of ukrainian post-war soviet literature were lina kostenko dmytro pavlychko borys oliynyk poet ivan drach oles honchar vasyl stus vasyl symonenko
literary freedom grew in the late 1980s and early 1990s alongside the decline and collapse of the ussr and the reestablishment of ukrainian independence in 1991


 architecture 

ukrainian architecture includes the motifs and styles that are found in structures built in modern ukraine and by ukrainians worldwide
these include initial roots which were established in the eastern slavic state of kievan rus since the christianization of kievan rus for several ages ukrainian architecture was influenced by the byzantine architecture after the 12th century the distinct architectural history continued in the principalities of galicia-volhynia during the epoch of the zaporozhian cossacks a new style unique to ukraine was developed under the western influences of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth after the union with the tsardom of russia many structures in the larger eastern russian-ruled area were built in the styles of russian architecture of that period whilst the western galicia was developed under austro-hungarian architectural influences ukrainian national motifs would finally be used during the period of the soviet union and in modern independent ukraine
the great churches of the rus built after the adoption of christianity in 988 were the first examples of monumental architecture in the east slavic lands the architectural style of the kievan state was strongly influenced by the byzantine early eastern orthodox churches were mainly made of wood with the simplest form of church becoming known as a cell church major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes which led some art historians to take this as an indication of the appearance of pre-christian pagan slavic temples
several examples of these churches survive however during the 16th 17th and 18th centuries many were externally rebuilt in the ukrainian baroque style see below examples include the grand st sophia of kiev – the year 1017 is the earliest record of foundation laid church of the saviour at berestove – built from 1113 to 1125 and st cyrils church circa 12th-century all can still be found in the ukrainian capital several buildings were reconstructed during the late-19th century including the assumption cathedral in volodymyr-volynskyi built in 1160 and reconstructed in 1896–1900 the paraskevi church in chernihiv built in 1201 with reconstruction done in the late 1940s and the golden gates in kiev built in 1037 and reconstructed in 1982 the latters reconstruction was criticised by some art and architecture historians as a revivalist fantasy unfortunately little secular or vernacular architecture of kievan rus has survived
as ukraine became increasingly integrated into the russian empire russian architects had the opportunity to realise their projects in the picturesque landscape that many ukrainian cities and regions offered st andrews church of kiev 1747–1754 built by bartolomeo rastrelli is a notable example of baroque architecture and its location on top of the kievan mountain made it a recognisable monument of the city an equally notable contribution of rasetrelli was the mariyinsky palace which was built to be a summer residence to russian empress elizabeth during the reign of the last hetman of ukraine kirill razumovsky many of the cossack hetmanates towns such as hlukhiv baturyn and koselets had grandiose projects built by andrey kvasov russia eventually conquered the south of ukraine and crimea and renamed them as new russia new cities such as nikolayev odessa kherson and sevastopol were founded these would contain notable examples of imperial russian architecture

		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		

in 1934 the capital of soviet ukraine moved from kharkiv to kiev previously the city was seen as only a regional centre hence received little attention all of that was to change at great price the first examples of stalinist architecture were already showing and in light of the official policy a new city was to be built on top of the old one this meant that much-admired examples such as the st michaels golden-domed monastery were destroyed even the st sophia cathedral was under threat also the second world war contributed to the wreckage after the war a new project for the reconstruction of central kiev transformed khreshchatyk avenue into a notable example of stalinism in architecture however by 1955 the new politics of architecture once again stopped the project from fully being realised
the task for modern ukrainian architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics the search for an architects own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment an example of modern ukrainian architecture is the reconstruction and renewal of the maidan nezalezhnosti in central kiev despite the limit set by narrow space within the plaza the engineers were able to blend together the uneven landscape and use underground space for a new shopping centre
a major project which may take up most of the 21st century is the construction of the kiev city-centre on the rybalskyi peninsula which when finished will include a dense skyscraper park amid the picturesque landscape of the dnieper


 music 

music is a major part of ukrainian culture with a long history and many influences from traditional folk music to classical and modern rock ukraine has produced several internationally recognised musicians including kirill karabits okean elzy and ruslana elements from traditional ukrainian folk music made their way into western music and even into modern jazz

ukrainian music sometimes presents a perplexing mix of exotic melismatic singing with chordal harmony the most striking general characteristic of authentic ethnic ukrainian folk music is the wide use of minor modes or keys which incorporate augmented 2nd intervals
during the baroque period music was an important discipline for those that had received a higher education in ukraine it had a place of considerable importance in the curriculum of the kyiv-mohyla academy much of the nobility was well versed in music with many ukrainian cossack leaders such as mazepa paliy holovatyj sirko being accomplished players of the kobza bandura or torban
the first dedicated musical academy was set up in hlukhiv ukraine in 1738 and students were taught to sing play violin and bandura from manuscripts as a result many of the earliest composers and performers within the russian empire were ethnically ukrainian having been born or educated in hlukhiv or had been closely associated with this music school
see dmytro bortniansky maksym berezovsky and artemiy vedel

ukrainian classical music falls into three distinct categories defined by whether the composer was of ukrainian ethnicity living in ukraine a composer of non-ukrainian ethnicity who was born or at some time was a citizen of ukraine or an ethnic ukrainian living outside of ukraine within the ukrainian diaspora the music of these three groups differs considerably as do the audiences for whom they cater
since the mid-1960s western-influenced pop music has been growing in popularity in ukraine folk singer and harmonium player mariana sadovska is prominent ukrainian pop and folk music arose with the international popularity of groups and performers like vopli vidoplyasova dakh daughters dakha brakha ivan dorn and okean elzy
modern musical culture of ukraine is presented both with academic and entertainment music ukraine has five conservatories 6 opera houses five houses of chamber music philharmony in all regional centers
ukraine hosted the eurovision song contest 2005 and the eurovision song contest 2017
