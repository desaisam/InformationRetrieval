colonialism is the policy of a foreign polity seeking to extend or retain its authority over other people or territories generally with the aim of opening trade opportunities the colonizing country seeks to benefit from the colonized country or land mass in the process colonizers imposed their religion economics and medicinal practices on the natives some argue this was a positive move toward modernization while other scholars refute this theory as being biased and eurocentric noting that modernization is a concept introduced by europeans colonialism is largely regarded as a relationship of domination of an indigenous majority by a minority of foreign invaders where the latter rule in pursuit of its interestsearly records of colonization go as far back as phoenicians an enterprising maritime trading culture that spread across the mediterranean from 1550 bc to 300 bc and later the greeks and persians continued on this line of setting up colonies the romans would soon follow setting up colonies throughout the mediterranean northern africa and western asia in the 9th century a new wave of mediterranean colonization had begun between competing states such as the islamic ottomans and the venetians genovese and amalfians invading the wealthy previously byzantine or eastern roman islands and lands venice began with the conquest of dalmatia and reached its greatest nominal extent at the conclusion of the fourth crusade in 1204 with the declaration of the acquisition of three octaves of the byzantine empire
later in the 15th century some european states established their own empires during the european colonial period the belgian british danish dutch french portuguese russian spanish and swedish empires established colonies across large areas imperial japan the ottoman empire and the united states also acquired colonies as did imperialist china and finally in the late 19th century the german and the italian
at first european colonizing countries followed policies of mercantilism in order to strengthen the home economy so agreements usually restricted the colonies to trading only with the metropole mother country by the mid-19th century however the british empire gave up mercantilism and trade restrictions and adopted the principle of free trade with few restrictions or tariffs christian missionaries were active in practically all of the colonies because the colonialists were christians historian philip hoffman calculated that by 1800 before the industrial revolution europeans already controlled at least 35% of the globe and by 1914 they had gained control of 84
in the aftermath of world war ii the archetypal european colonial system practically ended between 1945–1975 when nearly all europes colonies gained political independence


 definitions 

collins english dictionary defines colonialism as the policy and practice of a power in extending control over weaker peoples or areas websters encyclopedic dictionary defines colonialism as the system or policy of a nation seeking to extend or retain its authority over other people or territories the merriam-webster dictionary offers four definitions including something characteristic of a colony and control by one power over a dependent area or peoplethe stanford encyclopedia of philosophy uses the term colonialism to describe the process of european settlement and political control over the rest of the world including the americas australia and parts of africa and asia it discusses the distinction between colonialism and imperialism and states that given the difficulty of consistently distinguishing between the two terms this entry will use colonialism as a broad concept that refers to the project of european political domination from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries that ended with the national liberation movements of the 1960sin his preface to jürgen osterhammels colonialism a theoretical overview roger tignor says for osterhammel the essence of colonialism is the existence of colonies which are by definition governed differently from other territories such as protectorates or informal spheres of influence in the book osterhammel asks how can colonialism be defined independently from colony he settles on a three-sentence definition

colonialism is a relationship between an indigenous or forcibly imported majority and a minority of foreign invaders the fundamental decisions affecting the lives of the colonized people are made and implemented by the colonial rulers in pursuit of interests that are often defined in a distant metropolis rejecting cultural compromises with the colonized population the colonizers are convinced of their own superiority and their ordained mandate to rule


 types of colonialism 

historians often distinguish between various overlapping forms of colonialism which are classified into four types settler colonialism exploitation colonialism surrogate colonialism and internal colonialism
settler colonialism involves large-scale immigration often motivated by religious political or economic reasons it pursues to replace the original population here a large number of people emigrate to the colony for the purpose of staying and cultivating the land australia canada israel south africa and the united states are all examples of current settler colonial societies
exploitation colonialism involves fewer colonists and focuses on the exploitation of natural resources or population as labor typically to the benefit of the metropole this category includes trading posts as well as larger colonies where colonists would constitute much of the political and economic administration prior to the end of the slave trade and widespread abolition when indigenous labor was unavailable slaves were often imported to the americas first by the portuguese empire and later by the spanish dutch french and british
surrogate colonialism involves a settlement project supported by a colonial power in which most of the settlers do not come from a same ethnic group as the ruling power
internal colonialism is a notion of uneven structural power between areas of a state the source of exploitation comes from within the state this is demonstrated in the way control and exploitation passes from whites in the colonizing country to white immigrant population within a newly independent country


 socio-cultural evolution 
as colonialism often played out in pre-populated areas sociocultural evolution included the formation of various ethnically hybrid populations colonialism gave rise to culturally and ethnically mixed populations such as the mestizos of the americas as well as racially divided populations such as those found in french algeria or in southern rhodesia in fact everywhere where colonial powers established a consistent and continued presence hybrid communities existed
notable examples in asia include the anglo-burmese anglo-indian burgher eurasian singaporean filipino mestizo kristang and macanese peoples in the dutch east indies later indonesia the vast majority of dutch settlers were in fact eurasians known as indo-europeans formally belonging to the european legal class in the colony see also indos in pre-colonial history and indos in colonial history


 history 

activity that could be called colonialism has a long history starting with the pre-colonial african empires which led to the egyptians phoenicians greeks and romans who all built colonies in antiquity the word metropole comes from the greek metropolis greek μητρόπολισ—mother city the word colony comes from the latin colonia—a place for agriculture between the 11th and 18th centuries the vietnamese established military colonies south of their original territory and absorbed the territory in a process known as nam tiếnmodern colonialism started with the age of discovery spain initially the crown of castile and soon later portugal encountered the americas through sea travel and built trading posts or conquered large extensions of land for some people it is this building of colonies across oceans that differentiates colonialism from other types of expansionism these new lands were divided between the spanish empire and portuguese empire then still between portugal and castile—the crown of castile had a dynastic but not state union with the crown of aragon through the catholic monarchs first by the papal bull inter caetera and then by the treaties of tordesillas and zaragoza
this period is also associated with the commercial revolution the late middle ages saw reforms in accountancy and banking in italy and the eastern mediterranean these ideas were adopted and adapted in western europe to the high risks and rewards associated with colonial ventures
the 17th century saw the creation of the french colonial empire and the dutch empire as well as the english overseas possessions which later became the british empire it also saw the establishment of a danish colonial empire and some swedish overseas colonies
the spread of colonial empires was reduced in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by the american revolutionary war and the latin american wars of independence however many new colonies were established after this time including the german colonial empire and belgian colonial empire in the late 19th century many european powers were involved in the scramble for africa
the russian empire ottoman empire and austrian empire existed at the same time as the above empires but did not expand over oceans rather these empires expanded through the more traditional route of the conquest of neighboring territories there was though some russian colonization of the americas across the bering strait the empire of japan modeled itself on european colonial empires the united states of america gained overseas territories after the spanish–american war for which the term american empire was coined

after the first world war the victorious allies divided up the german colonial empire and much of the ottoman empire between themselves as league of nations mandates these territories were divided into three classes according to how quickly it was deemed that they would be ready for independence
after world war ii decolonization progressed rapidly this was caused by a number of reasons first the japanese victories in the pacific war showed indians and other subject peoples that the colonial powers were not invincible second many colonial powers were significantly weakened by world war ii
dozens of independence movements and global political solidarity projects such as the non-aligned movement were instrumental in the decolonization efforts of former colonies these included significant wars of independence fought in indonesia vietnam algeria and kenya eventually the european powers—pressured by the united states and soviets—resigned themselves to decolonization
in 1962 the united nations set up a special committee on decolonization often called the committee of 24 to encourage this process


 european empires in the 20th century 
the major european empires consisted of the following colonies at the start of world war i former colonies of the spanish empire became independent before 1914 and are not listed former colonies of other european empires that previously became independent such as the former french colony haiti are not listed

the worlds colonial population at the time of the first world war totaled about 560 million people of whom 70% were in british domains 10% in french 9% in dutch 4% in japanese 2% in german 2% in american 2% in portuguese 1% in belgian and 1/2 of 1% in italian possessions the home domains of the colonial powers had a total population of about 370 million peopleasking whether colonies paid economic historian grover clark argues an emphatic no he reports that in every case the support cost especially the military system necessary to support and defend the colonies outran the total trade they produced apart from the british empire they were not favored destinations for the immigration of surplus populations

 numbers of european settlers in the colonies 1500–1914 

by 1914 europeans had migrated to the colonies in the millions some intended to remain in the colonies as temporary settlers mainly as military personnel or on business others went to the colonies as immigrants british people were by far the most numerous population to migrate to the colonies 2.5 million settled in canada 1.5 million in australia 750,000 in new zealand 450,000 in the union of south africa and 200,000 in india french citizens also migrated in large numbers mainly to the colonies in the north african maghreb region 1.3 million settled in algeria 200,000 in morocco 100,000 in tunisia while only 20,000 migrated to french indochina dutch and german colonies saw relatively scarce european migration since dutch and german colonial expansion focused on commercial goals rather than settlement portugal sent 150,000 settlers to angola 80,000 to mozambique and 20,000 to goa during the spanish empire approximately 550,000 spanish settlers migrated to latin america

 neocolonialism 

the term neocolonialism has been used to refer to a variety of contexts since decolonization that took place after world war ii generally it does not refer to a type of direct colonization rather colonialism by other means specifically neocolonialism refers to the theory that former or existing economic relationships such as the general agreement on tariffs and trade and the central american free trade agreement or through companies such as royal dutch shell in nigeria and brunei created by former colonial powers were or are used to maintain control of their former colonies and dependencies after the colonial independence movements of the post–world war ii period


 impact of colonialism and colonization 

the impacts of colonization are immense and pervasive various effects both immediate and protracted include the spread of virulent diseases unequal social relations exploitation enslavement medical advances the creation of new institutions abolitionism improved infrastructure and technological progress colonial practices also spur the spread of colonist languages literature and cultural institutions while endangering or obliterating those of native peoples the native cultures of the colonized peoples can also have a powerful influence on the imperial country


 economy trade and commerce 
economic expansion sometimes described as the colonial surplus has accompanied imperial expansion since ancient times greek trade networks spread throughout the mediterranean region while roman trade expanded with the primary goal of directing tribute from the colonized areas towards the roman metropole according to strabo by the time of emperor augustus up to 120 roman ships would set sail every year from myos hormos in roman egypt to india with the development of trade routes under the ottoman empire

gujari hindus syrian muslims jews armenians christians from south and central europe operated trading routes that supplied persian and arab horses to the armies of all three empires mocha coffee to delhi and belgrade persian silk to india and istanbul
aztec civilization developed into an extensive empire that much like the roman empire had the goal of exacting tribute from the conquered colonial areas for the aztecs a significant tribute was the acquisition of sacrificial victims for their religious ritualson the other hand european colonial empires sometimes attempted to channel restrict and impede trade involving their colonies funneling activity through the metropole and taxing accordingly
despite the general trend of economic expansion the economic performance of former european colonies varies significantly in institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth economists daron acemoglu simon johnson and james a robinson compare the economic influences of the european colonists on different colonies and study what could explain the huge discrepancies in previous european colonies for example between west african colonies like sierra leone and hong kong and singaporeaccording to the paper economic institutions are the determinant of the colonial success because they determine their financial performance and order for the distribution of resources at the same time these institutions are also consequences of political institutions – especially how de facto and de jure political power is allocated to explain the different colonial cases we thus need to look first into the political institutions that shaped the economic institutionsfor example one interesting observation is the reversal of fortune – the less developed civilizations in 1500 like north america australia and new zealand are now much richer than those countries who used to be in the prosperous civilizations in 1500 before the colonists came like the mughals in india and the incas in the americas one explanation offered by the paper focuses on the political institutions of the various colonies it was less likely for european colonists to introduce economic institutions where they could benefit quickly from the extraction of resources in the area therefore given a more developed civilization and denser population european colonists would rather keep the existing economic systems than introduce an entirely new system while in places with little to extract european colonists would rather establish new economic institutions to protect their interests political institutions thus gave rise to different types of economic systems which determined the colonial economic performanceeuropean colonization and development also changed gendered systems of power already in place around the world in many pre-colonialist areas women maintained power prestige or authority through reproductive or agricultural control for example in certain parts of sub-saharan africa women maintained farmland in which they had usage rights while men would make political and communal decisions for a community the women would control the villages food supply or their individual familys land this allowed women to achieve power and autonomy even in patrilineal and patriarchal societiesthrough the rise of european colonialism came a large push for development and industrialization of most economic systems however when working to improve productivity europeans focused mostly on male workers foreign aid arrived in the form of loans land credit and tools to speed up development but were only allocated to men in a more european fashion women were expected to serve on a more domestic level the result was a technologic economic and class-based gender gap that widened over time


 slavery and indentured servitude 

european nations entered their imperial projects with the goal of enriching the european metropole exploitation of non-europeans and other europeans to support imperial goals was acceptable to the colonizers two outgrowths of this imperial agenda were slavery and indentured servitude in the 17th century nearly two-thirds of english settlers came to north america as indentured servantseuropean slave traders brought large numbers of african slaves to the americas by sail spain and portugal had brought african slaves to work at african colonies such as cape verde and the azores and then latin america by the 16th century the british french and dutch joined in the slave trade in subsequent centuries ultimately around 11 million africans were taken to the caribbean and north and south america as slaves by european colonizers

abolitionists in europe and americas protested the inhumane treatment of african slaves which led to the elimination of the slave trade by the late 18th century the labour shortage that resulted inspired european colonizers to develop a new source of labour using a system of indentured servitude indentured servants consented to a contract with the european colonizers under their contract the servant would work for an employer for a term of at least a year while the employer agreed to pay for the servants voyage to the colony possibly pay for the return to the country of origin and pay the employee a wage as well the employee was indentured to the employer because they owed a debt back to the employer for their travel expense to the colony which they were expected to pay through their wages in practice indentured servants were exploited through terrible working conditions and burdensome debts created by the employers with whom the servants had no means of negotiating the debt once they arrived in the colony
india and china were the largest source of indentured servants during the colonial era indentured servants from india travelled to british colonies in asia africa and the caribbean and also to french and portuguese colonies while chinese servants travelled to british and dutch colonies between 1830 and 1930 around 30 million indentured servants migrated from india and 24 million returned to india china sent more indentured servants to european colonies and around the same proportion returned to chinafollowing the scramble for africa an early but secondary focus for most colonial regimes was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade by the end of the colonial period they were mostly successful in this aim though slavery is still very active in africa and the world at large with much the same practices of de facto servility despite legislative prohibition


 military innovation 

imperial expansion follows military conquest in most instances imperial armies therefore have a long history of military innovation in order to gain an advantage over the armies of the people they aim to conquer greeks developed the phalanx system which enabled their military units to present themselves to their enemies as a wall with foot soldiers using shields to cover one another during their advance on the battlefield under philip ii of macedon they were able to organize thousands of soldiers into a formidable battle force bringing together carefully trained infantry and cavalry regiments alexander the great exploited this military foundation further during his conquests
the spanish empire held a major advantage over mesoamerican warriors through the use of weapons made of stronger metal predominantly iron which was able to shatter the blades of axes used by the aztec civilization and others the european development of firearms using gunpowder cemented their military advantage over the peoples they sought to subjugate in the americas and elsewhere


 the end of empire 

the populations of some colonial territories such as canada enjoyed relative peace and prosperity as part of a european power at least among the majority however minority populations such as first nations peoples and french-canadians experienced marginalization and resented colonial practises francophone residents of quebec for example were vocal in opposing conscription into the armed services to fight on behalf of britain during world war i resulting in the conscription crisis of 1917 other european colonies had much more pronounced conflict between european settlers and the local population rebellions broke out in the later decades of the imperial era such as indias sepoy rebellion
the territorial boundaries imposed by european colonizers notably in central africa and south asia defied the existing boundaries of native populations that had previously interacted little with one another european colonizers disregarded native political and cultural animosities imposing peace upon people under their military control native populations were often relocated at the will of the colonial administrators once independence from european control was achieved civil war erupted in some former colonies as native populations fought to capture territory for their own ethnic cultural or political group the partition of india a 1947 civil war that came in the aftermath of indias independence from britain became a conflict with 500,000 killed fighting erupted between hindu sikh and muslim communities as they fought for territorial dominance muslims fought for an independent country to be partitioned where they would not be a religious minority resulting in the creation of pakistan


 post-independence population movement 

in a reversal of the migration patterns experienced during the modern colonial era post-independence era migration followed a route back towards the imperial country in some cases this was a movement of settlers of european origin returning to the land of their birth or to an ancestral birthplace 900,000 french colonists known as the pied-noirs resettled in france following algerias independence in 1962 a significant number of these migrants were also of algerian descent 800,000 people of portuguese origin migrated to portugal after the independence of former colonies in africa between 1974 and 1979 300,000 settlers of dutch origin migrated to the netherlands from the dutch west indies after dutch military control of the colony endedafter wwii 300,000 dutchmen from the dutch east indies of which the majority were people of eurasian descent called indo europeans repatriated to the netherlands a significant number later migrated to the us canada australia and new zealandglobal travel and migration in general developed at an increasingly brisk pace throughout the era of european colonial expansion citizens of the former colonies of european countries may have a privileged status in some respects with regard to immigration rights when settling in the former european imperial nation for example rights to dual citizenship may be generous or larger immigrant quotas may be extended to former colonies
in some cases the former european imperial nations continue to foster close political and economic ties with former colonies the commonwealth of nations is an organization that promotes cooperation between and among britain and its former colonies the commonwealth members a similar organization exists for former colonies of france the francophonie the community of portuguese language countries plays a similar role for former portuguese colonies and the dutch language union is the equivalent for former colonies of the netherlands
migration from former colonies has proven to be problematic for european countries where the majority population may express hostility to ethnic minorities who have immigrated from former colonies cultural and religious conflict have often erupted in france in recent decades between immigrants from the maghreb countries of north africa and the majority population of france nonetheless immigration has changed the ethnic composition of france by the 1980s 25% of the total population of inner paris and 14% of the metropolitan region were of foreign origin mainly algerian


 introduced diseases 

encounters between explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced new diseases which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence for example smallpox measles malaria yellow fever and others were unknown in pre-columbian americadisease killed the entire native guanches population of the canary islands in the 16th century half the native population of hispaniola in 1518 was killed by smallpox smallpox also ravaged mexico in the 1520s killing 150,000 in tenochtitlan alone including the emperor and peru in the 1530s aiding the european conquerors measles killed a further two million mexican natives in the 17th century in 1618–1619 smallpox wiped out 90% of the massachusetts bay native americans smallpox epidemics in 1780–1782 and 1837–1838 brought devastation and drastic depopulation among the plains indians some believe that the death of up to 95% of the native american population of the new world was caused by old world diseases over the centuries the europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases while the indigenous peoples had no time to build such immunitysmallpox decimated the native population of australia killing around 50% of indigenous australians in the early years of british colonisation it also killed many new zealand māori as late as 1848–49 as many as 40,000 out of 150,000 hawaiians are estimated to have died of measles whooping cough and influenza introduced diseases notably smallpox nearly wiped out the native population of easter island in 1875 measles killed over 40,000 fijians approximately one-third of the population the ainu population decreased drastically in the 19th century due in large part
to infectious diseases brought by japanese settlers pouring into hokkaidoconversely researchers have hypothesized that a precursor to syphilis may have been carried from the new world to europe after columbuss voyages the findings suggested europeans could have carried the nonvenereal tropical bacteria home where the organisms may have mutated into a more deadly form in the different conditions of europe the disease was more frequently fatal than it is today syphilis was a major killer in europe during the renaissance the first cholera pandemic began in bengal then spread across india by 1820 ten thousand british troops and countless indians died during this pandemic between 1736 and 1834 only some 10% of east india companys officers survived to take the final voyage home waldemar haffkine who mainly worked in india who developed and used vaccines against cholera and bubonic plague in the 1890s is considered the first microbiologist

as early as 1803 the spanish crown organised a mission the balmis expedition to transport the smallpox vaccine to the spanish colonies and establish mass vaccination programs there by 1832 the federal government of the united states established a smallpox vaccination program for native americans under the direction of mountstuart elphinstone a program was launched to propagate smallpox vaccination in india from the beginning of the 20th century onwards the elimination or control of disease in tropical countries became a driving force for all colonial powers the sleeping sickness epidemic in africa was arrested due to mobile teams systematically screening millions of people at risk in the 20th century the world saw the biggest increase in its population in human history due to lessening of the mortality rate in many countries due to medical advances the world population has grown from 1.6 billion in 1900 to over seven billion today


 colonialism and the history of thought 


 universalism 
the conquest of vast territories brings multitudes of diverse cultures under the central control of the imperial authorities from the time of ancient greece and ancient rome this fact has been addressed by empires adopting the concept of universalism and applying it to their imperial policies towards their subjects far from the imperial capitol the capitol the metropole was the source of ostensibly enlightened policies imposed throughout the distant colonies
the empire that grew from greek conquest particularly by alexander the great spurred the spread of greek language religion science and philosophy throughout the colonies while most greeks considered their own culture superior to all others the word barbarian is derived from mutterings that sounded to greek ears like bar-bar alexander was unique in promoting a campaign to win the hearts and minds of the persians he adopted persian customs of clothing and otherwise encouraged his men to go native by adopting local wives and learning their mannerisms of note is that he radically departed from earlier greek attempts at colonization characterized by the murder and enslavement of the local inhabitants and the settling of greek citizens from the polis
roman universalism was characterized by cultural and religious tolerance and a focus on civil efficiency and the rule of law roman law was imposed on both roman citizens and colonial subjects although imperial rome had no public education latin spread through its use in government and trade roman law prohibited local leaders to wage war between themselves which was responsible for the 200 year long pax romana at the time the longest period of peace in history the roman empire was tolerant of diverse cultures and religious practises even allowing them on a few occasions to threaten roman authority


 colonialism and geography 

settlers acted as the link between indigenous populations and the imperial hegemony thus bridging the geographical ideological and commercial gap between the colonizers and colonized while the extent in which geography as an academic study is implicated in colonialism is contentious geographical tools such as cartography shipbuilding navigation mining and agricultural productivity were instrumental in european colonial expansion colonizers awareness of the earths surface and abundance of practical skills provided colonizers with a knowledge that in turn created poweranne godlewska and neil smith argue that empire was quintessentially a geographical project historical geographical theories such as environmental determinism legitimized colonialism by positing the view that some parts of the world were underdeveloped which created notions of skewed evolution geographers such as ellen churchill semple and ellsworth huntington put forward the notion that northern climates bred vigour and intelligence as opposed to those indigenous to tropical climates see the tropics viz a viz a combination of environmental determinism and social darwinism in their approachpolitical geographers also maintain that colonial behavior was reinforced by the physical mapping of the world therefore creating a visual separation between them and us geographers are primarily focused on the spaces of colonialism and imperialism more specifically the material and symbolic appropriation of space enabling colonialismmaps played an extensive role in colonialism as bassett would put it by providing geographical information in a convenient and standardized format cartographers helped open west africa to european conquest commerce and colonization however because the relationship between colonialism and geography was not scientifically objective cartography was often manipulated during the colonial era social norms and values had an effect on the constructing of maps during colonialism map-makers used rhetoric in their formation of boundaries and in their art the rhetoric favored the view of the conquering europeans this is evident in the fact that any map created by a non-european was instantly regarded as inaccurate furthermore european cartographers were required to follow a set of rules which led to ethnocentrism portraying ones own ethnicity in the center of the map as harley would put it the steps in making a map – selection omission simplification classification the creation of hierarchies and symbolization – are all inherently rhetoricala common practice by the european cartographers of the time was to map unexplored areas as blank spaces this influenced the colonial powers as it sparked competition amongst them to explore and colonize these regions imperialists aggressively and passionately looked forward to filling these spaces for the glory of their respective countries the dictionary of human geography notes that cartography was used to empty undiscovered lands of their indigenous meaning and bring them into spatial existence via the imposition of western place-names and borders therefore priming virgin putatively empty land wilderness for colonization thus sexualizing colonial landscapes as domains of male penetration reconfiguring alien space as absolute quantifiable and separable as propertydavid livingstone stresses that geography has meant different things at different times and in different places and that we should keep an open mind in regards to the relationship between geography and colonialism instead of identifying boundaries geography as a discipline was not and is not an objective science painter and jeffrey argue rather it is based on assumptions about the physical world comparison of exogeographical representations of ostensibly tropical environments in science fiction art support this conjecture finding the notion of the tropics to be an artificial collection of ideas and beliefs that are independent of geography


 colonialism and imperialism 

a colony is a part of an empire and so colonialism is closely related to imperialism assumptions are that colonialism and imperialism are interchangeable however robert j c young suggests that imperialism is the concept while colonialism is the practice colonialism is based on an imperial outlook thereby creating a consequential relationship through an empire colonialism is established and capitalism is expanded on the other hand a capitalist economy naturally enforces an empire in the next section marxists make a case for this mutually reinforcing relationship


 marxist view of colonialism 
marxism views colonialism as a form of capitalism enforcing exploitation and social change marx thought that working within the global capitalist system colonialism is closely associated with uneven development it is an instrument of wholesale destruction dependency and systematic exploitation producing distorted economies socio-psychological disorientation massive poverty and neocolonial dependency colonies are constructed into modes of production the search for raw materials and the current search for new investment opportunities is a result of inter-capitalist rivalry for capital accumulation lenin regarded colonialism as the root cause of imperialism as imperialism was distinguished by monopoly capitalism via colonialism and as lyal s sunga explains vladimir lenin advocated forcefully the principle of self-determination of peoples in his theses on the socialist revolution and the right of nations to self-determination as an integral plank in the programme of socialist internationalism and he quotes lenin who contended that the right of nations to self-determination implies exclusively the right to independence in the political sense the right to free political separation from the oppressor nation specifically this demand for political democracy implies complete freedom to agitate for secession and for a referendum on secession by the seceding nation non russian marxists within the rsfsr and later the ussr like sultan galiev and vasyl shakhrai meanwhile between 1918 and 1923 and then after 1929 considered the soviet regime a renewed version of the russian imperialism and colonialism
in his critique of colonialism in africa the guyanese historian and political activist walter rodney states

the decisiveness of the short period of colonialism and its negative consequences for africa spring mainly from the fact that africa lost power power is the ultimate determinant in human society being basic to the relations within any group and between groups it implies the ability to defend ones interests and if necessary to impose ones will by any means available  when one society finds itself forced to relinquish power entirely to another society that in itself is a form of underdevelopment  during the centuries of pre-colonial trade some control over social political and economic life was retained in africa in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with europeans that little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism colonialism went much further than trade it meant a tendency towards direct appropriation by europeans of the social institutions within africa africans ceased to set indigenous cultural goals and standards and lost full command of training young members of the society those were undoubtedly major steps backwards  colonialism was not merely a system of exploitation but one whose essential purpose was to repatriate the profits to the so-called mother country from an african view-point that amounted to consistent expatriation of surplus produced by african labour out of african resources it meant the development of europe as part of the same dialectical process in which africa was underdevelopedcolonial africa fell within that part of the international capitalist economy from which surplus was drawn to feed the metropolitan sector as seen earlier exploitation of land and labour is essential for human social advance but only on the assumption that the product is made available within the area where the exploitation takes placeaccording to lenin the new imperialism emphasized the transition of capitalism from free trade to a stage of monopoly capitalism to finance capital he states it is connected with the intensification of the struggle for the partition of the world as free trade thrives on exports of commodities monopoly capitalism thrived on the export of capital amassed by profits from banks and industry this to lenin was the highest stage of capitalism he goes on to state that this form of capitalism was doomed for war between the capitalists and the exploited nations with the former inevitably losing war is stated to be the consequence of imperialism as a continuation of this thought gn uzoigwe states but it is now clear from more serious investigations of african history in this period that imperialism was essentially economic in its fundamental impulses


 liberalism capitalism and colonialism 
classical liberals were generally in abstract opposition to colonialism as opposed to colonization and imperialism including adam smith frédéric bastiat richard cobden john bright henry richard herbert spencer hr fox bourne edward morel josephine butler wj fox and william ewart gladstone their philosophies found the colonial enterprise particularly mercantilism in opposition to the principles of free trade and liberal policies adam smith wrote in the wealth of nations that britain should grant independence to all of its colonies and also argued that it would be economically beneficial for british people in the average although the merchants having mercantilist privileges would lose out


 scientific thought in colonialism race and gender 
during the colonial era the global process of colonization served to spread and synthesize the social and political belief systems of the mother-countries which often included a belief in a certain natural racial superiority of the race of the mother-country colonialism also acted to reinforce these same racial belief systems within the mother-countries themselves usually also included within the colonial belief systems was a certain belief in the inherent superiority of male over female however this particular belief was often pre-existing amongst the pre-colonial societies prior to their colonizationpopular political practices of the time reinforced colonial rule by legitimizing european and or japanese male authority and also legitimizing female and non-mother-country race inferiority through studies of craniology comparative anatomy and phrenology biologists naturalists anthropologists and ethnologists of the 19th century were focused on the study of colonized indigenous women as in the case of georges cuviers study of sarah baartman such cases embraced a natural superiority and inferiority relationship between the races based on the observations of naturalists from the mother-countries european studies along these lines gave rise to the perception that african womens anatomy and especially genitalia resembled those of mandrills baboons and monkeys thus differentiating colonized africans from what were viewed as the features of the evolutionarily superior and thus rightfully authoritarian european womanin addition to what would now be viewed as pseudo-scientific studies of race which tended to reinforce a belief in an inherent mother-country racial superiority a new supposedly science-based ideology concerning gender roles also then emerged as an adjunct to the general body of beliefs of inherent superiority of the colonial era female inferiority across all cultures was emerging as an idea supposedly supported by craniology that led scientists to argue that the typical brain size of the female human was on the average slightly smaller than that of the male thus inferring that therefore female humans must be less developed and less evolutionarily advanced than males this finding of relative cranial size difference was later simply attributed to the general typical size difference of the human male body versus that of the typical human female bodywithin the former european colonies non-europeans and women sometimes faced invasive studies by the colonial powers in the interest of the then prevailing pro-colonial scientific ideology of the day such seemingly flawed studies of race and gender coincided with the era of colonialism and the initial introduction of foreign cultures appearances and gender roles into the now gradually widening world-views of the scholars of the mother-countries


 the other 

the other or othering is the process of creating a separate entity to persons or groups who are labelled as different or non-normal due to the repetition of characteristics othering is the creation of those who discriminate to distinguish label categorize those who do not fit in the societal norm several scholars in recent decades developed the notion of the other as an epistemological concept in social theory for example postcolonial scholars believed that colonizing powers explained an other who were there to dominate civilize and extract resources through colonization of landpolitical geographers explain how colonialimperial powers countries groups of people etc othered places they wanted to dominate to legalize their exploitation of the land during and after the rise of colonialism the western powers perceived the east as the other being different and separate from their societal norm this viewpoint and separation of culture had divided the eastern and western culture creating a dominantsubordinate dynamic both being the other towards themselves


 post-colonialism 

post-colonialism or post-colonial theory can refer to a set of theories in philosophy and literature that grapple with the legacy of colonial rule in this sense one can regard post-colonial literature as a branch of postmodern literature concerned with the political and cultural independence of peoples formerly subjugated in colonial empires many practitioners take edward saïds book  orientalism 1978 as the theorys founding work although french theorists such as aimé césaire 1913–2008 and frantz fanon 1925–1961 made similar claims decades before saïd
saïd analyzed the works of balzac baudelaire and lautréamont arguing that they helped to shape a societal fantasy of european racial superiority writers of post-colonial fiction interact with the traditional colonial discourse but modify or subvert it for instance by retelling a familiar story from the perspective of an oppressed minor character in the story gayatri chakravorty spivaks can the subaltern speak 1998 gave its name to subaltern studies
in a critique of postcolonial reason 1999 spivak argued that major works of european metaphysics such as those of  kant and hegel not only tend to exclude the subaltern from their discussions but actively prevent non-europeans from occupying positions as fully human subjects hegels phenomenology of spirit 1807 famous for its explicit ethnocentrism considers  western civilization as the most accomplished of all while kant also had some traces of  racialism in his work


 colonistics 
the field of colonistics studies colonialism from such viewpoints as those of economics sociology and psychology


 effects of colonialism on the colonizers 
in his 1955 essay discourse on colonialism french discours sur le colonialisme french poet aimé césaire evaluates the effects of racist sexist and capitalist attitudes and motivations on the civilizations that attempted to colonize other civilizations in explaining his position he says i admit that it is a good thing to place different civilizations in contact with each other that it is an excellent thing to blend different worlds that whatever its own particular genius may be a civilization that withdraws into itself atrophies that for civilizations exchange is oxygen however he contends that colonization is a harmful and counterproductive means of interacting with and learning from neighboring civilizations
to illustrate his point he explains that colonization relies on racist and xenophobic frameworks that dehumanize the targets of colonization and justify their extreme and brutal mistreatment every time an immoral act perpetrated by colonizers onto the colonized is justified by racist sexist otherwise xenophobic or capitalist motivations to subjugate a group of people the colonizing civilization acquires another dead weight a universal regression takes place a gangrene sets in a center of infection begins to spread  césaire argues the result of this process is that a poison is instilled into the veins of europe and slowly but surely the continent proceeds toward savagery   césaire is indicating that the racist and xenophobic justifications for colonization—motivated by capitalist desires—ultimately result in the moral and cultural degradation of the colonizing nation thusly colonization is damaging to the civilizations that participate as perpetrators in a way that is internally harmful


 british public opinion about the british empire 
the 2014 yougov survey found that british people are mostly proud of colonialism and the british empire
a new yougov survey finds that most think the british empire is more something to be proud of 59 rather than ashamed of 19 23% dont know young people are least likely to feel pride over shame when it comes to the empire though about half 48 of 18–24 year olds do in comparison about two-thirds 65 of over 60s feel mostly proud  a third of british people 34 also say they would like it if britain still had an empire under half 45 say they would not like the empire to exist today 20% dont know
