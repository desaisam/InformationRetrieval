institute of space and astronautical science 宇宙科学研究所 uchū kagaku kenkyūjo isas is a japanese national research organization of astrophysics using rockets astronomical satellites and interplanetary probes which played a major role in japans space development  since 2003 it is a division of japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa


 history 
the isas originated as part of the institute of industrial science of the university of tokyo where hideo itokawa experimented with miniature solid-fuel rockets pencil rocket and baby rocket in the 1950s  this experimentation eventually led to the development of the κ kappa sounding rocket which was used for observations during the international geophysical year  by 1960 the κ-8 rocket had reached an altitude of 200 km
in 1964 the rocket group and the institute of aeronautics along with scientific ballooning team were merged to form institute of space and aeronautical science 宇宙航空研究所 uchū kōkū kenkyūjo within the university of tokyo  the rocket evolved into the l lambda series and in 1970 l-4s-5 was launched as japans first artificial satellite ohsumi
although lambda rockets were only sounding rockets the next generation of m mu rockets was intended to be satellite launch vehicles from the start  beginning in 1971 isas launched a series of scientific satellites to observe the ionosphere and magnetosphere  since the launch of hakucho in 1979 isas has had x-ray astronomy satellites consecutively in orbit until it was briefly terminated by the launch failure of astro-e
in 1981 as a part of university system reform and for the mission expansion isas was spun out from university of tokyo as an inter-university national research organization institute of space and astronautical science
in 2003 three national aerospace organizations including isas were merged to form japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa  the english name institute of space and astronautical science is still used although the japanese name was changed to 宇宙科学研究本部 literally space science research division whereas the previous names literal translation was space science laboratory  in 2010 the name was changed back to the previous uchū kagaku kenkyūjo 宇宙科学研究所
