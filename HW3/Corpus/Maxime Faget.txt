maxime allen max faget pronounced fah-zhay august 26 1921 – october 9 2004 was a belizean-born american mechanical engineer faget was the designer of the mercury spacecraft and contributed to the later gemini and apollo spacecraft as well as the space shuttle


 life 
faget was the son of american doctor guy henry faget and great-grandson of another prominent physician jean charles faget born in stann creek town belize then known as british honduras faget attended city college of san francisco in san francisco california and he received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from louisiana state university in 1943after three years as a submariner aboard uss guavina in the us navy he joined the langley research center in hampton virginia as a research scientist while working for naca at langley faget worked on the design of the x-15 hypersonic spacecraftin 1958 faget became one of the 35 engineers who formed the space task group creating the mercury spacecraft faget based his designs on the aerodynamic work of harvey allen from the mid-1950s and was instrumental in selecting the blunt-body shape that won the mercury competition over numerous contenders faget also led the development of the escape tower system used on mercury which was used in various forms on almost all following manned spacecraft faget also worked on the gemini and apollo vehicles which shared many design points with the mercuryfaget filed a patent for a space shuttle vehicle design in 1972 his design which he named dc-3 in homage to the famed douglas dc-3 airliner was a small two-stage fully reusable shuttle with a payload capacity around 15,000 pounds 6,800 kg dc-3 was officially studied by north american aviation and shown in the press as a baseline contender for the space transportation system sts north american also studied a version of the same basic system with a much larger 50,000 pounds 23,000 kg payload however the dc-3s nose-high re-entry profile was controversial and eventually doomed it when the us air force joined the shuttle program and demanded cross-range performance that the dc-3 simply couldnt meet in the end its most lasting contribution was to clearly identify the trade-offs inherent in any reusable designin 1962 he became the director of engineering and development at the manned spacecraft center and continued to work for nasa until his retirement in 1981 shortly after the second space shuttle flight sts-2 after his retirement faget was among the founders of space industries inc established in 1982 one of the projects of the company was the wake shield facility a device to create near-perfect vacuum in the thermosphere the wsf flew three times with a space shuttle in 1994–96 sts-60 sts-69 sts-80
faget was inducted into the international space hall of fame in 1969 the national inventors hall of fame and received the nasa outstanding leadership medal and john j montgomery award
faget died of bladder cancer on october 9 2004 aged 83
