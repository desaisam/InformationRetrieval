the following table is a partial list of artificial objects on the surface of mars consisting of spacecraft which were launched from earth most are defunct after having served their purpose but the curiosity rover and the insight lander are still operational as of 2018 insight is the most recent artificial object to land safely on mars the table does not include smaller objects such as springs fragments parachutes and heat shields as of november 5 2016 there are about 14 spacecraft missions on the surface of mars some of these missions have multiple spacecraft


 legend 


 table of objects 
in this listing it is implied that each mission left debris according to its design for example the schiaparelli edm lander likely exploded on impact creating an unknown number of fragments at one location at another location there may be a lower heat shield and at another location a parachute and upper heat shield another example is the counterweights ejected by msl during its descent in some cases the nature and location of this additional debris has been determined and in other cases even the location of the main spacecraft has remained unknown the identification of beagle 2 after 11 years is one of the greatest breakthroughs yet since prior to that it could not be confirmed what had happened spacecraft that have not been precisely located include mars 2 mars 3 mars 6 mars polar lander and the two deep space 2 probes

orbiters whose orbit could eventually decay and impact the surface include viking 1 and viking 2 orbiters mro 2001 mars odyssey mars express mars global surveyor phobos 2 mars 2 mars 3 and mars 5 orbiters and mariner 9 see also list of mars orbiters
mariner 9 which entered mars orbit in 1971 is expected to remain in orbit until approximately 2022 when the spacecraft is projected to enter the martian atmosphere and either burn up or crash into the planets surface
