sweden swedish sverige ˈsværjɛ listen formally the kingdom of sweden swedish konungariket sverige  is a scandinavian nordic country in northern europe it borders norway to the west and north and finland to the east and is connected to denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the öresund a strait at the swedish-danish border at 450,295 square kilometres 173,860 sq mi sweden is the largest country in northern europe the third-largest country in the european union and the fifth largest country in europe by area sweden has a total population of 10.2 million of which 2.4 million has a foreign background it has a low population density of 22 inhabitants per square kilometre 57sq mi the highest concentration is in the southern half of the country
germanic peoples have inhabited sweden since prehistoric times emerging into history as the geats swedish götar and swedes svear and constituting the sea peoples known as the norsemen southern sweden is predominantly agricultural while the north is heavily forested sweden is part of the geographical area of fennoscandia the climate is in general very mild for its northerly latitude due to significant maritime influence that in spite of this still retains warm continental summers today  the sovereign state of sweden is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy with a monarch as head of state like its neighbour norway the capital city is stockholm which is also the most populous city in the country legislative power is vested in the 349-member unicameral riksdag executive power is exercised by the government chaired by the prime minister sweden is a unitary state currently divided into 21 counties and 290 municipalities
an independent swedish state emerged during the early 12th century after the black death in the middle of the 14th century killed about a third of the scandinavian population the hanseatic league threatened scandinavias culture finances and languages this led to the forming of the scandinavian kalmar union in 1397 which sweden left in 1523 when sweden became involved in the thirty years war on the reformist side an expansion of its territories began and eventually the swedish empire was formed this became one of the great powers of europe until the early 18th century swedish territories outside the scandinavian peninsula were gradually lost during the 18th and 19th centuries ending with the annexation of present-day finland by russia in 1809 the last war in which sweden was directly involved was in 1814 when norway was militarily forced into personal union since then sweden has been at peace maintaining an official policy of neutrality in foreign affairs the union with norway was peacefully dissolved in 1905 sweden was formally neutral through both world wars and the cold war albeit sweden has since 2009 openly moved towards cooperation with nato
after the end of the cold war sweden joined the european union eu on 1 january 1995 but declined nato membership as well as eurozone ez membership following a referendum it is also a member of the united nations the nordic council the council of europe the world trade organization and the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd sweden maintains a nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens it has the worlds eleventh-highest per capita income and ranks highly in numerous metrics of national performance including quality of life health education protection of civil liberties economic competitiveness equality prosperity and human development


 etymology 

the name sweden was loaned from dutch in the 17th century to refer to sweden as an emerging great power before swedens imperial expansion early modern english used swedeland sweden is derived through back-formation from old english swēoþēod which meant people of the swedes old norse svíþjóð latin suetidi this word is derived from sweonsweonas old norse sviar latin suiones the swedish name sverige a compound of the words svea and rike with lenition of the consonant k first recorded in the cognate swēorice in beowulf literally means realm of the swedes excluding the geats in götaland
variations of the name sweden are used in most languages with the exception of danish and norwegian using sverige faroese svøríki icelandic svíþjóð and the more notable exception of some finnic languages where ruotsi finnish and rootsi estonian are used names commonly considered as referring to the people from the coastal areas of roslagen uppland who were known as the rus and through them etymologically related to the english name for russia
the etymology of swedes and thus sweden is generally not agreed upon but may derive from proto-germanic swihoniz meaning ones own referring to ones own germanic tribe


 history 


 prehistory 

swedens prehistory begins in the allerød oscillation a warm period around 12,000 bc with late palaeolithic reindeer-hunting camps of the bromme culture at the edge of the ice in what is now the countrys southernmost province scania this period was characterised by small bands of hunter-gatherer-fishers using flint technology
sweden is first described in a written source in germania by tacitus in 98 ad in germania 44 and 45 he mentions the swedes suiones as a powerful tribe distinguished not merely for their arms and men but for their powerful fleets with ships that had a prow at each end longships which kings kuningaz ruled these suiones is unknown but norse mythology presents a long line of legendary and semi-legendary kings going back to the last centuries bc as for literacy in sweden itself the runic script was in use among the south scandinavian elite by at least the 2nd century ad but all that has come down to the present from the roman period is curt inscriptions on artefacts mainly of male names demonstrating that the people of south scandinavia spoke proto-norse at the time a language ancestral to swedish and other north germanic languagesin the 6th century jordanes names two tribes living in scandza both of which are now considered to be synonymous with the swedes the suetidi and suehans suetidi is considered to be the latin form of svíþjóð the old norse name for the swedes jordanes describes the suetidi and dani as being of the same stock and the tallest of people he later mentions other scandinavian tribes as being of a same stature the suehans were known to the roman world as suppliers of black fox skins and according to jordanes had very fine horses similar to those of the thyringi of germania alia vero gens ibi moratur suehans quae velud thyringi equis utuntur eximiis the icelandic historian snorri sturluson also wrote that the swedish king adils eadgils had the finest horses of his day


 the vikings 

the swedish viking age lasted roughly from the 8th century to the 11th century it is believed that swedish vikings and gutar mainly travelled east and south going to finland the baltic countries russia belarus ukraine the black sea and even as far as baghdad their routes passed through the dnieper south to constantinople on which they carried out numerous raids the byzantine emperor theophilos noticed their great skills in war and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard known as the varangian guard the swedish vikings called rus are believed to be the founding fathers of kievan rus the arab traveller ibn fadlan described these vikings as follows

i have seen the rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the itil i have never seen more perfect physical specimens tall as date palms blond and ruddy they wear neither tunics nor caftans but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free each man has an axe a sword and a knife and keeps each by him at all times the swords are broad and grooved of frankish sort
the actions of these swedish vikings are commemorated on many runestones in sweden such as the greece runestones and the varangian runestones there was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards which are commemorated on stones such as the england runestones the last major swedish viking expedition appears to have been the ill-fated expedition of ingvar the far-travelled to serkland the region south-east of the caspian sea its members are commemorated on the ingvar runestones none of which mentions any survivor what happened to the crew is unknown but it is believed that they died of sickness


 the kingdom of sweden 
it is not known when and how the kingdom of sweden was born but the list of swedish monarchs is drawn from the first kings known to have ruled both svealand sweden and götaland gothia as one province beginning with eric the victorious sweden and gothia were two separate nations long before that and since antiquity it is not known how long they existed the epic poem beowulf describes semi-legendary swedish-geatish wars in the 6th century götaland in this sense mainly includes the provinces of östergötland east gothia and västergötland west gothia the island of gotland was disputed by other than swedes at this time danish hanseatic and gotland-domestic småland was at that time of little interest to anyone due to the deep pine forests and only the city of kalmar with its castle was of importance the south-west parts of the scandinavian peninsula consisted of three danish provinces scania blekinge and halland north of halland denmark had a direct border to norway and its province bohuslän but there were swedish settlements along the southern coastline of norrland

during the early stages of the scandinavian viking age ystad in the danish province scania and paviken on gotland were flourishing centres of trade but they were not parts of the early swedish kingdom remains of what is believed to have been a large market dating from 600 to 700 ad have been found in ystad in paviken an important centre of trade in the baltic region during the 9th and 10th century remains have been found of a large viking age harbour with shipbuilding yards and handicraft industries between 800 and 1000 trade brought an abundance of silver to gotland and according to some scholars the gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of scandinavia combinedst ansgar is usually credited with introducing christianity in 829 but the new religion did not begin to fully replace paganism until the 12th century during the 11th century christianity became the prevalent religion and from 1050 sweden is counted as a christian nation the period between 1100 and 1400 was characterised by internal power struggles and competition among the nordic kingdoms in the years 1150–1293 according to the legend of eric ix and the eric chronicles swedish kings made a first second and third crusade to pagan finland against finns tavastians and karelians and started conflicts with the rus who no longer had any connection with sweden the swedish colonisation of the coastal areas of finland started also during the 12th and 13th century in the 14th century the swedish colonisation of coastal areas of finland began to be more organised and in the end of the century several of the coastal areas of finland were inhabited mostly by swedesexcept for the provinces of scania blekinge and halland in the south-west of the scandinavian peninsula which were parts of the kingdom of denmark during this time feudalism never developed in sweden as it did in the rest of europe the peasantry therefore remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of swedish history slavery also called thralldom was not common in sweden and what slavery there was tended to be driven out of existence thanks to the spread of christianity as well as to the difficulty to obtain slaves from the lands east of the baltic sea and by the development of cities before the 16th century indeed both slavery and serfdom were abolished altogether by a decree of king magnus iv in 1335 former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry and some became labourers in the towns still sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the primary means of exchange for instance the farmers of the province of dalsland would transport their butter to the mining districts of sweden and exchange it there for iron which they would then take to the coast and trade for fish which they consumed while the iron would be shipped abroad

in the middle of the 14th century sweden was struck by the black death the population of sweden and most of europe was seriously decimated the population at same territory did not reach the numbers of the year 1348 again until the beginning of the 19th century one third of the population died in the triennium of 1349–1351 during this period the swedish cities began to acquire greater rights and were strongly influenced by german merchants of the hanseatic league active especially at visby in 1319 sweden and norway were united under king magnus eriksson and in 1397 queen margaret i of denmark effected the personal union of sweden norway and denmark through the kalmar union however margarets successors whose rule was also centred in denmark were unable to control the swedish nobility
many times the swedish crown was inherited by children kings over the course of the kingdoms existence consequently real power was held for long periods by regents notably those of the sture family chosen by the swedish parliament king christian ii of denmark who asserted his claim to sweden by force of arms ordered a massacre of swedish nobles in stockholm in 1520 this came to be known as the stockholm blood bath and stirred the swedish nobility to new resistance and on 6 june now swedens national holiday in 1523 they made gustav vasa their king this is sometimes considered as the foundation of modern sweden shortly afterwards the new king rejected catholicism and led sweden into the protestant reformation
the hanseatic league had been officially formed at lübeck on the baltic coast of northern germany in 1356 the league sought civil and commercial privileges from the princes and royalty of the countries and cities along the coasts of the baltic sea in exchange they offered a certain amount of protection to the joining cities having their own navy the hansa were able to sweep the baltic sea free of pirates the privileges obtained by the hansa included assurances that only hansa citizens would be allowed to trade from the ports where they were located they sought agreement to be free of all customs and taxes with these concessions lübeck merchants flocked to stockholm where they soon came to dominate the citys economic life and made the port city of stockholm into the leading commercial and industrial city of sweden under the hanseatic trade two-thirds of stockholms imports consisted of textiles while the remaining third was salt the main exports from sweden were iron and copperhowever the swedes began to resent the monopoly trading position of the hansa mostly consisting of german citizens and to resent the income they felt they lost to the hansa consequently when gustav vasa or gustav i broke the monopoly power of the hanseatic league he was regarded as a hero by the swedish people history now views gustav i as the father of the modern swedish nation the foundations laid by gustav would take time to develop furthermore when sweden did develop freed itself from the hanseatic league and entered its golden era the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal landowning class


 swedish empire 

during the 17th century sweden emerged as a european great power before the emergence of the swedish empire sweden was a poor and scarcely populated country on the fringe of european civilisation with no significant power or reputation sweden rose to prominence on a continental scale during the tenure of king gustavus adolphus seizing territories from russia and poland–lithuania in multiple conflicts including the thirty years war
during the thirty years war sweden conquered approximately half of the holy roman states gustav adolphus planned to become the new holy roman emperor ruling over a united scandinavia and the holy roman states but he died at the battle of lützen in 1632 after the battle of nördlingen swedens only significant military defeat of the war pro-swedish sentiment among the german states faded these german provinces excluded themselves from swedish power one by one leaving sweden with only a few northern german territories swedish pomerania bremen-verden and wismar

in the middle of the 17th century sweden was the third-largest country in europe by land area only surpassed by russia and spain sweden reached its largest territorial extent under the rule of charles x after the treaty of roskilde in 1658 the foundation of swedens success during this period is credited to gustav is major changes to the swedish economy in the 16th century and his introduction of protestantism in the 17th century sweden was engaged in many wars for example with the polish–lithuanian commonwealth with both sides competing for territories of todays baltic states with the disastrous battle of kircholm being one of the highlights one-third of the finnish population died in the devastating famine that struck the country in 1696 famine also hit sweden killing roughly 10% of swedens populationthe swedes conducted a series of invasions into the polish–lithuanian commonwealth known as the deluge after more than half a century of almost constant warfare the swedish economy had deteriorated it became the lifetime task of charles son charles xi to rebuild the economy and refit the army his legacy to his son the coming ruler of sweden charles xii was one of the finest arsenals in the world a large standing army and a great fleet swedens largest threat at this time russia had a larger army but was far behind in both equipment and training
after the battle of narva in 1700 one of the first battles of the great northern war the russian army was so severely devastated that sweden had an open chance to invade russia however charles did not pursue the russian army instead turning against poland–lithuania and defeating the polish king augustus ii and his saxon allies at the battle of klissow in 1702 this gave russia time to rebuild and modernise its army
after the success of invading poland charles decided to make an attempt at invading russia but this ended in a decisive russian victory at the battle of poltava in 1709 after a long march exposed to cossack raids the russian tsar peter the greats scorched-earth techniques and the extremely cold winter of 1709 the swedes stood weakened with a shattered morale and were enormously outnumbered against the russian army at poltava the defeat meant the beginning of the end for the swedish empire in addition the plague raging in east central europe devastated the swedish dominions and reached central sweden in 1710
charles xii attempted to invade norway in 1716 but he was shot dead at fredriksten fortress in 1718 the swedes were not militarily defeated at fredriksten but the whole structure and organisation of the campaign fell apart with the kings death and the army withdrew
forced to cede large areas of land in the treaty of nystad in 1721 sweden also lost its place as an empire and as the dominant state on the baltic sea with swedens lost influence russia emerged as an empire and became one of europes dominant nations as the war finally ended in 1721 sweden had lost an estimated 200,000 men 150,000 of those from the area of present-day sweden and 50,000 from the finnish part of swedenin the 18th century sweden did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside scandinavia and most of them were lost culminating with the loss in 1809 of eastern sweden to russia which became the highly autonomous grand principality of finland in imperial russia
in interest of re-establishing swedish dominance in the baltic sea sweden allied itself against its traditional ally and benefactor france in the napoleonic wars swedens role in the battle of leipzig gave it the authority to force denmark–norway an ally of france to cede norway to the king of sweden on 14 january 1814 in exchange for northern german provinces at the treaty of kiel the norwegian attempts to keep their status as a sovereign state were rejected by the swedish king charles xiii he launched a military campaign against norway on 27 july 1814 ending in the convention of moss which forced norway into a personal union with sweden under the swedish crown which lasted until 1905 the 1814 campaign was the last time sweden was at war


 modern history 

the swedish east india company ostindiska kompaniet began in 1731 the obvious choice of home port was gothenburg at swedens west coast the mouth of göta älv river is very wide and has the countys largest and best harbour for high seas journeys the trade continued into the 19th century and caused the little town to become swedens second city
there was a significant population increase during the 18th and 19th centuries which the writer esaias tegnér in 1833 attributed to the peace the smallpox vaccine and the potatoes between 1750 and 1850 the population in sweden doubled according to some scholars mass emigration to america became the only way to prevent famine and rebellion over 1% of the population emigrated annually during the 1880s nevertheless sweden remained poor retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as denmark and western european countries began to industrialise

many looked towards america for a better life during this time it is thought that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million swedes moved to the united states in the early 20th century more swedes lived in chicago than in gothenburg swedens second largest city most swedish immigrants moved to the midwestern united states with a large population in minnesota with a few others moving to other parts of the united states and canada
despite the slow rate of industrialisation into the 19th century many important changes were taking place in the agrarian economy due to constant innovations and a rapid population growth these innovations included government-sponsored programmes of enclosure aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands and the introduction of new crops such as the potato because the swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in europe the swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in swedish politics which has continued through modern times with modern agrarian party now called the centre party between 1870 and 1914 sweden began developing the industrialised economy that exists todaystrong grassroots movements sprung up in sweden during the latter half of the 19th century trade unions temperance groups and independent religious groups creating a strong foundation of democratic principles in 1889 the swedish social democratic party was founded these movements precipitated swedens migration into a modern parliamentary democracy achieved by the time of world war i as the industrial revolution progressed during the 20th century people gradually moved into cities to work in factories and became involved in socialist unions a communist revolution was avoided in 1917 following the re-introduction of parliamentarism and the country was democratised


 world war i and world war ii 

sweden was officially neutral during world war i although under german pressure they did take steps which were detrimental to the allied powers including mining the øresund channel thus closing it to allied shipping and allowing the germans to use swedish facilities and the swedish cipher to transmit secret messages to their overseas embassies sweden also allowed volunteers to fight for the white guards alongside the germans against the red guards and russians in the finnish civil war and briefly occupied the åland islands in co-operation with germany

as in the first world war sweden remained officially neutral during world war ii although its neutrality during world war ii has been disputed sweden was under german influence for much of the war as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades the swedish government felt that it was in no position to openly contest germany and therefore made some concessions sweden also supplied steel and machined parts to germany throughout the war the swedish government unofficially supported finland in the winter war and the continuation war by allowing volunteers and materiel to be shipped to finland however sweden supported norwegian resistance against germany and in 1943 helped rescue danish jews from deportation to nazi concentration camps
during the last year of the war sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts and many refugees among them several thousand jews from nazi-occupied europe were rescued thanks to the swedish rescue missions to internment camps and partly because sweden served as a haven for refugees primarily from the nordic countries and the baltic states the swedish diplomat raoul wallenberg and his colleagues ensured the safety of tens of thousands of hungarian jews nevertheless both swedes and others have argued that sweden could have done more to oppose the nazis war efforts even if it meant increasing the risk of occupation


 post-war era 

sweden was officially a neutral country and remained outside nato and warsaw pact membership during the cold war but privately swedens leadership had strong ties with the united states and other western governments following the war sweden took advantage of an intact industrial base social stability and its natural resources to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of europe sweden received aid under the marshall plan and participated in the oecd during most of the post-war era the country was governed by the swedish social democratic party largely in co-operation with trade unions and industry the government actively pursued an internationally competitive manufacturing sector of primarily large corporationssweden was one of the founding states of the european free trade area efta during the 1960s the efta countries were often referred to as the outer seven as opposed to the inner six of the then-european economic community eecsweden like many industrialised countries entered a period of economic decline and upheaval following the oil embargoes of 1973–74 and 1978–79 in the 1980s several key swedish industries were significantly restructured shipbuilding was discontinued wood pulp was integrated into modernised paper production the steel industry was concentrated and specialised and mechanical engineering was robotisedbetween 1970 and 1990 the overall tax burden rose by over 10 and the growth was low compared to other countries in western europe eventually government began to spend over half of the countrys gross domestic product sweden gdp per capita ranking declined during this time


 recent history 

a bursting real estate bubble caused by inadequate controls on lending combined with an international recession and a policy switch from anti-unemployment policies to anti-inflationary policies resulted in a fiscal crisis in the early 1990s swedens gdp declined by around 5 in 1992 a run on the currency caused the central bank to briefly increase interest rates to 500the response of the government was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve swedens competitiveness among them reducing the welfare state and privatising public services and goods much of the political establishment promoted eu membership and a referendum passed with 52.3% in favour of joining the eu on 13 november 1994 sweden joined the european union on 1 january 1995 in a 2003 referendum the swedish electorate voted against the country joining the euro currency in 2006 sweden got its first majority government for decades as the centre-right alliance defeated the incumbent social democrat government following the rapid growth of support for the anti-immigration sweden democrats and their entrance to the riksdag in 2010 the alliance became a minority cabinet
sweden remains non-aligned militarily although it participates in some joint military exercises with nato and some other countries in addition to extensive co-operation with other european countries in the area of defence technology and defence industry among others swedish companies export weapons that were used by the american military in iraq sweden also has a long history of participating in international military operations including afghanistan where swedish troops are under nato command and in eu sponsored peacekeeping operations in kosovo bosnia and herzegovina and cyprus sweden also participated in enforcing a un mandated no-fly zone over libya during the arab spring sweden held the chair of the european union from 1 july to 31 december 2009
in recent decades sweden has become a more culturally diverse nation due to significant immigration in 2013 it was estimated that 15 per cent of the population was foreign-born and an additional 5 per cent of the population were born to two immigrant parents the influx of immigrants has brought new social challenges violent incidents have periodically occurred including the 2013 stockholm riots which broke out following the police shooting of an elderly portuguese immigrant in response to these violent events the anti-immigration opposition party the swedish democrats promoted their anti-immigration policies while the left-wing opposition blamed growing inequality caused by the centre-right governments socioeconomic policiesin 2014 stefan löfven social democrats won the general election and became the new swedish prime minister the sweden democrats held the balance of power and voted the governments budget down in the riksdag but due to agreements between the government and the alliance the government was able to hang onto power sweden was heavily affected by the 2015 european migrant crisis eventually forcing the government to tighten regulations of entry to the country as sweden received thousands of asylum seekers and migrants predominantly from africa and the middle east per week in autumn overwhelming existing structures


 geography 

situated in northern europe sweden lies west of the baltic sea and gulf of bothnia providing a long coastline and forms the eastern part of the scandinavian peninsula to the west is the scandinavian mountain chain skanderna a range that separates sweden from norway finland is located to its north-east it has maritime borders with denmark germany poland russia lithuania latvia and estonia and it is also linked to denmark south-west by the öresund bridge its border with norway 1,619 km long is the longest uninterrupted border within europe
sweden lies between latitudes 55° and 70° n and mostly between longitudes 11° and 25° e part of stora drammen island is just west of 11°

at 449,964 km2 173,732 sq mi sweden is the 55th-largest country in the world the 4th-largest country entirely in europe and the largest in northern europe the lowest elevation in sweden is in the bay of lake hammarsjön near kristianstad at −2.41 m −7.91 ft below sea level the highest point is kebnekaise at 2,111 m 6,926 ft above sea level
sweden has 25 provinces or landskap based on culture geography and history while these provinces serve no political or administrative purpose they play an important role in peoples self-identity the provinces are usually grouped together in three large lands parts the northern norrland the central svealand and southern götaland the sparsely populated norrland encompasses almost 60% of the country sweden also has the vindelfjällen nature reserve one of the largest protected areas in europe totaling 562,772 ha approx 5,628 km2
about 15% of sweden lies north of the arctic circle southern sweden is predominantly agricultural with increasing forest coverage northward around 65% of swedens total land area is covered with forests the highest population density is in the öresund region in southern sweden along the western coast up to central bohuslän and in the valley of lake mälaren and stockholm gotland and öland are swedens largest islands vänern and vättern are its largest lakes vänern is the third largest in europe after lake ladoga and lake onega in russia combined with the third and fourth largest lakes mälaren and hjälmaren these lakes take up a significant part of the southern swedens area swedens extensive waterway availability throughout the south was exploited with the building of the göta canal in the 19th century shortening the potential distance between the baltic sea south of norrköping and gothenburg by using the lake and river network to facilitate the canal


 climate 

most of sweden has a temperate climate despite its northern latitude with largely four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year the winter in the far south is usually weak and is only manifested through some shorter periods with snow and sub-zero temperatures autumn may well turn into spring there without a distinct period of winter the country can be divided into three types of climate the southernmost part has an oceanic climate the central part has a humid continental climate and the northernmost part has a subarctic climate
however sweden is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude and even somewhat farther south mainly because of the combination of the gulf stream and the general west wind drift caused by the direction of planet earths rotation continental west-coasts to which all of scandinavia belongs as the westernmost part of the eurasian continent are notably warmer than continental east-coasts this can also be seen by comparing eg the canadian cities of vancouver and halifax nova scotia with each other the winter in west coast vancouver is much milder also for example central and southern sweden has much milder winters than many parts of russia canada and the northern united states because of its high latitude the length of daylight varies greatly north of the arctic circle the sun never sets for part of each summer and it never rises for part of each winter in the capital stockholm daylight lasts for more than 18 hours in late june but only around 6 hours in late december sweden receives between 1,100 and 1,900 hours of sunshine annually during july there is not much difference in temperature between the north and south of the country with the exception of in the mountains the whole country has a july-average temperature within the range of 15.0 c to  17.5 c a difference of 2.5 degrees while the january-average temperatures vary from freezing point down to below −15 c along the border with finland a difference of 15 degrees

the highest temperature ever recorded in sweden was 38 °c 100 °f in målilla in 1947 while the coldest temperature ever recorded was −52.6 °c −62.7 °f in vuoggatjålme in 1966 temperatures expected in sweden are heavily influenced by the large fennoscandian landmass as well as continental europe and western russia which allows hot or cool inland air to be easily transported to sweden that in turn renders most of swedens southern areas having warmer summers than almost everywhere in the nearby british isles even matching temperatures found along the continental atlantic coast as far south as in northern spain in winter however the same high-pressure systems sometimes puts the entire country far below freezing temperatures there is some maritime moderation from the atlantic which renders the swedish continental climate less severe than that of nearby russia even though temperature patterns differ between north and south the summer climate is surprisingly similar all through the entire country in spite of the large latitudal differences this is due to the south being surrounded by a greater mass of water with the wider baltic sea and the atlantic air passing over lowland areas from the south-west
apart from the ice-free atlantic bringing marine air into sweden tempering winters the mildness is further explained by prevailing low-pressure systems postponing winter with the long nights often staying above freezing in the south of the country due to the abundant cloud cover by the time winter finally breaks through daylight hours rise quickly ensuring that daytime temperatures soar quickly in spring with the greater number of clear nights frosts remain commonplace quite far south as late as april the cold winters occur when low-pressure systems are weaker an example is that the coldest ever month january 1987 in stockholm was also the sunniest january month on recordthe relative strength of low and high-pressure systems of marine and continental air also define the highly variable summers when hot continental air hits the country the long days and short nights frequently bring temperatures up to 30 °c 86 °f or above even in coastal areas nights normally remain cool especially in inland areas coastal areas can see so-called tropical nights above 20 °c 68 °f occur due to the moderating sea influence during warmer summers summers can be cool especially in the north of the country transitional seasons are normally quite extensive and the four-season climate applies to most of swedens territory except in scania where some years do not record a meteorological winter see table below or in the high lapland mountains where polar microclimates exist
on average most of sweden receives between 500 and 800 mm 20 and 31 in of precipitation each year making it considerably drier than the global average the south-western part of the country receives more precipitation between 1,000 and 1,200 mm 39 and 47 in and some mountain areas in the north are estimated to receive up to 2,000 mm 79 in despite northerly locations southern and central sweden may have almost no snow in some winters most of sweden is located in the rain shadow of the scandinavian mountains through norway and north-west sweden the blocking of cool and wet air in summer as well as the greater landmass leads to warm and dry summers far north in the country with quite warm summers at the bothnia bay coast at 65 degrees latitude which is unheard of elsewhere in the world at such northerly coastlines
swedish meteorological institute smhis monthly average temperatures of some of their weather stations – for the latest scientific full prefixed thirty-year period 1961–1990
next will be presented in year 2020 the weather stations are sorted from south towards north by their numbers


 vegetation 

sweden has a considerable south to north distance stretching between the latitudes n 552013 and n 690336 which causes large climatic difference especially during the winter the related matter of the length and strength of the four seasons plays a role in which plants that naturally can grow at various places sweden is divided in five major vegetation zones these are

the southern deciduous forest zone
the southern coniferous forest zone
the northern coniferous forest zone or the taiga

southern deciduous forest zonealso known as the nemoral region the southern deciduous forest zone is a part of a larger vegetation zone which also includes denmark and large parts of central europe it has to a rather large degree become agricultural areas but larger and smaller forests still exist the region is characterised by a large wealth of trees and shrubs the beech are the most dominant tree but oak can also form smaller forests elm at one time formed forests but have been heavily reduced due to dutch elm disease other important trees and shrubs in this zone include hornbeam elder hazel fly honeysuckle linden lime spindle yew alder buckthorn blackthorn aspen european rowan swedish whitebeam juniper european holly ivy dogwood goat willow larch bird cherry wild cherry maple ash alder along creeks and in sandy soil birch compete with pine spruce is not native but between approximately 1870 and 1980 large areas were planted with it they tend to grow too quickly due to being outside of their native range and large distances between the tree rings cause poor board quality later some spruce trees began to die before reaching optimal height and many more of the coniferous trees were uprooted during cyclones during the last 40–50 years large areas of former spruce plantings have been replanted with deciduous forest
southern coniferous forest zonealso known as the boreo-nemoral region the southern coniferous forest zone is delimited by the oaks northern natural limit limes norrlandicus and the spruces southern natural limit between the southern deciduous zone and the taiga farther north in the southern parts of this zone the coniferous species are found mainly spruce and pine mixed with various deciduous trees birch grows largely everywhere the beechs northern boundary crosses this zone this is however not the case with oak and ash although in its natural area also planted spruce are common and such woods are very dense as the spruces can grow very tight especially in this vegetation zones southern areas

northern coniferous forest zone or the taigathe northern coniferous forest zone begins north of the natural boundary of the oak of deciduous species the birch is the only one of significance pine and spruce are dominant but the forests are slowly but surely more sparsely grown the farther towards the north it gets in the extreme north is it difficult to state the trees forms true forests at all due to the large distances between the trees

alpine-birch and bare mountain zonesthe alpine-birch zone in the scandinavian mountains depending on both latitude and altitude is an area where only a smaller kind of birch betula pubescens or btortuosa can grow where this vegetation zone ends no trees grow at all the bare mountain zone


 politics 


 constitutional framework 

sweden has four fundamental laws swedish grundlagar which together forms the constitution the instrument of government swedish regeringsformen the act of succession swedish successionsordningen the freedom of the press act swedish tryckfrihetsförordningen and the fundamental law on freedom of expression swedish yttrandefrihetsgrundlagenthe public sector in sweden is divided into two parts the legal person known as the state swedish staten and local authorities the latter includes regional county councils swedish landsting and local municipalities swedish kommuner the local authorities rather than the state make up the larger part of the public sector in sweden county councils and municipalities are independent of one another the former merely covers a larger geographical area than the latter the local authorities have self-rule as mandated by the constitution and their own tax base notwithstanding their self-rule local authorities are nevertheless in practice interdependent upon the state as the parameters of their responsibilities and the extent of their jurisdiction is specified in the local government act swedish kommunallagen passed by the riksdagsweden is a constitutional monarchy and king carl xvi gustaf is the head of state but the role of the monarch is limited to ceremonial and representative functions under the provisions of the 1974 instrument of government the king lacks any formal political power the king opens the annual riksdag session chairs the special council held during a change of government holds regular information councils with the prime minister and the government chairs the meetings of the advisory council on foreign affairs swedish utrikesnämnden and receives letters of credence of foreign ambassadors to sweden and signs those of swedish ambassadors sent abroad in addition the king pays state visits abroad and receives those incoming as host apart from strictly official duties the king and the other members of royal family undertake a variety of unofficial and other representative duties within sweden and abroadlegislative power is vested in the unicameral riksdag with 349 members general elections are held every four years on the second sunday of september legislation may be initiated by the government or by members of the riksdag members are elected on the basis of proportional representation to a four-year term the internal workings of the riksdag is in addition to the instrument of government regulated by the riksdag act swedish riksdagsordningen the fundamental laws can be altered by the riksdag alone only an absolute majority with two separate votes separated by a general election in between is required

the government swedish regeringen operates as a collegial body with collective responsibility and consists of the prime minister — appointed and dismissed by the speaker of the riksdag following an actual vote in the riksdag before an appointment can be made — and other cabinet ministers swedish statsråd appointed and dismissed at the sole discretion of the prime minister the government is the supreme executive authority and is responsible for its actions to the riksdagmost of the state administrative authorities swedish statliga förvaltningsmyndigheter report to the government including but not limited to the armed forces the enforcement authority the national library the swedish police and the tax agency a unique feature of swedish state administration is that individual cabinet ministers do not bear any individual ministerial responsibility for the performance of the agencies within their portfolio as the director-generals and other heads of government agencies reports directly to the government as a whole and individual ministers are prohibited to interfere thus the origin of the pejorative in swedish political parlance term ministerstyre english ministerial rule in matters that are to be handled by the individual agencies unless otherwise specifically provided for in law
the judiciary is independent from the riksdag government and other state administrative authorities the role of judicial review of legislation is not practised by the courts instead the council on legislation gives non-binding opinions on legality there is no stare decisis in that courts are not bound by precedent although it is influential


 political parties and elections 

the swedish social democratic party has played a leading role in swedish politics since 1917 after the reformists had confirmed their strength and the left-wing revolutionaries formed their own party after 1932 most governments have been dominated by the social democrats only five general elections since world war ii—1976 1979 1991 2006 and 2010—have given the assembled bloc of centre-right parties enough seats in the riksdag to form a government
for over 50 years sweden had had five parties who continually received enough votes to gain seats in the riksdag—the social democrats the moderate party the centre party the liberal peoples party and the left party—before the green party became the sixth party in the 1988 election in the 1991 election while the greens lost their seats two new parties gained seats for the first time the christian democrats and new democracy the 1994 election saw the return of the greens and the demise of new democracy it was not until elections in 2010 that an eighth party the sweden democrats gained riksdag seats in the elections to the european parliament parties who have failed to pass the riksdag threshold have managed to gain representation at that venue the june list 2004–2009 the pirate party 2009–2014 and feminist initiative 2014–present

in the 2006 general election the moderate party formed the centre-right alliance for sweden bloc and won a majority of the riksdag seats in the 2010 general election the alliance contended against a unified left block consisting of the social democrats the greens and the left party the alliance won a plurality of 173 seats but remained two seats short of a 175-seat majority nevertheless neither the alliance nor the left block chose to form a coalition with the sweden democratsthe outcome of the 2014 general election resulted in the attainment of more seats by the three centre-left parties in comparison to the centre-right alliance for sweden with the two blocs receiving 159 and 141 seats respectively the non-aligned sweden democrats more than doubled their support and won the remaining 49 seats on 3 october 2014 stefan löfven formed a minority government consisting of the social democrats and the greenselection turnout in sweden has always been high by international comparison although it declined in recent decades the latest elections saw an increase in voter turnout 80.11% in 2002 81.99% in 2006 84.63% in 2010 and 85.81 in 2014 swedish politicians enjoyed a high degree of confidence from the citizens in the 1960s however that level of confidence has since declined steadily and is now at a markedly lower level than in its scandinavian neighbours


 administrative divisions 

sweden is a unitary state divided into 21 county councils landsting and 290 municipalities kommuner every county council corresponds to a county län with a number of municipalities per county county councils and municipalities have different roles and separate responsibilities relating to local government health care public transport and certain cultural institutions are administered by county councils preschools primary and secondary schooling public water utilities garbage disposal elderly care and rescue services are administered by the municipalities gotland is a special case of being a county council with only one municipality and the functions of county council and municipality are performed by the same organisationmunicipal and county council government in sweden is similar to city commission and cabinet-style council government both levels have legislative assemblies municipal councils and county council assemblies of between 31 and 101 members always an uneven number that are elected from party-list proportional representation at the general election which are held every four years in conjunction with the national parliamentary elections
municipalities are also divided into a total of 2,512 parishes församlingar these have no official political responsibilities but are traditional subdivisions of the church of sweden and still have some importance as census districts for census-taking and elections
the swedish government has 21 county administrative boards swedish länsstyrelser which are responsible for regional state administration not assigned to other government agencies or local government each county administrative boards is led by a county governor swedish landshövding appointed for a term of six years the list of previous officeholders for the counties stretches back in most cases to 1634 when the counties were created by lord high chancellor count axel oxenstierna the main responsibility of the county administrative board is to co-ordinate the development of the county in line with goals set by the riksdag and government
there are older historical divisions primarily the twenty-five provinces and three lands which still retain cultural significance


 political history 

the actual age of the kingdom of sweden is unknown establishing the age depends mostly on whether sweden should be considered a nation when the svear sweonas ruled svealand or if the emergence of the nation started with the svear and the götar geats of götaland being united under one ruler in the first case svealand was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year 98 by tacitus but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way however historians usually start the line of swedish monarchs from when svealand and götaland were ruled under the same king namely eric the victorious geat and his son olof skötkonung in the 10th century these events are often described as the consolidation of sweden although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later
earlier kings for which no reliable historical sources exist can be read about in mythical kings of sweden and semi-legendary kings of sweden many of these kings are only mentioned in various saga and blend with norse mythology
the title sveriges och götes konung was last used for gustaf i of sweden after which the title became king of sweden of the goths and of the wends sveriges götes och vendes konung in official documentation up until the beginning of the 1920s all laws in sweden were introduced with the words we the king of sweden of the goths and wends this title was used up until 1973 the present king of sweden carl xvi gustaf was the first monarch officially proclaimed king of sweden sveriges konung with no additional peoples mentioned in his title
the term riksdag was used for the first time in the 1540s although the first meeting where representatives of different social groups were called to discuss and determine affairs affecting the country as a whole took place as early as 1435 in the town of arboga during the riksdag assemblies of 1527 and 1544 under king gustav vasa representatives of all four estates of the realm clergy nobility townsmen and peasants were called on to participate for the first time the monarchy became hereditary in 1544
executive power was historically shared between the king and an aristocratic privy council until 1680 followed by the kings autocratic rule initiated by the commoner estates of the riksdag as a reaction to the failed great northern war a parliamentary system was introduced in 1719 followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in 1772 1789 and 1809 the latter granting several civil liberties already during the first of those three periods the era of liberty 1719–72 the swedish rikstag had developed into a very active parliament and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of that centuryin 1866 sweden became a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliament with the first chamber indirectly elected by local governments and the second chamber directly elected in national elections every four years in 1971 the parliament became unicameral legislative power was symbolically shared between the king and the riksdag until 1975 swedish taxation is controlled by the riksdag

sweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its popular movements folkrörelser the most notable being trade unions the independent christian movement the temperance movement the womens movement and the intellectual property pirate movements sweden was the first country in the world to outlaw corporal punishment of children by their parents parents right to spank their own children was first removed in 1966 and it was explicitly prohibited by law from july 1979
sweden is currently leading the eu in statistics measuring equality in the political system and equality in the education system the global gender gap report 2006 ranked sweden as the number one country in terms of gender equalitysome swedish political figures have become known worldwide among these are raoul wallenberg folke bernadotte the former secretary-general of the united nations dag hammarskjöld the former prime minister olof palme the former prime minister and later foreign minister carl bildt the former president of the general assembly of the united nations jan eliasson and the former international atomic energy agency iraq inspector hans blix


 judicial system 

the courts are divided into two parallel and separate systems the general courts allmänna domstolar for criminal and civil cases and general administrative courts allmänna förvaltningsdomstolar for cases relating to disputes between private persons and the authorities each of these systems has three tiers where the top tier court of the respective system typically only will hear cases that may become precedent there are also a number of special courts which will hear a narrower set of cases as set down by legislation while independent in their rulings some of these courts are operated as divisions within courts of the general or general administrative courts

the supreme court of sweden swedish högsta domstolen is the third and final instance in all civil and criminal cases in sweden before a case can be decided by the supreme court leave to appeal must be obtained and with few exceptions leave to appeal can be granted only when the case is of interest as a precedent the supreme court consists of 16 justices swedish justitieråd appointed by the government but the court as an institution is independent of the riksdag and the government is not able to interfere with the decisions of the court
according to a victimisation survey of 1,201 residents in 2005 sweden has above-average crime rates compared to other eu countries sweden has high or above-average levels of assaults sexual assaults hate crimes and consumer fraud sweden has low levels of burglary car theft and drug problems bribe seeking is rarea mid-november 2013 news report announced that four prisons in sweden were closed during the year due to a significant drop in the number of inmates the decrease in the number of swedish prisoners was considered out-of-the-ordinary by the head of swedens prison and probation services with prison numbers in sweden falling by around 1% a year since 2004 prisons were closed in the towns of åby håja båtshagen and kristianstad


 foreign relations 

throughout the 20th century swedish foreign policy was based on the principle of non-alignment in peacetime and neutrality in wartime swedens government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of warswedens doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the 19th century as the country has not been in a state of war since the end of the swedish campaign against norway in 1814 during world war ii sweden joined neither the allied nor axis powers this has sometimes been disputed since in effect sweden allowed in select cases the nazi regime to use its railroad system to transport troops and goods especially iron ore from mines in northern sweden which was vital to the german war machine however sweden also indirectly contributed to the defence of finland in the winter war and permitted the training of norwegian and danish troops in sweden after 1943

during the early cold war era sweden combined its policy of non-alignment and a low profile in international affairs with a security policy based on strong national defence the function of the swedish military was to deter attack at the same time the country maintained relatively close informal connections with the western bloc especially in the realm of intelligence exchange in 1952 a swedish dc-3 was shot down over the baltic sea by a soviet mig-15 jet fighter later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for nato another plane a catalina search and rescue plane was sent out a few days later and shot down by the soviets as well prime minister olof palme made an official visit to cuba during the 1970s during which he denounced fulgencio batistas government and praised contemporary cuban and cambodian revolutionaries in a speech
beginning in the late 1960s sweden attempted to play a more significant and independent role in international relations it involved itself significantly in international peace efforts especially through the united nations and in support to the third world
on 27 october 1981 a whiskey-class submarine u 137 from the soviet union ran aground close to the naval base at karlskrona in the southern part of the country research has never clearly established whether the submarine ended up on the shoals through a navigational mistake or if an enemy committed espionage against swedish military potential the incident triggered a diplomatic crisis between sweden and the soviet union following the 1986 assassination of olof palme and with the end of the cold war sweden has adopted a more traditional foreign policy approach nevertheless the country remains active in peace keeping missions and maintains a considerable foreign aid budget
since 1995 sweden has been a member of the european union and as a consequence of a new world security situation the countrys foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified with sweden playing a more active role in european security co-operation


 military 

the law is enforced in sweden by several government entities the swedish police is a government agency concerned with police matters the national task force is a national swat unit within the police service the swedish security services responsibilities are counter-espionage anti-terrorist activities protection of the constitution and protection of sensitive objects and people
försvarsmakten swedish armed forces is a government agency reporting to the swedish ministry of defence and responsible for the peacetime operation of the armed forces of sweden the primary task of the agency is to train and deploy peace support forces abroad while maintaining the long-term ability to refocus on the defence of sweden in the event of war the armed forces are divided into army air force and navy the head of the armed forces is the supreme commander överbefälhavaren öb the most senior commissioned officer in the country up to 1974 the king was pro forma commander-in-chief but in reality it was clearly understood all through the 20th century that the monarch would have no active role as a military leader

until the end of the cold war nearly all males reaching the age of military service were conscripted in recent years the number of conscripted males has shrunk dramatically while the number of female volunteers has increased slightly recruitment has generally shifted towards finding the most motivated recruits rather than solely those otherwise most fit for service all soldiers serving abroad must by law be volunteers in 1975 the total number of conscripts was 45,000 by 2003 it was down to 15,000
on 1 july 2010 sweden stopped routine conscription switching to an all volunteer force unless otherwise required for defence readiness the need to recruit only the soldiers later prepared to volunteer for international service will be emphasised the total forces gathered would consist of about 60,000 men this could be compared with the 1980s before the fall of the soviet union when sweden could gather up to 1,000,000 men
however on 11 december 2014 due to tensions in the baltic area the swedish government reintroduced one part of the swedish conscription system refresher training on 2 march 2017 the swedish government decided to reintroduce the remaining part of the swedish conscription system the basic military training the first recruits will begin their training in 2018 as the law now is gender neutral both men and women may have to serviceswedish units have taken part in peacekeeping operations in the democratic republic of the congo cyprus bosnia and herzegovina kosovo liberia lebanon afghanistan and chad


 economy 

sweden is the sixteenth-richest country in the world in terms of gdp gross domestic product per capita and a high standard of living is experienced by its citizens sweden is an export-oriented mixed economy timber hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy with a heavy emphasis on foreign trade swedens engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports while telecommunications the automotive industry and the pharmaceutical industries are also of great importance sweden is the ninth-largest arms exporter in the world agriculture accounts for 2% of gdp and employment the country ranks among the highest for telephone and internet access penetrationtrade unions employers associations and collective agreements cover a large share of the employees in sweden the high coverage of collective agreements is achieved despite the absence of state mechanisms extending collective agreements to whole industries or sectors both the prominent role of collective bargaining and the way in which the high rate of coverage is achieved reflect the dominance of self-regulation regulation by the labour market parties themselves over state regulation in swedish industrial relations when the swedish ghent system was changed in 2007 resulting in considerably raised fees to unemployment funds a substantial decline in union density and density of unemployment funds occurred

in 2010 swedens income gini coefficient was the third lowest among developed countries at 0.25—slightly higher than japan and denmark—suggesting sweden had low income inequality however swedens wealth gini coefficient at 0.853 was the second highest in developed countries and above european and north american averages suggesting high wealth inequality even on a disposable income basis the geographical distribution of gini coefficient of income inequality varies within different regions and municipalities of sweden danderyd outside stockholm has swedens highest gini coefficient of income inequality at 0.55 while hofors near gävle has the lowest at 0.25 in and around stockholm and scania two of the more densely populated regions of sweden the income gini coefficient is between 0.35 and 0.55in terms of structure the swedish economy is characterised by a large knowledge-intensive and export-oriented manufacturing sector an increasing but comparatively small business service sector and by international standards a large public service sector large organisations both in manufacturing and services dominate the swedish economy high and medium-high technology manufacturing accounts for 9.9% of gdpthe 20 largest by turnover registered swedish companies in 2007 were volvo ericsson vattenfall skanska sony ericsson mobile communications ab svenska cellulosa aktiebolaget electrolux volvo personvagnar teliasonera sandvik scania ica hennes  mauritz ikea nordea preem atlas copco securitas nordstjernan and skf the vast majority of swedens industry is privately controlled unlike many other industrialised western countries and in accordance with a historical standard publicly owned enterprises are of minor importance

an estimated 4.5 million swedish residents are employed and around a third of the workforce completed tertiary education in terms of gdp per-hour-worked sweden was the worlds ninth highest in 2006 at us31 compared to us22 in spain and us35 in the united states gdp per-hour-worked is growing 2.5% per year for the economy as a whole and the trade-terms-balanced productivity growth is 2 according to the oecd deregulation globalisation and technology sector growth have been key productivity drivers sweden is a world leader in privatised pensions and pension funding problems are relatively small compared to many other western european countries a pilot program to test the feasibility of a six-hour workday without loss of pay will commence in 2014 involving the participation of gothenburg municipal staff the swedish government is seeking to reduce its costs through decreased sick leave hours and increased efficiency

the typical worker receives 40% of his or her labour costs after the tax wedge total tax collected by sweden as a percentage of its gdp peaked at 52.3% in 1990 the country faced a real estate and banking crisis in 1990–1991 and consequently passed tax reforms in 1991 to implement tax rate cuts and tax base broadening over time since 1990 taxes as a percentage of gdp collected by sweden have been dropping with total tax rates for the highest income earners dropping the most in 2010 45.8% of the countrys gdp was collected as taxes the second highest among oecd countries and nearly double the percentage in the us or south korea tax income-financed employment represents a third of the swedish workforce a substantially higher proportion than in most other countries overall gdp growth has been fast since reforms—especially those in manufacturing—were enacted in the early 1990s

sweden is the fourth-most competitive economy in the world according to the world economic forum in its global competitiveness report 2012–2013 sweden is the top performing country in the 2014 global green economy index ggei sweden is ranked fourth in the imd world competitiveness yearbook 2013 according to the book the flight of the creative class by the us economist professor richard florida of the university of toronto sweden is ranked as having the best creativity in europe for business and is predicted to become a talent magnet for the worlds most purposeful workers the book compiled an index to measure the kind of creativity it claims is most useful to business—talent technology and tolerancesweden maintains its own currency the swedish krona sek a result of the swedes having rejected the euro in a referendum the swedish riksbank—founded in 1668 and thus the oldest central bank in the world—is currently focusing on price stability with an inflation target of 2 according to the economic survey of sweden 2007 by the oecd the average inflation in sweden has been one of the lowest among european countries since the mid-1990s largely because of deregulation and quick utilisation of globalisationthe largest trade flows are with germany the united states norway the united kingdom denmark and finland
financial deregulation in the 1980s impacted adversely on the property market leading to a bubble and eventually a crash in the early 1990s commercial property prices fell by up to two thirds resulting in two swedish banks having to be taken over by the government in the following two decades the property sector strengthened by 2014 legislators economists and the imf were again warning of a bubble with residential property prices soaring and the level of personal mortgage debt expanding household debt-to-income rose above 170% as the imf was calling on legislators to consider zoning reform and other means of generating a greater supply of housing as demand was outstripping what was available pushing prices higher by august 2014 40% of home borrowers had interest-only loans while those that didnt were repaying principal at a rate that would take 100 years to fully repay

 language 

the official language of sweden is swedish a north germanic language related and very similar to danish and norwegian but differing in pronunciation and orthography norwegians have little difficulty understanding swedish and danes can also understand it with slightly more difficulty than norwegians the same goes for standard swedish speakers who find it far easier to understand norwegian than danish the dialects spoken in scania the southernmost part of the country are influenced by danish because the region traditionally was a part of denmark and is nowadays situated closely to it sweden finns are swedens largest linguistic minority comprising about 5% of swedens population and finnish is recognised as a minority language owing to a recent influx of native speakers of arabic in latter years the use of arabic is likely more widespread in the country than that of finnish however no official statistics are kept on language usealong with finnish four other minority languages are also recognised meänkieli sami romani and yiddish swedish became swedens official language on 1 july 2009 when a new language law was implemented the issue of whether swedish should be declared the official language had been raised in the past and the riksdag voted on the matter in 2005 but the proposal narrowly failedin varying degrees depending largely on frequency of interaction with english a majority of swedes especially those born after world war ii understand and speak english owing to trade links the popularity of overseas travel a strong anglo-american influence and the tradition of subtitling rather than dubbing foreign television shows and films and the relative similarity of the two languages which makes learning english easier in a 2005 survey by eurobarometer 89% of swedes reported the ability to speak englishenglish became a compulsory subject for secondary school students studying natural sciences as early as 1849 and has been a compulsory subject for all swedish students since the late 1940s depending on the local school authorities english is currently a compulsory subject between first grade and ninth grade with all students continuing in secondary school studying english for at least another year most students also study one and sometimes two additional languages these include but are not limited to german french and spanish some danish and norwegian is at times also taught as part of swedish courses for native speakers because of the extensive mutual intelligibility between the three continental scandinavian languages swedish speakers often use their native language when visiting or living in norway or denmark


 religion 

before the 11th century swedes adhered to norse paganism worshiping æsir gods with its centre at the temple in uppsala with christianisation in the 11th century the laws of the country changed forbidding worship of other deities until the late 19th century after the protestant reformation in the 1530s a change led by martin luthers swedish associate olaus petri the authority of the roman catholic church was abolished and lutheranism became widespread adoption of lutheranism was completed by the uppsala synod of 1593 and it became the official religion during the era following the reformation usually known as the period of lutheran orthodoxy small groups of non-lutherans especially calvinist dutchmen the moravian church and french huguenots played a significant role in trade and industry and were quietly tolerated as long as they kept a low religious profile the sami originally had their own shamanistic religion but they were converted to lutheranism by swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries

with religious liberalisations in the late 18th century believers of other faiths including judaism and roman catholicism were allowed to live and work freely in the country however until 1860 it remained illegal for lutherans to convert to another religion the 19th century saw the arrival of various evangelical free churches and towards the end of the century secularism leading many to distance themselves from church rituals leaving the church of sweden became legal with the so-called dissenter law of 1860 but only under the provision of entering another christian denomination the right to stand outside any religious denomination was formally established in the law on freedom of religion in 1951
in 2000 the church of sweden was disestablished sweden was the second nordic country to disestablish its state church after finland did so in the church act of 1869at the end of 2016 61.2% of swedes belonged to the church of sweden this number has been decreasing by about 1.5 percentage points a year for the last 5 years and one percentage point a year on average for the last two decades approximately 2% of the churchs members regularly attend sunday services the reason for the large number of inactive members is partly that until 1996 children automatically became members at birth if at least one of the parents was a member since 1996 only children that are christened become members some 275,000 swedes are today members of various evangelical protestant free churches where congregation attendance is much higher and due to recent immigration there are now some 100,000 eastern orthodox christians and 92,000 roman catholics living in swedenthe first muslim congregation was established in 1949 when a small contingent of tatars migrated from finland islams presence in sweden remained marginal until the 1960s when sweden started to receive migrants from the balkans and turkey further immigration from north africa and the middle east have brought the estimated muslim population to 600,000 however only about 110,000 were members of a congregation around 2010according to the eurobarometer poll 2010
18% of swedish citizens responded that they believe there is a god
45% answered that they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force
34% answered that they do not believe there is any sort of spirit god or life forceaccording to a demoskop study in 2015 about the beliefs of the swedish showed that

the swedish government treats public and independent schools equally by introducing education vouchers in 1992 as one of the first countries in the world after the netherlands anyone can establish a for-profit school and the municipality must pay new schools the same amount as municipal schools get school lunch is free for all students in sweden and providing breakfast is also encouragedthere are a number of different universities and colleges in sweden the oldest and largest of which are situated in uppsala lund gothenburg and stockholm in 2000 32% of swedish people held a tertiary degree making the country 5th in the oecd in that category along with several other european countries the government also subsidises tuition of international students pursuing a degree at swedish institutions although a recent bill passed in the riksdag will limit this subsidy to students from eea countries and switzerlandthe large influx of immigrants to swedish schools has been cited as a significant part of the reason why sweden has dropped more than any other european country in the international pisa rankings


 immigration 

immigration has been a major source of population growth and cultural change throughout much of the history of sweden and in recent centuries the country has been transformed from a nation of net emigration ending after world war i to a nation of net immigration from world war ii onwards the economic social and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding ethnicity economic benefits jobs for non-immigrants settlement patterns impact on upward social mobility crime and voting behaviourthere are no exact numbers on the ethnic background of migrants and their descendants in sweden because the swedish government does not base any statistics on ethnicity this is however not to be confused with the migrants national backgrounds which are recorded
