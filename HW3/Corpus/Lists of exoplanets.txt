this is a list of exoplanets as of  7 march 2019 there are 3,924 confirmed exoplanets the majority of these planets were discovered by the kepler space telescope in addition to the confirmed exoplanets there are 2,423 potential exoplanets from its first mission that are yet to be confirmed and 536 from its second light missionfor yearly lists on physical orbital and other properties as well as on discovery circumstances and other aspects see § specific exoplanet lists


 nomenclature 

the convention for designating exoplanets is an extension of the system used for designating multiple-star systems as adopted by the international astronomical union iau for exoplanets orbiting a single star the designation is normally formed by taking the name or more commonly designation of its parent star and adding a lower case letter the first planet discovered in a system is given the designation b the parent star is considered to be a and later planets are given subsequent letters if several planets in the same system are discovered at the same time the closest one to the star gets the next letter followed by the other planets in order of orbital size a provisional iau-sanctioned standard exists to accommodate the designation of circumbinary planets a limited number of exoplanets have iau-sanctioned proper names other naming systems exist 


 methods of detection 

about 97% of all the confirmed exoplanets have been discovered by indirect techniques of detection mainly by radial velocity measurements and transit monitoring techniques
