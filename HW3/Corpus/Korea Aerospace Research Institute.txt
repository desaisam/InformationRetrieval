 space launch vehicles 


 kslv-1 and kslv-2 

kslv-1 launched on august 25 2009 it was originally a cluster indigenous liquid ksr-iii rockets with a solid propellant to form a multistage launcher however kari experienced more difficulties than expected in slv development because it required much stronger propellant power than ksr-iii possessed to launch a satellite into orbit after several failed attempts kari turned to russias khrunichev design bureau for assistance in developing a liquid-propellant rocket engine for the kslv-1 as well as for cooperation in the construction of the launch facility at the naro space center kslv-1 was transformed into a two-stage launcher 33 m high with a maximum diameter of 2.9 m it has a mass of 140 tons at lift-off the first stage of the launcher was derived from the russian urm-1 universal rocket module developed by khrunichev the second stage of the launcher was a solid kick motor developed by korea which includes the inertial navigation system the power control and flight safety systems plus the nose fairing kslv-1 was the most prominent project of the whole south korean space development program and was successfully launched in late january 2013 
south korea is planning to launch its next rocket kslv-2 by year 2019 the first stage of its rocket will have 4 clustered engines each of which will have a 75 metric ton thrust it was announced that kari has already developed few prototypes of a 75 metric ton thrust engine


 kslv-2 tlv 
the test launch vehicle tlv is a two stages rocket used to test the performance of the 75-tons and 7-tons thrust rocket engines that will power the kslv-2 
the tlv is 25.8 meters in length 2.6 meters in diameter and with a mass of 52.1 tons the main-stage kerolox engine is fully gimballed 


 kre-075 engine 


 test flight 1 
the first tlv was launched from the naro space center in goheung south jeolla province 
the main objective of the first suborbital flight was for the  single-stage rockets main engine to burn 140 seconds reaching a 100 km altitude before splashing down in the sea between jeju island and okinawa islandthe maiden flight was first delayed from october 25 2018 for two months due to abnormal readings detected in the rocket propellant pressurization system
the test flight was then rescheduled for november 28 2018 at 1600 kstutc9 no payload is to be placed into orbitthe launch of the first tlv while deemed successful with its main engine burning for 151 seconds in a 10 minute flight was not broadcast live
after reaching a maximum suborbital altitude of 209 kilometers the rocket stage hit the ocean 429 kilometers southeast of jeju


 kslv-3 
kslv-3 was initially designed to launch geostationary satellites of 6 tons and to enter service in 2023
due to the development of the small launch vehicle sslv kslv-iii is changed to geo-slv whith a payload of 3t to geo


 development 


 engines development 
the core stage will powered by four kre-90 engines of 90 tons thrust plus four liquid boosters each with a kre-90 engine the second stage will be powered by a kre-90v staged combustion cycle engine
kre-010v the korean staged combustion cycle engine of 10 tons thrust had a 100 second burn test on december 6th 2018 it will be used as the upper stage 3rd stage engine of kslv-iii


 kre-010v engine 


 kslv-4 
kslv-4 was expected to carry the 64-tons class space stations modules kslv-4 scheduled to enter service in 2028 updated plan
due to the development of the small launch vehicle sslv kslv-iv will be no longer be developed


 small launch vehicle sslv 
by 2025 it should be able to put a payload of less than 500kg to leo


 solid-fuel launcher 
on november 12 2018 the south korean government was discussing with its american counterparts on its plan to develop solid-fuel space vehicles and comparable to the japanese epsilon rocket in performance


 korean lunar exploration program 
in december 2016 kari signed a lunar exploration technical cooperation with nasa which increased the possibility of exploration success greatly the korean lunar exploration program klep is divided in two phases phase 1 incorporates the launch and operation of a lunar orbiter called korea pathfinder lunar orbiter kplo which will be the first lunar probe by south korea meant to develop and enhance south koreas technological capabilities as well as map natural resources from orbit phase 2 will include a lunar obiter a lunar lander and a rover to be launched together on a kslv-ii south korean rocket from the naro space center in 2025


 satellite navigation 
kass is the korean model of satellite-based augmented systems sbas a technology that is capable of reducing gps error to less than 3m
korea is expected to become the only seventh country  in the world to own an sbas beginning in july 2020
this technological achievement is a prerequisite for korea joining the g7


 korea multiple- purpose satellite-3a 
korea multiple-purpose satellite- 3a kompsat-3a was launched on 25 march 2015 on a dnepr-1 launch vehicle from the jasny kombarovsky site in russia the purpose of the kompsat-3a is to enable us to take advantage of geographical information systems gis in environmental agricultural and oceanographic sciences and to facilitate natural hazards the kompsat-3a is equipped with two distinctive sensors a high-resolution multi-spectral ms optical sensor namely the advanced earth image sensor system-a aeiss-a and the scanner infrared imaging system siis


 smart tilt rotor uav 
in late 2011 kari unveiled its tiltrotor unmanned aerial vehicle uav that can fly at around 400 kmhr
