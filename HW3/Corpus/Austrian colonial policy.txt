from the 17th century through to the 19th century the habsburg monarchy austrian empire and austro-hungarian empire attempted to profit from colonial trade through the acquisition of colonies and trade routes  all attempts were ended due to international pressure or lack of interest and support from the imperial government  
technically however the austrians had the largest colonial empire at the time emperor charles v was the crown of both the spanish empire and holy roman empire  austria being one of the holy roman empire states received funds from the spoils of the spanish colonization of the americas


 ostend east india company 

the ostend east india company was a private merchant company formed in 1715 and with imperial support in 1722 to trade with the east indies  their charter was officiated by emperor charles vi who provided the company with 6 million guilders as a public-private monopoly with 6000 shares set a 1000 guilders each due to the speed of the ostenders trade ships the company within a couple of years became one of the largest trading firms in the east and canton by 1720 the ostend company had been transporting 7 million pounds of tea which was about 41.78% of the tea traded from the port of cantonthe private ostend company consisted of two brothers-in-law paulo cloots and jacomo de pret who formed a consortium with two dutch merchant houses of de bruyn and geelhand cloots and de pret also invited the two london houses of hambly and trehee and the french baker antoine crozat to invest in the company after seven years of profitable ventures and much fighting between other merchants in antwerp and ghent charles vi agreed to its petition of official charterin 1715 the ostend company acquired trading charters in the ports of mocha surat and canton  in 1723 the ostenders obtained trading ports in the lucrative harbors of banquibazar and cabelon the trade missions to mocha were initially successful but due to the wreck of the mochaman a trade vessel headed to the red sea in 1720 and the capture of a home-bound vessel by the barbary pirates in 1723 mocha eventually turned into a heavy loss  the ports of surat and canton however continued to be quite profitable   
the company had become such a threat to british dutch portuguese and french interests that when emperor charles vi promulgated the edict of the pragmatic sanction of 1713 it was refused international recognition on the grounds of ostend companys success in the east indies  these international political pressures ended its extraordinary growth and in 1727 the charter was suspended leading to the company being dissolved by 1732
after the imperial governments withdrawal of the ostend companys charter the great powers accepted the pragmatic sanction the suspension also allowed the austrians to sign the treaty of vienna 1731 with the british which allied both powers in the anglo-austrian alliance

 19th-century colonial possibilities 


 north borneo 

in 1878 german-austrian dignitary baron gustav von overbeck purchased land from the sultanates of brunei and sulu and acquired additional land from the american trading company of borneo to form what was then known as north borneo a friend of overbecks william clarke cowie had influence with the sulu sultanate which allowed him to purchase even more land to add to north borneo 
following these purchases overbeck journeyed to europe where he then attempted to sell the newly created north borneo by promoting it as a penal colony he approached austria-hungary the united kingdom the german empire and italy due to the overall lack of interest von overbeck later sold these lands to alfred dent a british colonial merchant who then formed the british north borneo company in 1880 one year later the united kingdom revived interest in the territory and later bought north borneo from dent in 1881north borneo could technically be considered an austrian colony for one reason  baron von overbeck while german was the austro-hungarian consul to hong kong so the control of borneo under an austrian national would define it as a possession of austria-hungary 


 rio de oro 
after the humiliation in the spanish–american war spain wished to divest itself of its colonies and spanish diplomats approached the austro-hungarian colonial society about a possible purchase of the trading port of rio de oro  the societys vice-president ernst weisl made a quiet deal with agenor goluchowsi the minister of foreign affairs for austria goluchowski later convinced the austrian imperial council and emperor franz joseph openly supported the deal a treaty was drawn up to purchase and transfer ownership over to austria-hungary  however the hungarian house of magnates blocked the colonial purchase on the eve of its finalization 
this colonial move made by the austrians was primarily to justify the naval aspirations of several austrian ministers the hungarian parliament had been for some time opposed to naval expansion and the austrians had slowly been pressuring the hungarians for increased naval expenditures in the national budget with the hungarian veto of this purchase this ended further potential colonial expansion and ideas of dramatic naval expansion in austria-hungary


 port of tianjin 

austria-hungary participated in the eight-nation alliance from 1899-1901 this grand alliance was formed to contain the boxer rebellion in china the austro-hungarian navy helped in suppressing the rising however austria-hungary sent the smallest force of any nation only four cruisers and a force of only 296 marines were dispatchedeven so on 27 december 1902 austria gained a concession zone in tianjin as part of the reward for its contribution to the alliance the austrian concession zone was 150 acres 0.61 km2 in area which was slightly larger than the italian but smaller than the belgian zone the self-contained concession had its own prison school barracks and hospital it also contained the austro-hungarian consulate and its citizens were under austrian not chinese rulethe concession was provided with a small garrison and austria-hungary proved unable to maintain control of its concession during the great war the concession zone was swiftly occupied on the chinese declaration of war on the central powers on 14 august 1917 the lease was terminated along with that of the larger german concession in the same city  
austria abandoned all claims to tianjin on 10 september 1919 hungary also made a similar recognition in 1920 however despite its relatively short life-span of 15 years the austrians left their mark on that area of the city as can be seen in the austrian architecture that still stands in the city
