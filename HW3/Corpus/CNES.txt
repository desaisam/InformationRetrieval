the national centre for space studies cnes french centre national détudes spatiales is the french government space agency administratively a public administration with industrial and commercial purpose its headquarters are located in central paris and it is under the supervision of the french ministries of defence and research
it operates from the toulouse space center and guiana space centre but also has payloads launched from space centres operated by other countries the president of cnes is jean-yves le gall cnes is member of institute of space its applications and technologies as of  april 2018 cnes has the second largest national budget—€2.438 billion—of all the worlds civilian space programs after only nasa


 history 
cnes was established under president charles de gaulle in 1961
cnes was responsible for the training of french astronauts until the last active cnes astronauts transferred to the european space agency in 2001
as of  january 2015 cnes is working with germany and a few other governments to start a modest research effort with the hope to propose a loxmethane reusable launch vehicle by mid-2015  if built flight testing would likely not start before approximately 2026  the design objective is to reduce both the cost and duration of reusable vehicle refurbishment and is partially motivated by the pressure of lower-cost competitive options with newer technological capabilities not found in the ariane 6

 programs 
cnes concentrates on five areas
access to space
civil applications of space
sustainable development
science and technology research
security and defence


 access to space 

france was the third space power see diamant to achieve access to space after the ussr and usa sharing technologies with europe to develop the ariane launcher family commercial competition in space is fierce so launch services must be tailored to space operators’ needs the latest versions of the ariane 5 launch vehicle can launch large satellites to geosynchronous orbit or perform dual launches—launching two full-size satellites with one rocket—while the other launch vehicles used for european payloads and commercial satellites—the europeanitalian vega and russian soyuz-2—are small and medium-lift launchers respectively


 sustainable development 
cnes and its partners in europe—through the global monitoring for environment and security initiative gmes—and around the world have put in place satellites dedicated to observing the land oceans and atmosphere as well as to hazard and crisis management
the best-known are the spot satellites flying the vegetation instrument the topexposeidon jason-1 and jason-2 oceanography satellites the argos system envisat and the pleiades satellites


 civil applications 
cnes is taking part in the galileo navigation programme alongside the european union and the european space agency esa and—in a wider international context—in the cospas-sarsat search-and-rescue system


 security and defense 
the aforementioned gallieo navigation programme though intended primarily for civilian navigational use has a military purpose as well like the similar american global positioning system and russian glonass satellite navigational systemsin addition to spot and the future pleiades satellites cnes is working for the defence community as prime contractor for the helios photo-reconnaissance satellites
global monitoring for environment and security—a joint initiative involving the eu esa and national space agencies—pools space resources to monitor the environment and protect populations though it also encompasses satellite support for armed forces on border patrol maritime security and peacekeeping missions


 ongoing missions 
frances contribution to the international space station is giving french scientists the opportunity to perform original experiments in microgravity cnes is also studying formation flying a technique whereby several satellites fly components of a much heavier and complex instrument in a close and tightly-controlled configuration with satellites being as close as tens of meters apart cnes is studying formation flying as part of the swedish-led prisma project and on its own with the simbol-x x-ray telescope missioncnes currently collaborates with other space agencies on a number of projects including orbital telescopes like international gamma-ray astrophysics laboratory xmm-newton and corot and space probes like mars express venus express cassini-huygens and rosetta cnes has collaborated with nasa on missions like the earth observation satellite parasol and the calipso environment and weather satellite it has also collaborated with the indian space agency isro on the megha-tropiques mission which is studying the water cycle and how it has been impacted by climate change cnes plays a major role in the esas living planet programme of earth observation satellites having constructed the soil moisture and ocean salinity satellite


 ufo archive 
in december 2006 cnes announced that it would publish its ufo archive online by late january or mid-february most of the 6,000 reports have been filed by the public and airline professionals jacques arnould an official for the french space agency said that the data had accumulated over a 30-year period and that ufo sightings were often reported to the gendarmerie
in the last two decades of the 20th century france was the only country whose government paid ufo investigators employed by cness ufo section gepan later known as sepra and now as geipan

on march 22 2007 cnes released its ufo files to the public through its website the 100,000 pages of witness testimony photographs film footage and audiotapes are an accumulation of over 1,600 sightings since 1954 and will include all future ufo reports obtained by the agency through its geipan unit


 tracking stations 
the cnes has several tracking stations a partial list follows
kourou in french guiana
issus aussaguel 20 km away from toulouse
kerguelen island french southern and antarctic lands
hartebeesthoek south africa
kiruna sweden for the spot program
