 scientific research 
the invention of climate research through the use of satellite remote telemetry began in the 1960s through development of space probes to study other planets during the us economic decline in 1977 with much of nasas money going toward the shuttle program the reagan administration proposed to reduce spending on planetary exploration during this time new scientific evidence emerged from ice and sediment cores that earths climate had experienced rapid changes in temperature running contrary to the previously held belief that the climate changed on a geological time scale  these changes increased political interest in gathering remote-sensing data on the earth itself and stimulated the science of climatology
