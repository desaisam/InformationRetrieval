 description 
before it was discovered 238p came to perihelion on 2005 july 27 when it was discovered on 2005 october 24 it showed vigorous cometary activity until 2005 december 27 outgassing likely began at least 2 months before discovery the activity of 238p is much stronger than 133pelst-pizarro and 176plinear this may indicate that the impact assumed to have triggered 238ps activity occurred very recentlyobservations of 238p when it was inactive in 2007 suggests that it has a small nucleus only about 0.6 km in diameterit came to perihelion on 2011 march 10 and 2016 october 22 it will next come to perihelion on 2022 june 5.238pread was the target of a mission proposal in nasas discovery program in the 2010s called proteus however it was not selected for further development discovery programs founding mission was to an asteroid but it went to a near-earth asteroid  a mission to a main-belt asteroid was proposed in the 1990s also see deep impact spacecraft
