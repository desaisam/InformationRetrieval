currently the iaio is responsible for directing these aviation organizations saha hesa panha civil aviation industries these organizations have different and complementary roles in iranian aerospace and iranian civil aviationthe iran helicopter support and renewal company ihsrc or panha was formed in 1969 the iranian aircraft industries iaci in 1970 and iran aircraft manufacturing industries corporation iami also known under its persian acronym hesa in 1974 two other important companies iran aviation industries organization of the armed forces also known as the iranian armed forces aviation industries organization iafaio and qods aviation industry company research center were formed in the early 1980s
it is headquartered in the lavizan suburb of tehran and employs more than 10,000 people across 13 major factories in addition to its aerospace work iaio is heavily involved in irans ballistic missile program


 overview 
iaio acts as a policy maker and coordinator to promote an indigenous iranian aeronautical industry by providing and assisting the iranian aircraft industries with needed technologies knowledge and parts
irans aviation industry is making rapid strides as evidenced by the inaugural flight of irans indigenously designed and manufactured azarakhsh and saeqeh fighter jet to the mass production and launch of helicopters turboprops and passenger planes iran has also produced a boeing 737-800 simulator a first in mideast with a population of 81 million iran needs to have 6,300 airplanes while it does not possess more than nine aircraft for every one million individuals


 history 
irans aviation industry infrastructure was by and large established in the 1930s at the time of the shah reza pahlavi where the german junkers  co aviation provided the foreign expertise and assistance
the industry was later expanded in the 1970s in the reign of shah muhammad reza pahlavi benefiting from the boosted oil revenues not only did the shah order vast quantities of america’s most advanced weapons he was also acquiring the capability to produce them in iran under a multibillion-dollar industrialisation programme the shah commissioned us arms firms to build entire weapons factories from scratch in iran
thus bell helicopter a division of textron inc was building a factory to produce model-214 helicopters in isfahan northrop corporation was also a joint partner in iran aircraft industries inc which maintained many of the us military aircraft sold to iran and was expected to produce aircraft components and eventually complete planes these efforts represented a large share of us industrial involvement in iran and were a centrepiece of the shah’s efforts to develop modern high-technology industriesafter western sanctions following the iranian revolution the general official policy of iranian government changed from having the best available in the world to being able to manufacture independently in order to meet domestic needs specially of technological products and therefore becoming sanction-proof
in no other field this urgency was higher than aeronautics therefore iran has avoided the need to purchase better western aircraft available to it from time to time in favor of inferior ones that could be manufactured in iran through arrangements of purchasing licenses and technologies as well as reverse-engineering parts mostly to avoid situations that iran has gone through during the 1980s till now by not being able to maintain what it had due to domestic technological starvation


 major projects 

former iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad had favored the purchase of aircraft such as iran-140 which are manufactured in iraniran’s aviation industries organization plans to manufacture 100 advanced tupolev tu-214 and tu-204 airplanes with a capacity of 210 persons each in cooperation with russia within the next 10 years iran also intends to manufacture at least 50 ka-32 helicopters in iran under license of kamov and negotiations are underway to manufacture 50 an-148 under licence probably with similar arrangements as iran-140 to be named iran-148 agreements were signed with russia for co-development and co-manufacture of an uncertain amount of tu-334 airliners in iran with production to commence simultaneously both in iran and russia another agreement with poltava helicopter company of ukraine allows iran to manufacture the aerokopter ak1-3 sanka ultra-light multi-purpose helicopters in iran yet iran says it is prepared to order passenger planes from boeing and airbus if the united states lifts sanctions against iran in 2010 irans defense ministry said it will begin the production phase of a domestically-manufactured medium-size passenger plane designed to carry up to 150 passengers this project is scheduled to be completed by 2018 qaher-313 single-seat stealth fighter aircraft prototype was publicly announced in 2013 in 2016 iran aviation technology development headquarter iatdh reached agreement for the transfer of technology with a number of knowledge-based french companies in the field of avionics and partsin august 2018 iaio unveiled the kowsar or kosar jet trainer and strike aircraft ahead of its maiden flight the kowsar will be produced in single and two-seater versions


 jet engines 

in 2016 iran unveiled its first national turbojet engine dubbed owj zenith manufactured with more than 14,000 parts it is capable of flight at 50,000 feet and can be mounted on planes with a maximum takeoff weight of ten tons iran says that superalloys and specialized furnaces made in iran have been used for this engine some analysts have pointed out that this engine shows close resemblance to the general electric j85 turbojet engine expected to serve with us air force until 2040


 legal issues 
in 2006 textron sued iaio for producing counterfeits of six types of its bell unit helicopters without licenses thereby using trade secrets and patented designs without permission and demanded compensation for damages in another lawsuit bell helicopter textron inc v islamic republic of iran case no 06cv1694 in us district court for the district of columbia brought by iran against textron earlier iran had sought damages against unfulfilled contracts dating back before revolution textron ultimately sent five commercial helicopters to iran in addition to providing spare parts and training in 1994 to settle the disputein summer of 2010 iran requested that the united states deliver the 80th f-14 it had purchased in 1974 but delivery was denied after the islamic revolution
