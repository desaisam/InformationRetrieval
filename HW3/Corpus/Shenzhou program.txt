the shenzhou program  chinese 神舟 is a manned spaceflight initiative by china the program put the first chinese citizen yang liwei into orbit on 15 october 2003
development began in 1992 under the name of project 921-1 the chinese national manned space program was given the designation project 921 with project 921-1 as its first significant goal the plan called for a manned launch in october 1999 prior to the new millenniumthe first four unmanned test flights happened in 1999 2001 and 2002  these were followed by 2 manned missions the second one was launched on 12 october 2005 the shenzhou missions were launched on the long march 2f from the jiuquan satellite launch center the command center of the mission is the beijing aerospace command and control center the china manned space engineering office provides engineering and administrative support for the manned shenzhou missionsthe name shenzhou is variously translated as divine vessel divine craft or divine ship


 history 
chinas first efforts at human spaceflight started in 1968 with a projected launch date of 1973 although china did launch an unmanned satellite in 1970 and has maintained an active unmanned program since the manned spaceflight program was cancelled due to lack of funds and political interestthe current chinese human spaceflight program was authorized on 1 april 1992 as project 921-1 with work beginning on 1 january 1993 the initial plan has three phases
phase 1 would involve launch of two unmanned versions of the manned spacecraft followed by the first chinese manned spaceflight by 2002
phase 2 would run through 2007 and involve a series of flights to prove the technology conduct rendezvous and docking operations in orbit and operate an 8-ton spacelab using the basic spacecraft technology
phase 3 would involve orbiting of a 20-ton space station in the 2010–2015 period with crews being shuttled to it using the 8-ton manned spacecraftthe chief designers include qi faren and wang yongzhi the first unmanned flight of the spacecraft was launched on 19 november 1999 after which project 921-1 was renamed shenzhou a name reportedly chosen by jiang zemin a series of three additional unmanned flights ensued the shenzhou reentry capsules used to date are 13 percent larger than soyuz reentry capsules and it is expected that later craft will be designed to carry a crew of four instead of soyuzs three although physical limitations on astronaut size as experienced with earlier incarnations of soyuz will likely applythe fifth launch shenzhou 5 was the first to carry a human yang liwei and occurred at 900 cst utc 8 on 15 october 2003like similar space programs in other nations shenzhou has raised some questions about whether china should spend money on launching people into space arguing that these resources would be better directed elsewhere indeed two earlier human spaceflight programs one in the mid-1970s and the other in the 1980s were cancelled because of expense in response several justifications have been offered in the chinese media  one is that the long-term destiny of humanity lies in the exploration of space and that china should not be left behind  another is that such a program will catalyze the development of science and technology in china  finally it has been argued that the prestige resulting from this capability will increase chinas stature in the world in a similar manner to the 2008 olympicson 17 october 2005 following the success of shenzhou 6 chinese media officially stated that the cost of this flight was around us110 million and the gross cost of project 921/1 in the past 11 years was us2.3 billion these values are lower than the cost of similar space programs in other nationsthe chinese media has heavily promoted the experiments undertaken by shenzhou particularly exposing seeds including some from taiwan to zero gravity and radiation  most scientists however discount the usefulness of this type of experimentthe experience during the 1960s of both the united states with the manned orbiting laboratory and the soviet union with the almaz space station suggests that the military usefulness of human spaceflight is quite limited and that practically all military uses of space are much more effectively performed by unmanned satellites  thus while the shenzhou orbital module could be used for military reconnaissance there appears to be no military reason for incorporating such a system in a manned mission as china could use purely unmanned satellites for these purposes


 shenzhou spacecraft 

the shenzhou spacecraft resembles the russian soyuz although it is substantially larger unlike the soyuz it features a powered orbital module capable of autonomous flight
like soyuz shenzhou consists of three modules a forward orbital module 轨道舱 a reentry capsule 返回舱 in the middle and an aft service module 推进舱 this division is based on the principle of minimizing the amount of material to be returned to earth  anything placed in the orbital or service modules does not require heat shielding and this greatly increases the space available in the spacecraft without increasing weight as much as it would need to be if those modules needed to withstand reentry
