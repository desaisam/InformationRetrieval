spacelab was a reusable laboratory used on certain spaceflights flown by the space shuttle the laboratory comprised multiple components including a pressurized module an unpressurized carrier and other related hardware housed in the shuttles cargo bay the components were arranged in various configurations to meet the needs of each spaceflight
spacelab components flew on a total of 32 shuttle missions spacelab allowed scientists to perform experiments in microgravity in earth orbit there was a variety of spacelab-associated hardware so a distinction can be made between the major spacelab program missions with european scientists running missions in the spacelab habitable module missions running other spacelab hardware experiments and other sts missions that used some component of spacelab hardware there is some variation in counts of spacelab missions in part because there were different types of spacelab missions with a large range in the amount of spacelab hardware flown and the nature of each mission there were at least 22 major spacelab missions between 1983 and 1998 and spacelab hardware was used on a number other missions with some of the spacelab pallets being flown as late as 2008


 background and history 

in august 1973 nasa and esro now european space agency or esa signed a memorandum of understanding mou to build a science laboratory for use on space shuttle flights  construction of spacelab was started in 1974 by erno a subsidiary of vfw-fokker gmbh after merger with mbb named mbberno and merged into eads space transportation in 2003 the first lab module lm1 was donated to nasa in exchange for flight opportunities for european astronauts  a second module lm2 was bought by nasa for its own use from ernoconstruction on the spacelab modules began in 1974 by what was then the company erno-vfw-fokker
spacelab is important to all of us for at least four good reasons it expanded the shuttles ability to conduct science on-orbit manyfold it provided a marvelous opportunity and example of a large international joint venture involving government industry and science with our european allies the european effort provided the free world with a really versatile laboratory system several years before it would have been possible if the united states had had to fund it on its own and finally it provided europe with the systems development and management experience they needed to move into the exclusive manned space flight arena

in the early 1970s nasa shifted its focus from the lunar missions to the space shuttle and also space research the nasa administrator at the time moved the focus from a new space station to space laboratory for planned space shuttle this would allow technologies for future space stations to be researched and harness the capabilities of the space shuttle for researchspacelab was produced by a consortium of ten european countries including
austria 
belgium 
denmark 
france 
west germany 
italy 
netherlands 
spain 
switzerland 
united kingdom 


 components 

in addition to the laboratory module the complete set also included five external pallets for experiments in vacuum built by british aerospace bae and a pressurized igloo containing the subsystems needed for the pallet-only flight configuration operation eight flight configurations were qualified though more could be assembled if needed
spacelab consisted of a variety of interchangeable components with the major one being manned laboratory that could be flown in space shuttle orbiters bay and returned to earth however the habitable module did not have to be flown to conduct a spacelab-type mission and there was a variety of pallets and other hardware supporting space research the habitable module expanded the volume for astronauts to work in a shirt sleeve environment and had space for equipment racks and related support equipment when the habitable module was not used some of the support equipment for the pallets could be housed in the smaller igloo a pressurized cylinder connected to the space shuttle orbiter crew areaspacelab mission typically supported multiple experiments and the spacelab 1 mission had experiments in the fields of space plasma physics solar physics atmosphere physics astronomy and earth observation the selection of appropriate modules was part of mission planning for spacelab shuttle missions and for example a mission might need less habitable space and more pallets or vice versa


 habitable module 

the spacelab module comprises a cylindrical main laboratory configurable as short or long module flown in the rear of the space shuttle cargo bay connected to the crew compartment by a tunnel  the laboratory had an outer diameter of 4.12 meters 13.5 ft and each segment a length of 2.7 meters 8.9 ft most of the time two segments were used in forming the long module configuration

a pressurized tunnel connected the space shuttle orbiter main cabin to spacelab habitable modules with a connection point at the mid-deck there was two different length tunnels depending on the location of the hm in the payload bay when the habitable module was not used but additional space was needed for support equipment another structure called the igloo could be usedthe larger configuration of the habitation module consisted of the core module and experiment module it was also possible to operate spacelab experiments from the space shuttle orbiter aft flight decktwo habitable modules were built named lm1 and lm2 lm2 is now on display in the bremenhalle exhibition in the bremen airport of bremen germany  lm1 is now on display at the udvar-hazy center at the smithsonian air and space museum behind the space shuttle discovery


 pallet 

the spacelab pallet is a u-shaped platform for mounting instrumentation large instruments experiments requiring exposure to space and instruments requiring a large field of view such as telescopes  the pallet has several hard points for mounting heavy equipment  the pallet can be used in single configuration or stacked end to end in double or triple configurations  up to five pallets can be configured in the space shuttle cargo bay by using a double pallet plus triple pallet configurations
the spacelab pallet used to transport both canadarm-2 and dextre to the international space station is currently at the canada aviation and space museum on loan from nasa through the canadian space agency csaa spacelab pallet was transferred to the swiss museum of transport for permanent display on 5 march 2010 the pallet nicknamed elvis was used during the eight-day sts-46 mission 31 july – 8 august 1992 when esa astronaut claude nicollier was on board shuttle atlantis to deploy esas european retrievable carrier eureca scientific mission and the joint nasaitalian space agency tethered satellite system tss-1 the pallet carried tss-1 in the shuttles cargo bayanother spacelab pallet is on display at the us national air and space museum in washington dc there was a total of ten space-flown spacelab pallets


 igloo 
on spaceflight where a habitable module was not flown but pallets were flown a pressurized cylinder known as the igloo carried the subsystems needed to operate the spacelab equipment the igloo was 10 feet tall had a diameter of 5 feet and weighed 2,500 lb two igloo units were manufactured both by belgium company sabca and both were used on spaceflight an igloo component was flown on spacelab 2 astro-1 atlas-1 atlas-2 atlas-3 and astro-2a spacelab igloo is on display at the james s mcdonnell space hangar at the steven f udvar-hazy center in the united states


 instrument pointing system 
the ips was a gimbaled pointing device capable of aiming telescopes cameras or other instruments ips was used on three different space shuttle missions between 1985 and 1995 ips was manufactured by dornier and two units were made the ips was primarily constructed out of aluminum steel and multi-layer insulationips would be mounted inside the payload bay of the space shuttle orbiter and could provide gimbaled 3-axis pointing it was designed for a pointing accuracy of less than 1 arcsecond a unit of degree and three pointing modes including earth sun and stellar focused modes the ips was mounted on a pallet exposed to outer space in the payload bayips missions
spacelab 2 aka sts-51-f launched 1985
astro-1 aka sts-35 launched 1990
astro-2 aka sts-67 launched 1995the spacelab 2 mission flew the infrared telescope irt which was a 15.2 cm aperture helium-cooled infrared telescope observing light between wavelengths of 1.7 to 118 μm irt collected infrared data on 60% of the galactic plane

 legacy 

the legacy of spacelab lives on in the form of the mplms and the systems derived from it these systems include the atv and cygnus spacecraft used to transfer payloads to the international space station and the columbus harmony and tranquility modules of the international space stationthe spacelab 2 mission surveyed 60% of the galactic plane in infrared in 1985spacelab was an extremely large program and this was enhanced by different experiments and multiple payloads and configurations over two decades for example in a subset of just one part of the spacelab 1 sts-9 mission no less than eight different imaging systems were flown into space including those experiments there was a total of 73 separate experiments across different disciplines on the spacelab 1 flight alone spacelab missions conducted experiments in materials life solar astrophysics atmospheric and earth science
spacelab represents a major investment on the order of one billion dollars from our european friends but its completion marks something equally important the commitment of a dogged dedicated and talented team drawn from esa governments universities and industries who stuck with it for a decade and saw the project through we are proud of your perseverance and congratulate you on your success
