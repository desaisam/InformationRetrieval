 history 


 before 895 

the roman empire conquered the territory west of the danube between 35 and 9 bc from 9 bc to the end of the 4th century pannonia was part of the roman empire located within part of later hungarys territory around ad 41–54 a 500-strong cavalry unit created the settlement of aquincum and a roman legion of 6,000 men was stationed here by ad 89 a civil city grew gradually in the neighbourhood of the military settlement and in ad 106 aquincum became the focal point of the commercial life of this area and the capital city of the province of pannonia inferior this area now corresponds to the óbuda district of budapest with the roman ruins now forming part of the modern aquincum museum later came the huns a central asian tribe who built a powerful empire after hunnish rule the germanic ostrogoths lombards and gepids and the avar khaganate had a presence in the carpathian basinin the 9th century east francia the first bulgarian empire and great moravia ruled the territory of the carpathian basin the freshly unified hungarians led by árpád by tradition a descendant of attila settled in the carpathian basin starting in 895 according to linguistic evidence they originated from an ancient uralic-speaking population that formerly inhabited the forested area between the volga river and the ural mountains


 medieval hungary 895–1526 

as a federation of united tribes hungary was established in 895 some 50 years after the division of the carolingian empire at the treaty of verdun in 843 before the unification of the anglo-saxon kingdoms initially the rising principality of hungary western tourkia in medieval greek sources was a state consisting of a semi-nomadic people it accomplished an enormous transformation into a christian realm during the 10th centurythis state was well-functioning and the nations military power allowed the hungarians to conduct successful fierce campaigns and raids from constantinople to as far as todays spain the hungarians defeated no fewer than three major east frankish imperial armies between 907 and 910 a later defeat at the battle of lechfeld in 955 signaled a provisory end to most campaigns on foreign territories at least towards the west


 age of árpádian kings 

the year 972 marked the date when the ruling prince hungarian fejedelem géza of the árpád dynasty officially started to integrate hungary into the christian western europe his first-born son saint stephen i became the first king of hungary after defeating his pagan uncle koppány who also claimed the throne under stephen hungary was recognized as a catholic apostolic kingdom applying to pope sylvester ii stephen received the insignia of royalty including probably a part of the holy crown of hungary currently kept in the hungarian parliament from the papacy

by 1006 stephen consolidated his power and started sweeping reforms to convert hungary into a western feudal state the country switched to using the latin language and until as late as 1844 latin remained the official language of hungary around this time hungary began to become a powerful kingdom ladislaus i extended hungarys frontier in transylvania and invaded croatia in 1091 the croatian campaign culminated in the battle of gvozd mountain in 1097 and a personal union of croatia and hungary in 1102 ruled by coloman ie könyves kálmánthe most powerful and wealthiest king of the árpád dynasty was béla iii who disposed of the equivalent of 23 tonnes of pure silver a year this exceeded the income of the french king estimated at 17 tonnes and was double the receipts of the english crownandrew ii issued the diploma andreanum which secured the special privileges of the transylvanian saxons and is considered the first autonomy law in the world he led the fifth crusade to the holy land in 1217 setting up the largest royal army in the history of crusades his golden bull of 1222 was the first constitution in continental europe the lesser nobles also began to present andrew with grievances a practice that evolved into the institution of the parliament parlamentum publicum
in 1241–1242 the kingdom received a major blow with the mongol tatar invasion up to half of hungarys then population of 2,000,000 were victims of the invasion king béla iv let cumans and jassic people into the country who were fleeing the mongols over the centuries they were fully assimilated into the hungarian populationas a consequence after the mongols retreated king béla ordered the construction of hundreds of stone castles and fortifications to defend against a possible second mongol invasion the mongols returned to hungary in 1285 but the newly built stone-castle systems and new tactics using a higher proportion of heavily armed knights stopped them the invading mongol force was defeated near pest by the royal army of ladislaus iv of hungary as with later invasions it was repelled handily the mongols losing much of their invading force


 age of elected kings 

the kingdom of hungary reached one of its greatest extents during the árpádian kings yet royal power was weakened at the end of their rule in 1301 after a destructive period of interregnum 1301–1308 the first angevin king charles i of hungary – a bilineal descendant of the árpád dynasty – successfully restored royal power and defeated oligarch rivals the so-called little kings the second angevin hungarian king louis the great 1342–1382 led many successful military campaigns from lithuania to southern italy kingdom of naples and was also king of poland from 1370 after king louis died without a male heir the country was stabilized only when sigismund of luxembourg 1387–1437 succeeded to the throne who in 1433 also became holy roman emperor sigismund was also in several ways a bilineal descendant of the árpád dynasty

the first hungarian bible translation was completed in 1439 for half a year in 1437 there was an antifeudal and anticlerical peasant revolt in transylvania the budai nagy antal revolt which was strongly influenced by hussite ideas
from a small noble family in transylvania john hunyadi grew to become one of the countrys most powerful lords thanks to his outstanding capabilities as a mercenary commander he was elected governor then regent he was a successful crusader against the ottoman turks one of his greatest victories being the siege of belgrade in 1456
the last strong king of medieval hungary was the renaissance king matthias corvinus 1458–1490 son of john hunyadi his election was the first time that a member of the nobility mounted to the hungarian royal throne without dynastic background he was a successful military leader and an enlightened patron of the arts and learning his library the bibliotheca corviniana was europes greatest collection of historical chronicles philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century and second only in size to the vatican library items from the bibliotheca corviniana were inscribed on unescos memory of the world register in 2005the serfs and common people considered him a just ruler because he protected them from excessive demands from and other abuses by the magnates under his rule in 1479 the hungarian army destroyed the ottoman and wallachian troops at the battle of breadfield abroad he defeated the polish and german imperial armies of frederick at breslau wrocław matthias mercenary standing army the black army of hungary was an unusually large army for its time and it conquered parts of austria vienna 1485 and parts of bohemia


 decline of hungary 1490–1526 
king matthias died without lawful sons and the hungarian magnates procured the accession of the pole vladislaus ii 1490–1516 supposedly because of his weak influence on hungarian aristocracy hungarys international role declined its political stability shaken and social progress was deadlocked in 1514 the weakened old king vladislaus ii faced a major peasant rebellion led by györgy dózsa which was ruthlessly crushed by the nobles led by john zápolya
the resulting degradation of order paved the way for ottoman pre-eminence in 1521 the strongest hungarian fortress in the south nándorfehérvár todays belgrade serbia fell to the turks the early appearance of protestantism further worsened internal relations in the country


 ottoman wars 1526–1699 

after some 150 years of wars with the hungarians and other states the ottomans gained a decisive victory over the hungarian army at the battle of mohács in 1526 where king louis ii died while fleeing amid political chaos the divided hungarian nobility elected two kings simultaneously john zápolya and ferdinand i of the habsburg dynasty with the conquest of buda by the turks in 1541 hungary was divided into three parts and remained so until the end of the 17th century the north-western part termed as royal hungary was annexed by the habsburgs who ruled as kings of hungary the eastern part of the kingdom became independent as the principality of transylvania under ottoman and later habsburg suzerainty the remaining central area including the capital buda was known as the pashalik of buda

the vast majority of the seventeen and nineteen thousand ottoman soldiers in service in the ottoman fortresses in the territory of hungary were orthodox and muslim balkan slavs rather than ethnic turkish people orthodox southern slavs were also acting as akinjis and other light troops intended for pillaging in the territory of present-day hungary in 1686 the holy leagues army containing over 74,000 men from various nations reconquered buda from the turks after some more crushing defeats of the ottomans in the next few years the entire kingdom of hungary was removed from ottoman rule by 1718 the last raid into hungary by the ottoman vassals tatars from crimea took place in 1717 the constrained habsburg counter-reformation efforts in the 17th century reconverted the majority of the kingdom to catholicism the ethnic composition of hungary was fundamentally changed as a consequence of the prolonged warfare with the turks a large part of the country became devastated population growth was stunted and many smaller settlements perished the austrian-habsburg government settled large groups of serbs and other slavs in the depopulated south and settled germans called danube swabians in various areas but hungarians were not allowed to settle or re-settle in the south of the great plain


 from the 18th century to world war i 

between 1703 and 1711 there was a large-scale uprising led by francis ii rákóczi who after the dethronement of the habsburgs in 1707 at the diet of ónod took power provisionally as the ruling prince of hungary for the wartime period but refused the hungarian crown and the title king the uprisings lasted for years the hungarian kuruc army although took over most of the country lost the main battle at trencsén 1708 three years later because of the growing desertion defetism and moreal decline the kuruc forces finally surrendered

during the napoleonic wars and afterwards the hungarian diet had not convened for decades in the 1820s the emperor was forced to convene the diet which marked the beginning of a reform period 1825–1848 hungarian reformkor count istván széchenyi one of the most prominent statesmen of the country recognized the urgent need of modernization and his message got through the hungarian parliament was reconvened in 1825 to handle financial needs a liberal party emerged and focused on providing for the peasantry lajos kossuth – a famous journalist at that time – emerged as leader of the lower gentry in the parliament a remarkable upswing started as the nation concentrated its forces on modernization even though the habsburg monarchs obstructed all important liberal laws relating to civil and political rights and economic reforms many reformers lajos kossuth mihály táncsics were imprisoned by the authorities

on 15 march 1848 mass demonstrations in pest and buda enabled hungarian reformists to push through a list of 12 demands under governor and president lajos kossuth and the first prime minister lajos batthyány the house of habsburg was dethroned
the habsburg ruler and his advisors skillfully manipulated the croatian serbian and romanian peasantry led by priests and officers firmly loyal to the habsburgs and induced them to rebel against the hungarian government though the hungarians were supported by the vast majority of the slovak german and rusyn nationalities and by all the jews of the kingdom as well as by a large number of polish austrian and italian volunteers in july 1849 the hungarian parliament proclaimed and enacted the first laws of ethnic and minority rights in the world many members of the nationalities gained the coveted highest positions within the hungarian army like general jános damjanich an ethnic serb who became a hungarian national hero through his command of the 3rd hungarian army corps or józef bem who was polish and also became a national hero in hungary initially the hungarian forces honvédség defeated austrian armies to counter the successes of the hungarian revolutionary army habsburg emperor franz joseph i asked for help from the gendarme of europe czar nicholas i whose russian armies invaded hungary this made artúr görgey surrender in august 1849 the leader of the austrian army julius jacob von haynau became governor of hungary for a few months and ordered the execution of the 13 martyrs of arad leaders of the hungarian army and prime minister batthyány in october 1849 lajos kossuth escaped into exile following the war of 1848 – 1849 the whole country was in passive resistance

because of external and internal problems reforms seemed inevitable and major military defeats of austria forced the habsburgs to negotiate the austro-hungarian compromise of 1867 by which the dual monarchy of austria–hungary was formed this empire had the second largest area in europe after the russian empire and it was the third most populous after russia and the german empire the two realms were governed separately by two parliaments from two capital cities with a common monarch and common external and military policies economically the empire was a customs union the old hungarian constitution was restored and franz joseph i was crowned as king of hungary the era witnessed impressive economic development the formerly backward hungarian economy became relatively modern and industrialized by the turn of the 20th century although agriculture remained dominant until 1890 in 1873 the old capital buda and óbuda were officially united with pest thus creating the new metropolis of budapest many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of hungary were established during this period
after the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand in sarajevo the hungarian prime minister istván tisza and his cabinet tried to avoid the outbreak and escalating of a war in europe but their diplomatic efforts were unsuccessful austria–hungary drafted 9 million fighting forces 7.8 million soldiers in world war i over 4 million from the kingdom of hungary on the side of germany bulgaria and turkey the troops raised in the kingdom of hungary spent little time defending the actual territory of hungary with the exceptions of the brusilov offensive in june 1916 and a few months later when the romanian army made an attack into transylvania both of which were repelled in comparison of the total army hungarys loss ratio was more than any other nations of austria-hungary the central powers conquered serbia romania declared war the central powers conquered southern romania and the romanian capital bucharest in 1916 emperor franz joseph died and the new monarch charles iv sympathized with the pacifists with great difficulty the central powers stopped and repelled the attacks of the russian empire

the eastern front of the allied entente powers completely collapsed the austro-hungarian empire then withdrew from all defeated countries on the italian front the austro-hungarian army made no progress against italy after january 1918 despite great eastern successes germany suffered complete defeat on the more important western front by 1918 the economic situation had deteriorated strikes in factories were organized by leftist and pacifist movements and uprisings in the army had become commonplace in the capital cities the austrian and hungarian leftist liberal movements the maverick parties and their leaders supported the separatism of ethnic minorities austria-hungary signed a general armistice in padua on 3 november 1918 in october 1918 hungarys union with austria was dissolved


 between the world wars 1918–1941 

following the first world war hungary underwent a period of profound political upheaval beginning with the aster revolution in 1918 which brought the social-democratic mihály károlyi to power as prime minister károlyi dissolved the union with austria and disarmed the hungarian army leaving the country without any national defense the little entente sensing an opportunity invaded the country from three sides—romania invaded transylvania czechoslovakia annexed upper hungary todays slovakia and a joint serb-french coalition annexed vojvodina and other southern regions in march 1919 communists led by béla kun ousted the károlyi government and proclaimed the hungarian soviet republic tanácsköztársaság followed by a thorough red terror campaign despite some successes on the czechoslovak front kuns forces were ultimately unable to resist the romanian invasion by august 1919 romanian troops occupied budapest and ousted kun

in november 1919 rightist forces led by former austro-hungarian admiral miklós horthy entered budapest exhausted by the war and its aftermath the populace accepted horthys leadership in january 1920 parliamentary elections were held and horthy was proclaimed regent of the reestablished kingdom of hungary inaugurating the so-called horthy era horthy-kor the new government worked quickly to normalize foreign relations while turning a blind eye to a white terror that swept through the countryside extrajudicial killings of suspected communists and jews lasted well into 1920 on june 4 of that year the treaty of trianon established new borders for hungary the country lost 71% of its territory and 66% of its antebellum population as well as many sources of raw materials and its sole port fiume though the revision of the treaty quickly rose to the top of the national political agenda the horthy government was not willing to resort to military intervention to do so
the initial years of the horthy regime were occupied by putsch attempts by charles iv the austro-hungarian pretender continued suppression of communists and a migration crisis triggered by the trianon territorial changes though free elections continued horthys personality and those of his personally selected prime ministers dominated the political scene the governments actions continued to drift right with the passage of antisemitic laws and due to the continued isolation of the little entente economic and then political gravitation toward italy and germany the great depression further exacerbated the situation and the popularity of fascist politicians such as gyula gömbös and ferenc szálasi promising economic and social recovery rose
horthys nationalist agenda reached its apogee in 1938 and 1940 when the nazis rewarded hungarys staunchly pro-germany foreign policy in the first and second vienna awards respectively peacefully restoring ethnic-hungarian-majority areas lost after trianon in 1939 hungary regained further territory from czechoslovakia through force hungary formally joined the axis powers on 20 november 1940 and in 1941 participated in the invasion of yugoslavia gaining some of its former territories in the south


 world war ii 1941–1945 

hungary formally entered world war ii as an axis power on 26 june 1941 declaring war on the soviet union after unidentified planes bombed kassa munkács and rahó hungarian troops fought on the eastern front for two years despite some early successes the hungarian government began seeking a secret peace pact with the allies after the second army suffered catastrophic losses at the river don in january 1943 learning of the planned defection german troops occupied hungary on 19 march 1944 to guarantee horthys compliance in october as the soviet front approached and the hungarian government made further efforts to disengage from the war german troops ousted horthy and installed a puppet government under szálasis fascist arrow cross party szálasi pledged all the countrys capabilities in service of the german war machine by october 1944 the soviets had reached the river tisza and despite some losses succeeded in encircling and besieging budapest in december

after german occupation hungary participated in the holocaust during the german occupation in may–june 1944 the arrow cross and hungarian police deported nearly 440,000 jews mainly to auschwitz nearly all of them were murdered the swedish diplomat raoul wallenberg managed to save a considerable number of hungarian jews by giving them swedish passports rezső kasztner one of the leaders of the hungarian aid and rescue committee bribed senior ss officers such as adolf eichmann to allow some jews to escape the horthy governments complicity in the holocaust remains a point of controversy and contention

the war left hungary devastated destroying over 60% of the economy and causing significant loss of life in addition to the over 600,000 hungarian jews killed as many as 280,000 other hungarians were raped murdered and executed or deported for slave labor by czechoslovaks soviet red army troops and yugoslavson 13 february 1945 budapest surrendered by april german troops left the country under soviet military occupation 200,000 hungarians were expelled from czechoslovakia in exchange for 70,000 slovaks living in hungary 202,000 ethnic germans were expelled to germany and through the 1947 paris peace treaties hungary was again reduced to its immediate post-trianon borders


 communism 1945–1989 

following the defeat of nazi germany hungary became a satellite state of the soviet union the soviet leadership selected mátyás rákosi to front the stalinization of the country and rákosi de facto ruled hungary from 1949 to 1956 his governments policies of militarization industrialization collectivization and war compensation led to a severe decline in living standards in imitation of stalins kgb the rákosi government established a secret political police the ávh to enforce the new regime in the ensuing purges approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals were imprisoned or executed from 1948 to 1956 many freethinkers democrats and horthy-era dignitaries were secretly arrested and extrajudicially interned in domestic and foreign gulags some 600,000 hungarians were deported to soviet labor camps where at least 200,000 died

after stalins death in 1953 the soviet union pursued a program of destalinization that was inimical to rákosi leading to his deposition the following political cooling saw the ascent of imre nagy to the premiership and the growing interest of students and intellectuals in political life nagy promised market liberalization and political openness while rákosi opposed both vigorously rákosi eventually managed to discredit nagy and replace him with the more hard-line ernő gerő hungary joined the warsaw pact in may 1955 as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by soviet soldiers and secret police and rallies throughout the country on 23 october 1956 protesters took to the streets in budapest initiating the 1956 revolution in an effort to quell the chaos nagy returned as premier promised free elections and took hungary out of the warsaw pact
the violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the soviet army and the ávh the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought soviet tanks using molotov cocktails and machine-pistols though the preponderance of the soviets was immense they suffered heavy losses and by 30 october 1956 most soviet troops had withdrawn from budapest to garrison the countryside for a time the soviet leadership was unsure how to respond to developments in hungary but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilization of the soviet bloc on 4 november reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the soviet union nearly 20,000 hungarians were killed resisting the intervention while an additional 21,600 were imprisoned afterwards for political reasons some 13,000 were interned and 230 brought to trial and executed nagy was secretly tried found guilty sentenced to death and executed by hanging in june 1958 because borders were briefly opened nearly a quarter of a million people fled the country by the time the revolution was suppressed


 kádár era 1956–1988 

after a second briefer period of soviet military occupation jános kádár nagys former minister of state was chosen by the soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling socialist workers party mszmp kádár quickly normalized the situation in 1963 the government granted a general amnesty and released the majority of those imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising kádár proclaimed a new policy line according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the socialist regime as a fact of life in many speeches he described this as those who are not against us are with us kádár introduced new planning priorities in the economy such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system háztáji gazdálkodás the living standard rose as consumer good and food production took precedence over military production which was reduced to one tenth of pre-revolutionary levels
in 1968 the new economic mechanism nem introduced free-market elements into socialist command economy from the 1960s through the late 1980s hungary was often referred to as the happiest barrack within the eastern bloc during the latter part of the cold war hungarys gdp per capita was fourth only to east germany czechoslovakia and the soviet union itself as a result of this relatively high standard of living a more liberalized economy a less censored press and less restricted travel rights hungary was generally considered one of the more liberal countries in which to live in central europe during communism in the 1980s however living standards steeply declined again due to a worldwide recession to which communism was unable to respond by the time kádár died in 1989 the soviet union was in steep decline and a younger generation of reformists saw liberalization as the solution to economic and social issues


 third republic 1989–present 

hungarys transition from communism to democracy and capitalism rendszerváltás regime change was peaceful and prompted by economic stagnation domestic political pressure and changing relations with other warsaw pact countries although the mszmp began round table talks with various opposition groups in march 1989 the reburial of imre nagy as a revolutionary martyr that june is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in hungary over 100,000 people attended the budapest ceremony without any significant government interference and many speakers openly called for soviet troops to leave the country free elections were held in may 1990 and the hungarian democratic forum a major conservative opposition group was elected to the head of a coalition government józsef antall became the first democratically elected prime minister since world war ii
with the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatization in 1991 hungary was affected by a severe economic recession the antall governments austerity measures proved unpopular and the communist partys legal and political heir the socialist party won the subsequent 1994 elections this abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in 1998 and 2002 each electoral cycle the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected like most other post-communist european states however hungary broadly pursued an integrationist agenda joining nato in 1999 and the european union in 2004 as a nato member hungary was involved in the yugoslav wars
in 2006 major protests erupted after it leaked that socialist pm ferenc gyurcsánys had claimed in a private speech that his party lied to win the recent elections the popularity of left-wing parties plummeted in the ensuing political upheaval and in 2010 viktor orbáns national-conservative fidesz was elected to a parliamentary supermajority the legislature consequently approved a new constitution among other sweeping governmental and legal changes although these developments were met with and still engender controversy fidesz secured a second parliamentary supermajority in 2014 and a third in 2018
in september 2018 the european parliament voted to act against hungary under the terms of article 7 of the treaty on european union proponents of the vote claimed that the hungarian government posed a systematic threat to democracy and the rule of law the vote was carried with the support of 448 meps narrowly clearing the two-thirds majority required the vote marked the first the european parliament had triggered an article 7 procedure against an eu member state péter szijjártó the hungarian foreign minister described the vote as petty revenge which had been provoked by hungarys tough anti-migration policies szijjártó alleged that the vote was fraudulent because abstentions were not counted which made it easier to reach the two-thirds majority required to pass the vote
