theia  is a hypothesized ancient planet in the early solar system that according to the giant impact hypothesis collided with gaia the early earth around 4.5 billion years ago according to the hypothesis theia was an earth trojan about the size of mars with a diameter of about 6,102 km 3,792 miles geologist edward young of the university of california los angeles drawing on an analysis of rocks collected by apollo missions 12 15 and 17 proposes that theia collided head-on with earth in contrast to the previous theory that suggested a glancing impact models of the impact indicate that theias debris gathered around earth to form the early moon
some scientists think the material thrown into orbit originally formed two moons that later merged to form the single moon we know today the theia hypothesis also explains why earths core is larger than would be expected for a body its size according to the hypothesis theias core and mantle mixed with earths


 orbit 
theia is thought to have orbited in the l4 or l5 configuration presented by the earth–sun system where it would tend to remain in that case it would have grown potentially to a size comparable to mars gravitational perturbations by venus could have eventually put it onto a collision course with the earth


 name 
theia was named for the titaness theia who in greek mythology was the mother of selene the goddess of the moon which parallels the planet theias collision with the early earth that is theorized to have created the moonan alternative name orpheus is also used


 collision 

according to the giant-impact hypothesis theia orbited the sun nearly along the orbit of the proto-earth by staying close to one or the other of the sun–earth systems two more stable lagrangian points ie either l4 or l5 
theia was eventually perturbed away from that relationship by the gravitational influence of jupiter andor venus resulting in a collision between theia and earthcomputer simulations suggest that theia was traveling no faster than 4 kms when it struck earth at an estimated 45 degree angle
originally the hypothesis supposed that theia had struck earth with a glancing blow and ejected many pieces of both the proto-earth and theia those pieces either forming one body that became the moon or forming two moons that eventually merged to form the moon such accounts assumed that if theia had struck the proto-earth head-on both planets would have been destroyed creating a short-lived second asteroid belt between the orbits of venus and mars
in contrast evidence published in january 2016 suggests that the impact was indeed a head-on collision and that theias remains can be found both in the earth and the moon


 hypotheses 

from the beginning of modern astronomy there have been at least four hypotheses for the origin of the moon

that a single body split into earth and the moon
that the moon was captured by earths gravity as most of the outer planets smaller moons were captured
that earth and the moon formed at the same time when the protoplanetary disk accreted and
that the theia scenario occurredthe lunar rock samples retrieved by apollo astronauts were found to be very similar in composition to earths crust and so were likely removed from earth in some violent event
