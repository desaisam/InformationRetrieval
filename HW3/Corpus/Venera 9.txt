venera 9 russian венера-9 meaning venus 9 manufacturers designation 4v-1 no 660 was a soviet unmanned space mission to venus it consisted of an orbiter and a lander it was launched on june 8 1975 at 023800 utc and had a mass of 4,936 kilograms 10,882 lb the orbiter was the first spacecraft to orbit venus while the lander was the first to return images from the surface of another planet


 orbiter 
the orbiter entered venus orbit on october 20 1975 its mission was to act as a communications relay for the lander and to explore cloud layers and atmospheric parameters with several instruments and experiments it performed 17 survey missions from october 26 1975 to december 25 1975
the orbiter consisted of a cylinder with two solar panel wings and a high gain parabolic antenna attached to the curved surface a bell-shaped unit holding propulsion systems was attached to the bottom of the cylinder and mounted on top was a 2.4-metre 7.9 ft sphere which held the lander 


 orbiter design 
the instruments comprising the orbiter included

1.6-2.8 μm ir spectrometer
8-28 μm ir radiometer
352 nm uv photometer
2 photo-polarimeters 335-800 nm
300-800 nm spectrometer
lyman-α alpha hd spectrometer
bistatic radar mapping
cm dm radio occultations
triaxial magnetometer
345-380 nm uv camera
355-445 nm camera
6 electrostatic analyzers
2 modulation ion traps
low-energy proton  alpha detector
low-energy electron detector
3 semiconductor counters
2 gas-discharge counters
cherenkov detector


 lander 
the lander was encased in a spherical shell before landing to help protect it from the heat of entry as it slowed from 10.7 kms to 150 ms  this sphere was then separated with explosive bolts and a three-domed parachute was deployed which slowed the lander further to 50 ms at an altitude of 63 km above the planet
the descent through the cloud layer took about 20 minutes during which time the lander took measurements of the atmosphere and radioed the information to the orbiter  to minimize lander damage in the hot atmosphere the parachute was released at an altitude of 50 km and the ring-shaped aerodynamic shield provided braking  the venusian atmosphere is so dense near the surface that this shield provided a descent rate of 7 ms as the lander touched down  the landing device a hollow ring surrounding the lower part of the lander was partly crushed upon touchdown to take up most of the landing impact
on october 20 1975 the lander spacecraft separated from the orbiter and landing was made with the sun near zenith at 0513 utc on october 22 venera 9 landed within a 150 km 93 mi radius of 31.01°n 291.64°e﻿  31.01 291.64 near beta regio on a steep 20° slope covered with boulders suspected to be the slope of the tectonic rift valley aikhylu chasma the entry sphere weighed 1,560 kg 3,440 lb and the surface payload was 660 kg 1,455 lbit was the first spacecraft to return an image from the surface of another planet  many of the instruments began working immediately after touchdown and the cameras were operational 2 minutes later  these instruments revealed a smooth surface with numerous stones  the lander measured a light level of 14,000 lux similar to that of earth in full daylight but no direct sunshine
a system of circulating fluid was used to distribute the heat load this system plus pre-cooling prior to entry permitted operation of the lander for 53 minutes after landing at which time radio contact with the orbiter was lost as the orbiter moved out of radio range during descent heat dissipation and deceleration were accomplished sequentially by protective hemispheric shells three parachutes a disc-shaped drag brake and a compressible metal doughnut-shaped landing cushion the landing was about 2,200 km 1,400 mi from the venera 10 landing site
venera 9 measured clouds that were 30–40 km 19–25 mi thick with bases at 30–35 km 19–22 mi altitude it also measured atmospheric chemicals including hydrochloric acid hydrofluoric acid bromine and iodine other measurements included surface pressure of about 9,100 kilopascals 90 atm temperature of 485 °c 905 °f and surface light levels comparable to those at earth mid-latitudes on a cloudy summer day venera 9 was the first probe to send back black and white television pictures from the venusian surface showing no shadows no apparent dust in the air and a variety of 30 to 40 cm 12 to 16 in rocks which were not eroded planned 360-degree panoramic pictures could not be taken because one of two camera lens covers failed to come off limiting pictures to 180 degrees this failure recurred with venera 10
