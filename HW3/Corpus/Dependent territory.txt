some political entities inhabit a special position guaranteed by international treaty or other agreement creating a certain level of autonomy eg differences in immigration rules these are sometimes considered or at least grouped with dependencies but are officially considered by their controlling states to be integral parts of the state examples are åland finland and hong kong china

 description 
three crown dependencies are in a form of association with the uk they are independently administrated jurisdictions although the british government is solely responsible for defence and international representation and has ultimate responsibility for ensuring good government they do not have diplomatic recognition as independent states but neither are they integrated into the uk nor the european union the uk parliament retains the ability to legislate for the crown dependencies even without agreement of their legislatures no crown dependency has representation in the uk parliament 
although british overseas territories bermuda and gibraltar have similar relationships to the uk as the crown dependencies while britain is officially responsible for defence and international representation these jurisdictions maintain their own militaries and have been granted limited diplomatic powers in addition to having internal self-government 
new zealand and its dependencies share the same governor-general and constitute one monarchic realm the cook islands and niue are officially termed associated states
puerto rico since 1952 and the northern mariana islands since 1986 are non-independent states freely associated with the united states the mutually negotiated covenant to establish a commonwealth of the northern mariana islands cnmi in political union with the united states was approved in 1976 the covenant was fully implemented november 3 1986 pursuant to presidential proclamation no 5564 which conferred united states citizenship on legally qualified cnmi residents under the constitution of puerto rico puerto rico is described as a commonwealth and puerto ricans have a degree of administrative autonomy similar to citizens of a us state puerto ricans were collectively made us citizens in 1917 as a result of the jones-shafroth act the commonly used name in spanish of the commonwealth of puerto rico estado libre asociado de puerto rico literally associated free state of puerto rico which sounds similar to free association particularly when loosely used in spanish is sometimes erroneously interpreted to mean that puerto ricos relationship with united states is based on a compact of free association and at other times erroneously held to mean that puerto ricos relationship with united states is based on an interstate compact this is a constant source of ambiguity and confusion when trying to define understand and explain puerto ricos political relationship with the united states for various reasons puerto ricos political status differs from that of the pacific islands that entered into compacts of free association with the united states as sovereign states these islands have full right to conduct their own foreign relations while the commonwealth of puerto rico has territorial status subject to united states congressional authority under the constitutions territory clause to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory… belonging to the united states puerto rico does not have the right to unilaterally declare independence and at the last referendum 1998 the narrow majority voted for none of the above which was a formally undefined alternative used by commonwealth supporters to express their desire for an enhanced commonwealth optionthis kind of relationship also can be found in the kingdom of the netherlands which is termed a federacy the european continental part is organized like a unitary state however the status of its caribbean countries aruba curaçao and sint maarten can be considered dependencies or “associated non-independent states”
the kingdom of denmark also operates in a similar manner another federacy the faroes and greenland are two self-governing territories or regions within the kingdom the relationship between denmark proper and these two territories is semi-officially termed the rigsfællesskabet “unity of the realm”
