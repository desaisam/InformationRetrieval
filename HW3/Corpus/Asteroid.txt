asteroids are minor planets especially of the inner solar system larger asteroids have also been called planetoids these terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the sun that did not resemble a planet-like disc and was not observed to have characteristics of an active comet such as a tail as minor planets in the outer solar system were discovered they were typically found to have volatile-rich surfaces similar to comets as a result they were often distinguished from objects found in the main asteroid belt in this article the term asteroid refers to the minor planets of the inner solar system including those co-orbital with jupiter
there exist millions of asteroids many thought to be the shattered remnants of planetesimals bodies within the young suns solar nebula that never grew large enough to become planets the vast majority of known asteroids orbit within the main asteroid belt located between the orbits of mars and jupiter or are co-orbital with jupiter the jupiter trojans however other orbital families exist with significant populations including the near-earth objects individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic spectra with the majority falling into three main groups c-type m-type and s-type these were named after and are generally identified with carbon-rich metallic and silicate stony compositions respectively the sizes of asteroids varies greatly the largest ceres is almost 1,000 km 625 mi across
asteroids are differentiated from comets and meteoroids in the case of comets the difference is one of composition while asteroids are mainly composed of mineral and rock comets are primarily composed of dust and ice furthermore asteroids formed closer to the sun preventing the development of cometary ice the difference between asteroids and meteoroids is mainly one of size meteoroids have a diameter of one meter or less whereas asteroids have a diameter of greater than one meter finally meteoroids can be composed of either cometary or asteroidal materialsonly one asteroid 4 vesta which has a relatively reflective surface is normally visible to the naked eye and this only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned rarely small asteroids passing close to earth may be visible to the naked eye for a short time as of  october 2017 the minor planet center had data on almost 745,000 objects in the inner and outer solar system of which almost 504,000 had enough information to be given numbered designationsthe united nations declared 30 june as international asteroid day to educate the public about asteroids the date of international asteroid day commemorates the anniversary of the tunguska asteroid impact over siberia russian federation on 30 june 1908in april 2018 the b612 foundation reported its 100 percent certain well be hit by a devastating asteroid but were not 100 percent sure when also in 2018 physicist stephen hawking
in his final book brief answers to the big questions considered an asteroid collision to be the biggest threat to the planet in june 2018 the us national science and technology council warned that america is unprepared for an asteroid impact event and has developed and released the national near-earth object preparedness strategy action plan to better prepare according to expert testimony in the united states congress in 2013 nasa would require at least five years of preparation before a mission to intercept an asteroid could be launched


 discovery 

the first asteroid to be discovered ceres was originally considered to be a new planet this was followed by the discovery of other similar bodies which with the equipment of the time appeared to be points of light like stars showing little or no planetary disc though readily distinguishable from stars due to their apparent motions this prompted the astronomer sir william herschel to propose the term asteroid coined in greek as ἀστεροειδήσ or asteroeidēs meaning star-like star-shaped and derived from the ancient greek ἀστήρ astēr star planet in the early second half of the nineteenth century the terms asteroid and planet not always qualified as minor were still used interchangeably overview of discovery timeline

 historical methods 
asteroid discovery methods have dramatically improved over the past two centuries
in the last years of the 18th century baron franz xaver von zach organized a group of 24 astronomers to search the sky for the missing planet predicted at about 2.8 au from the sun by the titius-bode law partly because of the discovery by sir william herschel in 1781 of the planet uranus at the distance predicted by the law this task required that hand-drawn sky charts be prepared for all stars in the zodiacal band down to an agreed-upon limit of faintness on subsequent nights the sky would be charted again and any moving object would hopefully be spotted the expected motion of the missing planet was about 30 seconds of arc per hour readily discernible by observers

the first object ceres was not discovered by a member of the group but rather by accident in 1801 by giuseppe piazzi director of the observatory of palermo in sicily he discovered a new star-like object in taurus and followed the displacement of this object during several nights later that year carl friedrich gauss used these observations to calculate the orbit of this unknown object which was found to be between the planets mars and jupiter piazzi named it after ceres the roman goddess of agriculturethree other asteroids 2 pallas 3 juno and 4 vesta were discovered over the next few years with vesta found in 1807 after eight more years of fruitless searches most astronomers assumed that there were no more and abandoned any further searcheshowever karl ludwig hencke persisted and began searching for more asteroids in 1830 fifteen years later he found 5 astraea the first new asteroid in 38 years he also found 6 hebe less than two years later after this other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that except the wartime years 1944 and 1945 notable asteroid hunters of this early era were j r hind annibale de gasparis robert luther h m s goldschmidt jean chacornac james ferguson norman robert pogson e w tempel j c watson c h f peters a borrelly j palisa the henry brothers and auguste charlois
in 1891 max wolf pioneered the use of astrophotography to detect asteroids which appeared as short streaks on long-exposure photographic plates this dramatically increased the rate of detection compared with earlier visual methods wolf alone discovered 248 asteroids beginning with 323 brucia whereas only slightly more than 300 had been discovered up to that point it was known that there were many more but most astronomers did not bother with them calling them vermin of the skies a phrase variously attributed to eduard suess and edmund weiss even a century later only a few thousand asteroids were identified numbered and named


 manual methods of the 1900s and modern reporting 
until 1998 asteroids were discovered by a four-step process first a region of the sky was photographed by a wide-field telescope or astrograph pairs of photographs were taken typically one hour apart multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days second the two films or plates of the same region were viewed under a stereoscope any body in orbit around the sun would move slightly between the pair of films under the stereoscope the image of the body would seem to float slightly above the background of stars third once a moving body was identified its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope the location would be measured relative to known star locationsthese first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery the observer has only found an apparition which gets a provisional designation made up of the year of discovery a letter representing the half-month of discovery and finally a letter and a number indicating the discoverys sequential number example 1998 fj74
the last step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to the minor planet center where computer programs determine whether an apparition ties together earlier apparitions into a single orbit if so the object receives a catalogue number and the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer and granted the honor of naming the object subject to the approval of the international astronomical union


 computerized methods 

there is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross earths and that could given enough time collide with earth see earth-crosser asteroids the three most important groups of near-earth asteroids are the apollos amors and atens various asteroid deflection strategies have been proposed as early as the 1960s
the near-earth asteroid 433 eros had been discovered as long ago as 1898 and the 1930s brought a flurry of similar objects in order of discovery these were 1221 amor 1862 apollo 2101 adonis and finally 69230 hermes which approached within 0.005 au of earth in 1937 astronomers began to realize the possibilities of earth impact
two events in later decades increased the alarm the increasing acceptance of the alvarez hypothesis that an impact event resulted in the cretaceous–paleogene extinction and the 1994 observation of comet shoemaker-levy 9 crashing into jupiter the us military also declassified the information that its military satellites built to detect nuclear explosions had detected hundreds of upper-atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to ten meters across
all these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient surveys that consist of charge-coupled device ccd cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes as of  2011 it was estimated that 89% to 96% of near-earth asteroids one kilometer or larger in diameter had been discovered a list of teams using such systems includes

 terminology 

traditionally small bodies orbiting the sun were classified as comets asteroids or meteoroids with anything smaller than one  meter across being called a meteoroid beech and steels 1995 paper proposed a meteoroid definition including size limits the term asteroid from the greek word for star-like never had a formal definition with the broader term minor planet being preferred by the international astronomical union
however following the discovery of asteroids below ten meters in size rubin and grossmans 2010 paper revised the previous definition of meteoroid to objects between 10 μm and 1 meter in size in order to maintain the distinction between asteroids and meteoroids the smallest asteroids discovered based on absolute magnitude h are 2008 ts26 with h  33.2 and 2011 cq1 with h  32.1 both with an estimated size of about 1 meterin 2006 the term small solar system body was also introduced to cover both most minor planets and comets other languages prefer planetoid greek for planet-like and this term is occasionally used in english especially for larger minor planets such as the dwarf planets as well as an alternative for asteroids since they are not star-like the word planetesimal has a similar meaning but refers specifically to the small building blocks of the planets that existed when the solar system was forming the term planetule was coined by the geologist william daniel conybeare to describe minor planets but is not in common use the three largest objects in the asteroid belt ceres pallas and vesta grew to the stage of protoplanets ceres is a dwarf planet the only one in the inner solar system
when found asteroids were seen as a class of objects distinct from comets and there was no unified term for the two until small solar system body was coined in 2006 the main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to sublimation of near surface ices by solar radiation a few objects have ended up being dual-listed because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity conversely some perhaps all comets are eventually depleted of their surface volatile ices and become asteroid-like a further distinction is that comets typically have more eccentric orbits than most asteroids most asteroids with notably eccentric orbits are probably dormant or extinct cometsfor almost two centuries from the discovery of ceres in 1801 until the discovery of the first centaur chiron in 1977 all known asteroids spent most of their time at or within the orbit of jupiter though a few such as hidalgo ventured far beyond jupiter for part of their orbit those located between the orbits of mars and jupiter were known for many years simply as the asteroids when astronomers started finding more small bodies that permanently resided further out than jupiter now called centaurs they numbered them among the traditional asteroids though there was debate over whether they should be considered asteroids or as a new type of object then when the first trans-neptunian object other than pluto albion was discovered in 1992 and especially when large numbers of similar objects started turning up new terms were invented to sidestep the issue kuiper-belt object trans-neptunian object scattered-disc object and so on these inhabit the cold outer reaches of the solar system where ices remain solid and comet-like bodies are not expected to exhibit much cometary activity if centaurs or trans-neptunian objects were to venture close to the sun their volatile ices would sublimate and traditional approaches would classify them as comets and not asteroids
the innermost of these are the kuiper-belt objects called objects partly to avoid the need to classify them as asteroids or comets they are thought to be predominantly comet-like in composition though some may be more akin to asteroids furthermore most do not have the highly eccentric orbits associated with comets and the ones so far discovered are larger than traditional comet nuclei the much more distant oort cloud is hypothesized to be the main reservoir of dormant comets other recent observations such as the analysis of the cometary dust collected by the stardust probe are increasingly blurring the distinction between comets and asteroids suggesting a continuum between asteroids and comets rather than a sharp dividing linethe minor planets beyond jupiters orbit are sometimes also called asteroids especially in popular presentations however it is becoming increasingly common for the term asteroid to be restricted to minor planets of the inner solar system therefore this article will restrict itself for the most part to the classical asteroids objects of the asteroid belt jupiter trojans and near-earth objects
when the iau introduced the class small solar system bodies in 2006 to include most objects previously classified as minor planets and comets they created the class of dwarf planets for the largest minor planets – those that have enough mass to have become ellipsoidal under their own gravity according to the iau the term minor planet may still be used but generally the term small solar system body will be preferred currently only the largest object in the asteroid belt ceres at about 975 km 606 mi across has been placed in the dwarf planet category


 formation 

it is thought that planetesimals in the asteroid belt evolved much like the rest of the solar nebula until jupiter neared its current mass at which point excitation from orbital resonances with jupiter ejected over 99% of planetesimals in the belt simulations and a discontinuity in spin rate and spectral properties suggest that asteroids larger than approximately 120 km 75 mi in diameter accreted during that early era whereas smaller bodies are fragments from collisions between asteroids during or after the jovian disruption ceres and vesta grew large enough to melt and differentiate with heavy metallic elements sinking to the core leaving rocky minerals in the crustin the nice model many kuiper-belt objects are captured in the outer asteroid belt at distances greater than 2.6 au most were later ejected by jupiter but those that remained may be the d-type asteroids and possibly include ceres


 distribution within the solar system 

various dynamical groups of asteroids have been discovered orbiting in the inner solar system their orbits are perturbed by the gravity of other bodies in the solar system and by the yarkovsky effect significant populations include


 asteroid belt 

the majority of known asteroids orbit within the asteroid belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter generally in relatively low-eccentricity ie not very elongated orbits this belt is now estimated to contain between 1.1 and 1.9 million asteroids larger than 1 km 0.6 mi in diameter and millions of smaller ones these asteroids may be remnants of the protoplanetary disk and in this region the accretion of planetesimals into planets during the formative period of the solar system was prevented by large gravitational perturbations by jupiter


 trojans 

trojans are populations that share an orbit with a larger planet or moon but do not collide with it because they orbit in one of the two lagrangian points of stability l4 and l5 which lie 60° ahead of and behind the larger body
the most significant population of trojans are the jupiter trojans although fewer jupiter trojans have been discovered as of  2010 it is thought that they are as numerous as the asteroids in the asteroid belt trojans have been found in the orbits of other planets including venus earth mars uranus and neptune


 near-earth asteroids 

near-earth asteroids or neas are asteroids that have orbits that pass close to that of earth asteroids that actually cross earths orbital path are known as earth-crossers as of  june 2016 14,464 near-earth asteroids are known and the number over one kilometer in diameter is estimated to be 900–1,000


 characteristics 


 size distribution 

asteroids vary greatly in size from almost 1000 km for the largest down to rocks just 1 meter across the three largest are very much like miniature planets they are roughly spherical have at least partly differentiated interiors and are thought to be surviving protoplanets the vast majority however are much smaller and are irregularly shaped they are thought to be either surviving planetesimals or fragments of larger bodies
the dwarf planet ceres is by far the largest asteroid with a diameter of 975 km 606 mi the next largest are 4 vesta and 2 pallas both with diameters of just over 500 km 300 mi vesta is the only main-belt asteroid that can on occasion be visible to the naked eye on some rare occasions a near-earth asteroid may briefly become visible without technical aid see 99942 apophis
the mass of all the objects of the asteroid belt lying between the orbits of mars and jupiter is estimated to be about 2.8–3.2×1021 kg or about 4% of the mass of the moon of this ceres comprises 0.95×1021 kg a third of the total adding in the next three most massive objects vesta 9 pallas 7 and hygiea 3 brings this figure up to 51 whereas the three after that 511 davida 1.2 704 interamnia 1.0 and 52 europa 0.9 only add another 3% to the total mass the number of asteroids then increases rapidly as their individual masses decrease
the number of asteroids decreases markedly with size although this generally follows a power law there are bumps at 5 km and 100 km where more asteroids than expected from a logarithmic distribution are found


 largest asteroids 

although their location in the asteroid belt excludes them from planet status the three largest objects ceres vesta and pallas are intact protoplanets that share many characteristics common to planets and are atypical compared to the majority of potato-shaped asteroids the fourth largest asteroid hygiea has an undifferentiated interior like the majority of asteroids between them the four largest asteroids constitute half the mass of the asteroid belt
ceres is the only asteroid with a fully ellipsoidal shape and hence the only one that is a dwarf planet it has a much higher absolute magnitude than the other asteroids of around 3.32 and may possess a surface layer of ice like the planets ceres is differentiated it has a crust a mantle and a core no meteorites from ceres have been found on earth
vesta too has a differentiated interior though it formed inside the solar systems frost line and so is devoid of water its composition is mainly of basaltic rock such as olivine aside from the large crater at its southern pole rheasilvia vesta also has an ellipsoidal shape vesta is the parent body of the vestian family and other v-type asteroids and is the source of the hed meteorites which constitute 5% of all meteorites on earth
pallas is unusual in that like uranus it rotates on its side with its axis of rotation tilted at high angles to its orbital plane its composition is similar to that of ceres high in carbon and silicon and perhaps partially differentiated pallas is the parent body of the palladian family of asteroids
hygiea is the largest carbonaceous asteroid and unlike the other largest asteroids lies relatively close to the plane of the ecliptic it is the largest member and presumed parent body of the hygiean family of asteroids


 rotation 
measurements of the rotation rates of large asteroids in the asteroid belt show that there is an upper limit very few asteroids with a diameter larger than 100 meters have a rotation period smaller than 2.2 hours for asteroids rotating faster than approximately this rate the inertial force at the surface is greater than the gravitational force so any loose surface material would be flung out however a solid object should be able to rotate much more rapidly this suggests that most asteroids with a diameter over 100 meters are rubble piles formed through accumulation of debris after collisions between asteroids


 composition 

the physical composition of asteroids is varied and in most cases poorly understood ceres appears to be composed of a rocky core covered by an icy mantle where vesta is thought to have a nickel-iron core olivine mantle and basaltic crust 10 hygiea however which appears to have a uniformly primitive composition of carbonaceous chondrite is thought to be the largest undifferentiated asteroid most of the smaller asteroids are thought to be piles of rubble held together loosely by gravity though the largest are probably solid some asteroids have moons or are co-orbiting binaries rubble piles moons binaries and scattered asteroid families are thought to be the results of collisions that disrupted a parent asteroid or possibly a planetasteroids contain traces of amino acids and other organic compounds and some speculate that asteroid impacts may have seeded the early earth with the chemicals necessary to initiate life or may have even brought life itself to earth also see panspermia in august 2011 a report based on nasa studies with meteorites found on earth was published suggesting dna and rna components adenine guanine and related organic molecules may have been formed on asteroids and comets in outer space

composition is calculated from three primary sources albedo surface spectrum and density the last can only be determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have so far every asteroid with moons has turned out to be a rubble pile a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume the investigated asteroids are as large as 280 km in diameter and include 121 hermione 268×186×183 km and 87 sylvia 384×262×232 km only half a dozen asteroids are larger than 87 sylvia though none of them have moons however some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive suggesting they may not have been disrupted and indeed 511 davida the same size as sylvia to within measurement error is estimated to be two and a half times as massive though this is highly uncertain the fact that such large asteroids as sylvia can be rubble piles presumably due to disruptive impacts has important consequences for the formation of the solar system computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge this means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quicklyon 7 october 2009 the presence of water ice was confirmed on the surface of 24 themis using nasa’s infrared telescope facility the surface of the asteroid appears completely covered in ice as this ice layer is sublimating it may be getting replenished by a reservoir of ice under the surface organic compounds were also detected on the surface scientists hypothesize that some of the first water brought to earth was delivered by asteroid impacts after the collision that produced the moon the presence of ice on 24 themis supports this theoryin october 2013 water was detected on an extrasolar body for the first time on an asteroid orbiting the white dwarf gd 61 on 22 january 2014 european space agency esa scientists reported the detection for the first definitive time of water vapor on ceres the largest object in the asteroid belt the detection was made by using the far-infrared abilities of the herschel space observatory the finding is unexpected because comets not asteroids are typically considered to sprout jets and plumes according to one of the scientists the lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids in may 2016 significant asteroid data arising from the wide-field infrared survey explorer and neowise missions have been questioned although the early original criticism had not undergone peer review a more recent peer-reviewed study was subsequently published


 surface features 
most asteroids outside the big four ceres pallas vesta and hygiea are likely to be broadly similar in appearance if irregular in shape 50-km 31-mi 253 mathilde is a rubble pile saturated with craters with diameters the size of the asteroids radius and earth-based observations of 300-km 186-mi 511 davida one of the largest asteroids after the big four reveal a similarly angular profile suggesting it is also saturated with radius-size craters medium-sized asteroids such as mathilde and 243 ida that have been observed up close also reveal a deep regolith covering the surface of the big four pallas and hygiea are practically unknown vesta has compression fractures encircling a radius-size crater at its south pole but is otherwise a spheroid ceres seems quite different in the glimpses hubble has provided with surface features that are unlikely to be due to simple craters and impact basins but details will be expanded with the dawn spacecraft which entered ceres orbit on 6 march 2015


 color 
asteroids become darker and redder with age due to space weathering however evidence suggests most of the color change occurs rapidly in the first hundred thousands years limiting the usefulness of spectral measurement for determining the age of asteroids


 classification 

asteroids are commonly classified according to two criteria the characteristics of their orbits and features of their reflectance spectrum


 orbital classification 

many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics apart from the broadest divisions it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered groups are relatively loose dynamical associations whereas families are tighter and result from the catastrophic break-up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past families are more common and easier to identify within the main asteroid belt but several small families have been reported among the jupiter trojans main belt families were first recognized by kiyotsugu hirayama in 1918 and are often called hirayama families in his honor
about 30–35% of the bodies in the asteroid belt belong to dynamical families each thought to have a common origin in a past collision between asteroids a family has also been associated with the plutoid dwarf planet haumea


 quasi-satellites and horseshoe objects 
some asteroids have unusual horseshoe orbits that are co-orbital with earth or some other planet examples are 3753 cruithne and 2002 aa29 the first instance of this type of orbital arrangement was discovered between saturns moons epimetheus and janus
sometimes these horseshoe objects temporarily become quasi-satellites for a few decades or a few hundred years before returning to their earlier status both earth and venus are known to have quasi-satellites
such objects if associated with earth or venus or even hypothetically mercury are a special class of aten asteroids however such objects could be associated with outer planets as well


 spectral classification 

in 1975 an asteroid taxonomic system based on color albedo and spectral shape was developed by clark r chapman david morrison and ben zellner these properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroids surface material the original classification system had three categories c-types for dark carbonaceous objects 75% of known asteroids s-types for stony silicaceous objects 17% of known asteroids and u for those that did not fit into either c or s this classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types the number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied
the two most widely used taxonomies now used are the tholen classification and smass classification the former was proposed in 1984 by david j tholen and was based on data collected from an eight-color asteroid survey performed in the 1980s this resulted in 14 asteroid categories in 2002 the small main-belt asteroid spectroscopic survey resulted in a modified version of the tholen taxonomy with 24 different types both systems have three broad categories of c s and x asteroids where x consists of mostly metallic asteroids such as the m-type there are also several smaller classesthe proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type some types are easier to detect than others biasing the totals


 problems 
originally spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroids composition however the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good and a variety of classifications are in use this has led to significant confusion although asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials


 naming 

a newly discovered asteroid is given a provisional designation such as 2002 at4 consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code indicating the half-month of discovery and the sequence within that half-month once an asteroids orbit has been confirmed it is given a number and later may also be given a name eg 433 eros the formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number eg 433 eros but dropping the parentheses is quite common informally it is common to drop the number altogether or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text in addition names can be proposed by the asteroids discoverer within guidelines established by the international astronomical union


 symbols 

the first asteroids to be discovered were assigned iconic symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate the planets by 1855 there were two dozen asteroid symbols which often occurred in multiple variants
in 1851 after the fifteenth asteroid eunomia had been discovered johann franz encke made a major change in the upcoming 1854 edition of the berliner astronomisches jahrbuch baj berlin astronomical yearbook he introduced a disk circle a traditional symbol for a star as the generic symbol for an asteroid the circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid although he assigned ① to the fifth astraea while continuing to designate the first four only with their existing iconic symbols the numbered-circle convention was quickly adopted by astronomers and the next asteroid to be discovered 16 psyche in 1852 was the first to be designated in that way at the time of its discovery however psyche was given an iconic symbol as well as were a few other asteroids discovered over the next few years see chart above 20 massalia was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol and no iconic symbols were created after the 1855 discovery of 37 fides that year astraeas number was increased to ⑤ but the first four asteroids ceres to vesta were not listed by their numbers until the 1867 edition the circle was soon abbreviated to a pair of parentheses which were easier to typeset and sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades leading to the modern convention


 exploration 

until the age of space travel objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery the best modern ground-based telescopes and the earth-orbiting hubble space telescope can resolve a small amount of detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids but even these mostly remain little more than fuzzy blobs limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their light curves their variation in brightness as they rotate and their spectral properties and asteroid sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occulations when an asteroid passes directly in front of a star radar imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters especially for near-earth asteroids in terms of delta-v and propellant requirements neos are more easily accessible than the moonthe first close-up photographs of asteroid-like objects were taken in 1971 when the mariner 9 probe imaged phobos and deimos the two small moons of mars which are probably captured asteroids these images revealed the irregular potato-like shapes of most asteroids as did later images from the voyager probes of the small moons of the gas giants
the first true asteroid to be photographed in close-up was 951 gaspra in 1991 followed in 1993 by 243 ida and its moon dactyl all of which were imaged by the galileo probe en route to jupiter
the first dedicated asteroid probe was near shoemaker which photographed 253 mathilde in 1997 before entering into orbit around 433 eros finally landing on its surface in 2001
other asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft en route to other destinations include 9969 braille by deep space 1 in 1999 and 5535 annefrank by stardust in 2002
from september to november 2005 the japanese hayabusa probe studied 25143 itokawa in detail and was plagued with difficulties but returned samples of its surface to earth on 13 june 2010
the european rosetta probe launched in 2004 flew by 2867 šteins in 2008 and 21 lutetia the third-largest asteroid visited to date in 2010
in september 2007 nasa launched the dawn spacecraft which orbited 4 vesta from july 2011 to september 2012 and has been orbiting the dwarf planet 1 ceres since 2015 4 vesta is the second-largest asteroid visited to date
on 13 december 2012 chinas lunar orbiter change 2 flew within 3.2 km 2 mi of the asteroid 4179 toutatis on an extended mission
the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa launched the hayabusa2 probe in december 2014 and plans to return samples from 162173 ryugu in december 2020
in june 2018 the us national science and technology council warned that america is unprepared for an asteroid impact event and has developed and released the national near-earth object preparedness strategy action plan to better prepare

in may 2011 nasa selected the osiris-rex sample return mission to asteroid 101955 bennu it launched on september 8 2016 its arrival at bennu is planned for december 2018 but by that fall it was close enough to image the asteroid in reasonable detail


 planned and future missions 

in early 2013 nasa announced the planning stages of a mission to capture a near-earth asteroid and move it into lunar orbit where it could possibly be visited by astronauts and later impacted into the moon on 19 june 2014 nasa reported that asteroid 2011 md was a prime candidate for capture by a robotic mission perhaps in the early 2020sit has been suggested that asteroids might be used as a source of materials that may be rare or exhausted on earth asteroid mining or materials for constructing space habitats see colonization of the asteroids materials that are heavy and expensive to launch from earth may someday be mined from asteroids and used for space manufacturing and construction
in the us discovery program the psyche spacecraft proposal to 16 psyche and lucy spacecraft to jupiter trojans made it to the semifinalist stage of mission selection
in january 2017 lucy and  psyche mission were both selected as nasas discovery program missions 13 and 14 respectively

 fiction 

asteroids and the asteroid belt are a staple of science fiction stories asteroids play several potential roles in science fiction as places human beings might colonize resources for extracting minerals hazards encountered by spacecraft traveling between two other points and as a threat to life on earth or other inhabited planets dwarf planets and natural satellites by potential impact
