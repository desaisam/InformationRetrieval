289pblanpain formerly d1819 w1 blanpain is a short-period comet that was discovered by jean-jacques blanpain on november 28 1819 blanpain described the comet as having a very small and confused nucleus  another independent discovery was made on december 5 of that year by j l pons following this the comet was lost and was given the designation d disappeared or dead however in 2003 the orbital elements of newly discovered asteroid 2003 wy25 were calculated by marco micheli and others to be a probable match for the lost comet  further observations of the asteroid in 2005 by david jewitt using the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope on mauna kea appeared to reveal a faint coma which supports the theory that 2003 wy25 is the lost comet or a part of it  the comet was officially established as periodic comet 289p in july 2013 after being rediscovered by the pan-starrs survey during an outburst event289p will be best viewed near and after the 2019-dec-20 perihelion passage


 source of phoenicids 
comet d1819 w1 has been proposed as the probable source of the phoenicid meteor stream since the first observation of a phoenicids meteor storm in 1956  analysis of the orbits of asteroid 2003 wy25 have supported this conjecture and it is thought likely that the comet was already breaking up at the time of its 1819 return the comet currently has an earth-moid of 0.015 au 2,200,000 km 1,400,000 mi
