the constellation program was nasas planned future human spaceflight program between 2005 and 2009 which aimed to develop a new crewed spacecraft orion and a pair of launchers ares i and ares v to continue servicing the international space station and return to the moon
as of 2009 a single unmanned suborbital launch test ares i-x had been flown with crewed missions anticipated to begin between 2014 when an unmanned mission was indeed launched and 2017-19 according to the independent augustine commission on february 1 2010 president obama announced that he intended to cancel the program with the us 2011 fiscal year budget a revised proposal in april confirmed that the orion spacecraft would be retained for future mission beyond low earth orbit with the ares launchers redeveloped into the space launch system however the constellation program itself was cancelled with low-earth-orbit operations transferred to the commercial crew development program which itself would not begin launches until 2018 at the earliest


 development of mission plans 
in october 2006 nasa released a draft schedule of all planned nasa project constellation missions through 2019 this document included descriptions of a series of proposed vehicle test missions in july 2007 the schedule was reviewed in january 2008 the schedule was again reviewed the most recent published set of milestones is from february 2009 also an independent assessment by the review of united states human space flight plans committee in october 2009 found that under nasas then-current plans and budget the ares i would not be ready to launch until 2017-2019 with the ares v not available until the late 2020s
on october 11 2010 the constellation program was cancelled ending development of the altair ares i and ares v the orion crew exploration vehicle was renamed the orion multi-purpose crew vehicle mpcv to be launched on the space launch system


 constellation missions 
after cancellation two of the original launches took place anyway


 ascent abort tests 
these will be conducted using the orion abort test booster atb similar to the little joe ii used for apollo testing a boilerplate orion capsule and the escape tower will be tested on these missions it is scheduled for april 2019 at the earliest


 pad abort tests 
these were planned to test the launch escape system of the orion spacecraft on the launchpad
