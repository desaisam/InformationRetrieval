the scattered disc or scattered disk is a distant circumstellar disc in the solar system that is sparsely populated by icy small solar system bodies which are a subset of the broader family of trans-neptunian objects the scattered-disc objects sdos have orbital eccentricities ranging as high as 0.8 inclinations as high as 40° and perihelia greater than 30 astronomical units 4.5×109 km 2.8×109 mi these extreme orbits are thought to be the result of gravitational scattering by the gas giants and the objects continue to be subject to perturbation by the planet neptune
although the closest scattered-disc objects approach the sun at about 30–35 au their orbits can extend well beyond 100 au this makes scattered objects among the coldest and most distant objects in the solar system the innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the kuiper belt but its outer limits reach much farther away from the sun and farther above and below the ecliptic than the kuiper belt properbecause of its unstable nature astronomers now consider the scattered disc to be the place of origin for most periodic comets in the solar system with the centaurs a population of icy bodies between jupiter and neptune being the intermediate stage in an objects migration from the disc to the inner solar system eventually perturbations from the giant planets send such objects towards the sun transforming them into periodic comets many objects of the proposed oort cloud are also thought to have originated in the scattered disc detached objects are not sharply distinct from scattered disc objects and some such as sedna have sometimes been considered to be included in this group


 discovery 

traditionally devices like a blink comparator were used in astronomy to detect objects in the solar system because these objects would move between two exposures—this involved time-consuming steps like exposing and developing photographic plates or films and people then using a blink comparator to manually detect prospective objects during the 1980s the use of ccd-based cameras in telescopes made it possible to directly produce electronic images that could then be readily digitized and transferred to digital images because the ccd captured more light than film about 90% versus 10% of incoming light and the blinking could now be done at an adjustable computer screen the surveys allowed for higher throughput a flood of new discoveries was the result over a thousand trans-neptunian objects were detected between 1992 and 2006the first scattered-disc object sdo to be recognised as such was 1996 tl66 originally identified in 1996 by astronomers based at mauna kea in hawaii three more were identified by the same survey in 1999 1999 cv118 1999 cy118 and 1999 cf119 the first object presently classified as an sdo to be discovered was 1995 tl8 found in 1995 by spacewatchas of 2011 over 200 sdos have been identified including gǃkúnǁ’hòmdímà discovered by schwamb brown and rabinowitz 2002 tc302 neat eris brown trujillo and rabinowitz sedna brown trujillo and rabinowitz and 2004 vn112 deep ecliptic survey although the numbers of objects in the kuiper belt and the scattered disc are hypothesized to be roughly equal observational bias due to their greater distance means that far fewer sdos have been observed to date


 subdivisions of trans-neptunian space 

known trans-neptunian objects are often divided into two subpopulations the kuiper belt and the scattered disc a third reservoir of trans-neptunian objects the oort cloud has been hypothesized although no confirmed direct observations of the oort cloud have been made some researchers further suggest a transitional space between the scattered disc and the inner oort cloud populated with detached objects


 scattered disc versus kuiper belt 

the kuiper belt is a relatively thick torus or doughnut of space extending from about 30 to 50 au comprising two main populations of kuiper belt objects kbos the classical kuiper-belt objects or cubewanos which lie in orbits untouched by neptune and the resonant kuiper-belt objects those which neptune has locked into a precise orbital ratio such as 23 the object goes around twice for every three neptune orbits and 12 the object goes around once for every two neptune orbits these ratios called orbital resonances allow kbos to persist in regions which neptunes gravitational influence would otherwise have cleared out over the age of the solar system since the objects are never close enough to neptune to be scattered by its gravity those in 23 resonances are known as plutinos because pluto is the largest member of their group whereas those in 12 resonances are known as twotinos
in contrast to the kuiper belt the scattered-disc population can be disturbed by neptune scattered-disc objects come within gravitational range of neptune at their closest approaches 30 au but their farthest distances reach many times that ongoing research suggests that the centaurs a class of icy planetoids that orbit between jupiter and neptune may simply be sdos thrown into the inner reaches of the solar system by neptune making them cis-neptunian rather than trans-neptunian scattered objects some objects like 29981 1999 td10 blur the distinction and the minor planet center mpc which officially catalogues all trans-neptunian objects now lists centaurs and sdos togetherthe mpc however makes a clear distinction between the kuiper belt and the scattered disc separating those objects in stable orbits the kuiper belt from those in scattered orbits the scattered disc and the centaurs however the difference between the kuiper belt and the scattered disc is not clear-cut and many astronomers see the scattered disc not as a separate population but as an outward region of the kuiper belt another term used is scattered kuiper-belt object or skbo for bodies of the scattered discmorbidelli and brown propose that the difference between objects in the kuiper belt and scattered-disc objects is that the latter bodies are transported in semi-major axis by close and distant encounters with neptune but the former experienced no such close encounters this delineation is inadequate as they note over the age of the solar system since bodies trapped in resonances could pass from a scattering phase to a non-scattering phase and vice versa numerous times that is trans-neptunian objects could travel back and forth between the kuiper belt and the scattered disc over time therefore they chose instead to define the regions rather than the objects defining the scattered disc as the region of orbital space that can be visited by bodies that have encountered neptune within the radius of a hill sphere and the kuiper belt as its complement  in the a  30 au region the region of the solar system populated by objects with semi-major axes greater than 30 au


 detached objects 

the minor planet center classifies the trans-neptunian object 90377 sedna as a scattered-disc object its discoverer michael e brown has suggested instead that it should be considered an inner oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc because with a perihelion distance of 76 au it is too remote to be affected by the gravitational attraction of the outer planets
 under this definition an object with a perihelion greater than 40 au could be classified as outside the scattered disc
sedna is not the only such object 148209 2000 cr105 discovered before sedna and 2004 vn112 have a perihelion too far away from neptune to be influenced by it this led to a discussion among astronomers about a new minor planet set called the extended scattered disc e-sdo
 2000 cr105 may also be an inner oort-cloud object or more likely a transitional object between the scattered disc and the inner oort cloud more recently these objects have been referred to as detached or distant detached objects ddothere are no clear boundaries between the scattered and detached regions gomes et al define sdos as having highly eccentric orbits perihelia beyond neptune and semi-major axes beyond the 12 resonance by this definition all distant detached objects are sdos since detached objects orbits cannot be produced by neptune scattering alternative scattering mechanisms have been put forward including a passing star or a distant planet-sized objecta scheme introduced by a 2005 report from the deep ecliptic survey by j l elliott et al distinguishes between two categories scattered-near ie typical sdos and scattered-extended ie detached objects scattered-near objects are those whose orbits are non-resonant non-planetary-orbit-crossing and have a tisserand parameter relative to neptune less than 3 scattered-extended objects have a tisserand parameter relative to neptune greater than 3 and have a time-averaged eccentricity greater than 0.2an alternative classification introduced by b j gladman b g marsden and c van laerhoven in 2007 uses 10-million-year orbit integration instead of the tisserand parameter an object qualifies as an sdo if its orbit is not resonant has a semi-major axis no greater than 2000 au and during the integration its semi-major axis shows an excursion of 1.5 au or more gladman et al suggest the term scattering disk object to emphasize this present mobility if the object is not an sdo as per the above definition but the eccentricity of its orbit is greater than 0.240 it is classified as a detached tno objects with smaller eccentricity are considered classical in this scheme the disc extends from the orbit of neptune to 2000 au the region referred to as the inner oort cloud


 orbits 

the scattered disc is a very dynamic environment because they are still capable of being perturbed by neptune sdos orbits are always in danger of disruption either of being sent outward to the oort cloud or inward into the centaur population and ultimately the jupiter family of comets for this reason gladman et al prefer to refer to the region as the scattering disc rather than scattered unlike kuiper-belt objects kbos the orbits of scattered-disc objects can be inclined as much as 40° from the eclipticsdos are typically characterized by orbits with medium and high eccentricities with a semi-major axis greater than 50 au but their perihelia bring them within influence of neptune having a perihelion of roughly 30 au is one of the defining characteristics of scattered objects as it allows neptune to exert its gravitational influencethe classical objects cubewanos are very different from the scattered objects more than 30% of all cubewanos are on low-inclination near-circular orbits whose eccentricities peak at 0.25 classical objects possess eccentricities ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 though the inclinations of scattered objects are similar to the more extreme kbos very few scattered objects have orbits as close to the ecliptic as much of the kbo populationalthough motions in the scattered disc are random they do tend to follow similar directions which means that sdos can become trapped in temporary resonances with neptune examples of possible resonant orbits within the scattered disc include 13 27 311 522 and 479


 formation 

the scattered disc is still poorly understood no model of the formation of the kuiper belt and the scattered disc has yet been proposed that explains all their observed propertiesaccording to contemporary models the scattered disc formed when kuiper belt objects kbos were scattered into eccentric and inclined orbits by gravitational interaction with neptune and the other outer planets the amount of time for this process to occur remains uncertain one hypothesis estimates a period equal to the entire age of the solar system a second posits that the scattering took place relatively quickly during neptunes early migration epochmodels for a continuous formation throughout the age of the solar system illustrate that at weak resonances within the kuiper belt such as 57 or 81 or at the boundaries of stronger resonances objects can develop weak orbital instabilities over millions of years the 47 resonance in particular has large instability kbos can also be shifted into unstable orbits by close passage of massive objects or through collisions over time the scattered disc would gradually form from these isolated eventscomputer simulations  have also suggested a more rapid and earlier formation for the scattered disc modern theories indicate that neither uranus nor neptune could have formed in situ beyond saturn as too little primordial matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass instead these planets and saturn may have formed closer to jupiter but were flung outwards during the early evolution of the solar system perhaps through exchanges of angular momentum with scattered objects once the orbits of jupiter and saturn shifted to a 21 resonance two jupiter orbits for each orbit of saturn their combined gravitational pull disrupted the orbits of uranus and neptune sending neptune into the temporary chaos of the proto-kuiper belt as neptune traveled outward it scattered many trans-neptunian objects into higher and more eccentric orbits this model states that 90% or more of the objects in the scattered disc may have been promoted into these eccentric orbits by neptunes resonances during the migration epochtherefore the scattered disc might not be so scattered


 composition 

scattered objects like other trans-neptunian objects have low densities and are composed largely of frozen volatiles such as water and methane spectral analysis of selected kuiper belt and scattered objects has revealed signatures of similar compounds both pluto and eris for instance show signatures for methaneastronomers originally supposed that the entire trans-neptunian population would show a similar red surface colour as they were thought to have originated in the same region and subjected to the same physical processes specifically sdos were expected to have large amounts of surface methane chemically altered into complex organic molecules by energy from the sun this would absorb blue light creating a reddish hue most classical objects display this colour but scattered objects do not instead they present a white or greyish appearanceone explanation is the exposure of whiter subsurface layers by impacts another is that the scattered objects greater distance from the sun creates a composition gradient analogous to the composition gradient of the terrestrial and gas giant planets michael e brown discoverer of the scattered object eris suggests that its paler colour could be because at its current distance from the sun its atmosphere of methane is frozen over its entire surface creating an inches-thick layer of bright white ice pluto conversely being closer to the sun would be warm enough that methane would freeze only onto cooler high-albedo regions leaving low-albedo tholin-covered regions bare of ice


 comets 

the kuiper belt was initially thought to be the source of the solar systems ecliptic comets however studies of the region since 1992 have shown that the orbits within the kuiper belt are relatively stable and that ecliptic comets originate from the scattered disc where orbits are generally less stablecomets can loosely be divided into two categories short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to originate in the oort cloud the two major categories of short-period comets are jupiter-family comets jfcs and halley-type comets halley-type comets which are named after their prototype halleys comet are thought to have originated in the oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner solar system by the gravity of the giant planets whereas the jfcs are thought to have originated in the scattered disc the centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the jupiter familythere are many differences between sdos and jfcs even though many of the jupiter-family comets may have originated in the scattered disc although the centaurs share a reddish or neutral coloration with many sdos their nuclei are bluer indicating a fundamental chemical or physical difference one hypothesis is that comet nuclei are resurfaced as they approach the sun by subsurface materials which subsequently bury the older material
