colonies in antiquity were city-states founded from a mother-city its metropolis not from a territory-at-large bonds between a colony and its metropolis remained often close and took specific forms  generally colonies founded by carthage rome alexander the great and his successors remained tied to their metropolis but greek colonies of the archaic and classical eras were sovereign and self-governing from their inception while greek colonies were often founded to solve social unrest in the mother-city by expelling a part of the population hellenistic carthaginian and roman colonies were used for empire-building


 egyptian colony 
an egyptian colony that was stationed in southern canaan dates to slightly before the first dynasty narmer had egyptian pottery produced in canaan and exported back to egypt from regions such as arad en besor rafiah and tel ʿerani shipbuilding was known to the ancient egyptians as early as 3000 bc and perhaps earlier the archaeological institute of america reports that the earliest dated ship — dating to 3000 bc – may have possibly belonged to pharaoh aha


 phoenician colonies 

the phoenicians were the major trading power in the mediterranean in the early part of the first millennium bc they had trading contacts in egypt and greece and established colonies as far west as modern spain at gadir modern cádiz
from gadir the phoenicians controlled access to the atlantic ocean and the trade routes to britain the most famous and successful of phoenician colonies was found by settlers from tyre in 814–813 bc and called kart-hadasht qart-ḥadašt literally new town known to history as carthage the carthaginians later founded their own colony in the southeast of spain carthago nova which was eventually conquered by their enemy rome
according to maría eugenia aubet professor of archaeology at the pompeu fabra university barcelona the earliest presence of phoenician material in the west is documented within the precinct of the ancient city of huelva spain the high proportion of phoenician pottery among the new material drinking was founded in 1997 in the plaza de las monjas in huelva argues in favor of a regular presence of phoenician people from the start of the 9th century bc the recent radiocarbon dates from the earliest levels in carthage situate the founding of this tyrian colony in the years 835–800 cal bc which coincides with the dates handed down by flavius josephus and timeus for the founding of the city


 ancient greek colonies 

in ancient greece a vanquished people would sometimes found a colony leaving their homes to escape subjection at the hand of a foreign enemy sometimes colonies formed as a sequel to civil disorders when the losers in internecine battles left to form a new city elsewhere sometimes to get rid of surplus population and thereby to avoid internal convulsions and also as a result of ostracism but in most cases colony-founders aimed to establish and facilitate relations of trade with foreign countries and to further the wealth of the mother-city in greek μητρόπολισ mētropolis colonies were established in ionia and thrace as early as the 8th century bcmore than thirty greek city-states had multiple colonies they became dotted across the mediterranean world with the most active colony-founding city miletus of the ionian league spawning ninety colonies stretching throughout the mediterranean sea from the shores of the black sea and anatolia modern turkey in the east to the southern coast of the iberian peninsula in the west as well as several colonies on the libyan coast of northern africa from the late 9th to the 5th centuries bc
greeks founded two similar types of colony one known as an ἀποικία apoikía – a designation reflecting the  greek roots ἀπό apó “away from”  οἶκοσ oîkos “home” pl ἀποικίαι apoikiai – and the other as an ἐμπόριov – emporion pl ἐμπόρια emporia the first type of colony was a city-state on its own the second was a greek trading-colony
the greek city-states began establishing colonies around 900 – 800 bc at first at al mina on the coast of syria and the greek emporium pithekoussai at ischia in the bay of naples both established about 800 bc by euboeans

two waves of new colonists set out from greece at the transition between the dark ages and the start of the archaic period – the first in the early 8th century bc and a second burst of the colonizing spirit in the 6th century population growth and cramped spaces at home seem an insufficient explanation while the economical and political dynamics produced by the competitive spirit between the frequently kingless greek city-states – newly introduced as a concept and striving to expand their spheres of economical influence – better fits as their true incentive through this greek expansion the use of coins flourished throughout the mediterranean basin
influential greek colonies in the western mediterranean – many of them in todays italy — included cyme rhegium rhegion by chalcis and zankle c 8th century syracuse by corinthtenea c 734 bc naxos by chalcis c 734 bc massalia the later marseille france c 598 bc and agathe shortly after massalia by phokaia elea italy and  emporion present-day spain by phokaiamassalia c 540 bc and early 6th century antipolis nowadays france by achaea alalia corsica by phokaiamassalia c 545 bc and cyrene cyrenaica present-day libya by thera 762/61 and 632/31 bcthe greeks also colonised modern-day crimea in the black sea the settlements they established there included the city of  chersonesos at the site of modern-day sevastopol another area with significant greek colonies was the coast of ancient illyria on the adriatic sea eg the ancient aspalathos modern-day split croatia

cicero remarks on the extensive greek colonization noting that it were as though a greek fringe has been woven about the shores of the barbarians several formulae generally shaped the solemn and sacred occasions when a new colony set forth if a greek city decided to send out a colony the citizenry almost invariably consulted an oracle especially one such as the oracle of delphi beforehand sometimes certain classes of citizens were called upon to take part in the enterprises sometimes one son was chosen by lot from every house where there were several sons and strangers expressing a desire to join were admitted a person of distinction was selected to guide the emigrants and to make the necessary arrangements it was usual to honor these founders of colonies after their death as heroes some of the sacred fire was taken from the public hearth in the prytaneum from which the fire on the public hearth of the new city was kindled just as each individual had his private shrines so the new community maintained the worship of its chief domestic deities the colony sending embassies and votive gifts to the mother-citys principal festivals for centuries afterwards
after the conquests of the macedonian kingdom and alexander the great a further number of  hellenistic colonies were founded also in asia as far away as india europe and africa


 greek colonies in anatolia 
the mycenaeans greeks by the 15th century bc had reached rhodes crete cyprus where teucer is said to have founded the first colony and the shores of asia minor moreover greeks were settled in ionia and pontus miletus in ionia was an ancient greek city on the western coast of anatolia near the mouth of the maeander river the late bronze age 13th century bc milesian saw the arrival in the area of luwian language speakers from south central anatolia calling themselves the carians later in that century other greeks arrived the city at that time rebelled against the hittites empire after the fall of that empire the city was destroyed in the 12th century bc and starting about 1000 bc was resettled extensively by the ionian greeks before the invasion from persia in the middle of the 6th century bc miletus was considered the greatest and wealthiest of greek polis over several centuries numerous ancient greek city-states were established on the coasts of anatolia greeks started western philosophy on the western coast of anatolia pre-socratic philosophy thales anaximander anaximenes diogenes of apollonia were among of the renowned milesian school philosophers heraclitus lived in ephesus ˈɛfəsəs1 greek ἔφεσοσ ephesos turkish efes another ancient greek city and anaxagoras was from clazomenae a city on the coast of ionia and a member of the ionian league  all ancient greek dialects were spoken in anatolia depending on the origin of the city states and the list of ancient greek theatres in anatolia is one of the longest among all places greeks had settled  in pontus greeks traditionally lived in the region of pontus on the shores of todays turkeys black sea and in the pontic alps in northeastern anatolia and the former armenian province of kars in caucasus and also in georgia those from southern russia the ukraine and crimea are often referred to as northern pontic greeks in contrast to those from south pontus which strictly speaking is pontus proper those from georgia northeastern anatolia and the ones who lived in present-day armenia are often referred to as eastern pontic greeks or caucasus greeks the greeks have founded well known cities to this day  the cities of sinope greek σινώπη sinōpē and trabzon greek τραπεζοῦσ trapezous were founded by milesian traders 756 bc as well as samsun rize and amasya  greek was the lingua franca of anatolia from the conquests of alexander the great up to the invasion of the seljuk turks in the eleventh century ad


 relations of colony and metropolis 
the relation between colony and mother-city known literally as the metropolis was viewed as one of mutual affection any differences that arose were resolved by peaceful means whenever possible war being deemed excusable only in cases of extreme necessity note though that the peloponnesian war of 431 -404 bc broke out in part as a result of a dispute between corinth and her colony of corcyra the charter of foundation contained general provisions for the arrangement of the affairs of the colony and also some special enactments a colony would usually adopt the constitution of the mother-city but the new city remained politically independent the holy fire of the metropolis was preserved in a special place to remind people of the common ties if the colony sent out a fresh colony on its own account the mother-city was generally consulted or was at least requested to furnish a leader frequently the colonies declaring their commitment to the various metropolitic alliances formed in the greek mainland and for religious reasons would pay tribute in religious centres like delphi olympia or delosthe cleruchs κληροῦχοι klêrouchoi formed a special class of greek colonists each being assigned an individual plot of land κλῆροσ klêros in the place to which they had been assigned the trade factories set up in foreign countries such as egypt were somewhat different from the ordinary colonies the members retaining the right of domicile in their own homeland and confining themselves to their own quarter in the foreign city


 roman colonies 

it was an old custom in ancient italy to send out colonies for the purpose of securing new conquests the romans having no standing army used to plant bodies of their own citizens in conquered towns as a kind of garrison these bodies would consist partly of roman citizens usually to the number of three hundred partly of members of the latin league in larger numbers the third part of the conquered territory was handed over to the settlers the coloniae civium romanorum colonies of roman citizens were specially intended to secure the two seacoasts of italy and were hence called coloniae maritimae the coloniae latinae of which there was a far greater number served the same purpose for the mainland
the duty of leading the colonists and founding the settlement was entrusted to a commission usually consisting of three members these men continued to stand in the relation of patrons patroni to the colony after its foundation the colonists entered the conquered city in military array preceded by banners and the foundation was celebrated with special solemnities the coloniae were free from taxes and had their own constitution a copy of the roman electing from their own body their senate and other officers of state to this constitution the original inhabitants had to submit the coloniae civium romanorum retained roman citizenship and were free from military service their position as outposts being regarded as an equivalent the members of the coloniae latinae served among the socii the allies and possessed the so-called ius latinum or latinitas this secured to them the right of acquiring property the concept of commercium and the right of settlement in rome and under certain conditions the power of becoming roman citizens though in course of time these rights underwent many limitations
from the time of the gracchi the colonies lost their military character colonization came to be regarded as a means of providing for the poorest class of the roman plebs after the time of sulla it was adopted as a way of granting land to veteran soldiers the right of founding colonies was taken away from the people by julius caesar and passed into the hands of the roman emperors who used it mainly in the provinces for the exclusive purpose of establishing military settlements partly with the old idea of securing conquered territory it was only in exceptional cases that the provincial colonies enjoyed the immunity from taxation which was granted to those in italy
