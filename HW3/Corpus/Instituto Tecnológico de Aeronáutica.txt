the instituto tecnológico de aeronáutica ita english aeronautics institute of technology is an institution of higher education and advanced research with emphasis in aerospace science and technology maintained by the brazilian federal government with the support of the brazilian air force it is located in são josé dos campos brazil  ita is rated as one of the top and most prestigious engineering schools in brazil
the schools admission exams for its undergraduate courses called vestibular in brazil are considered to be the most competitive in the country and take place annually in over 25 cities throughout brazil its undergrad program acceptance rate in 2016 was only 1.12% 140 accepted students out of 12493 nationwide applicants
it is one of four institutes that encompass the brazilian general command for aerospace technology cta having its facilities along with its laboratories and rd centers inside the campus of cta ita is often mistakenly considered to be a military institution because of its location but it is 100% civilian in nature with a vast majority of civilian teachers directors and students the air force does help maintain the institution though and in exchange uses it for the training of its engineers
the institution was created in 1950 being responsible and contributing in a great extent for the research and development of the aerospace and defense sectors in brazil including the brazilian national institute for space research - inpe embraer and avibrás
ita offers regular 5-year engineering undergraduate courses bachelor of engineering and graduate programs including masters and doctoral degrees all undergraduate students are granted full scholarships and board during entire five-year period complete residential facilities are offered to the students inside the campus at a minimal cost the college is known for being rigorous demanding focus and a great effort from the students


 history 
ita was idealized and initially run by the marshal casimiro montenegro filho who was then a coronel montenegro was an air force pilot and pioneer who had  also received a degree in engineering the idea of building a school of excellence in aeronautics engineering and related fields came as the first step towards building a strong aeronautics industry in brazil
a commission was created in 1946 in order to organize the technical center of aeronautics in portuguese centro técnico de aeronáutica or cta a sprawling facility that was later renamed but kept the same acronym ita was to be the first institution in cta which would later harbor other aerospace related institutes
marshal casimiro montenegro was very passionate and idealist and was committed to creating the best school that could possibly be created he visited the most renowned aeronautics engineering schools in the us at the time the massachusetts institute of technology and the wright field home of the air force institute of technology there he hired mits professor richard harbert smith to help develop a plan for such a school which was dubbed the smith plan prof smith would later become itas first rector
montenegro hired renowned foreign professors and experts from various parts of the world to teach at ita the majority of them from mit influenced by prof smith at a given time of its history ita had teachers from more than 20 different nationalities in its faculty an impressive number considering it had and still has a faculty of little more than 100 teachers nowadays the overwhelming majority of the teachers are brazilians many of whom have graduated from ita themselvesa book by tércio pacitti a former ita rector mentions that montenegro went to great lengths in order to be able to hire and maintain a super-star faculty their pay was considerably high a requirement to convince them to move to an unknown and poor country as was brazil in the 50s he had many times to conceal their actual pay from his superiors in the air force disguising it as other forms of expenditures
at the same time the team of professors brought to brazil by montenegro started to lecture in the army technical school este nowadays ime instituto militar de engenharia in rio de janeiro ctas and itas facilities began to be built in the city of são josé dos campos this city was small and its economy was mainly rural but casimiro and his fellows predicted that due to its location between brazils biggest cities rio de janeiro and são paulo and geography it was a good place to be the birth of the aeronautics industry in brazil they turned out to be right since about only 20 years later a company called embraer nowadays the third largest commercial jet manufacturer in the world was started there created and run by itas alumni
in 1950 itas basic facilities were finished and its first students moved there from rio to finish the courses they had started in the armys facilities despite the fact ita was run and maintained mostly by the air force most of its students were civilians that was a key point in the smith plan that ita should form civilian engineers to aid in the development of the brazilian industry specially the aeronautical one over the years a larger percentage of itas revenues began to come directly from the government nowadays the air force contributes with an amount that is somewhat proportional to the number of military students at ita

 military career 
due to itas strong connection with the air force the undergraduate students have the choice to become part of the military as engineering officers or keep their status as civilians as members of the reserve when they apply about 20% of the students admitted in the institute follow the military career  starting to receive paychecks and wearing uniforms at the beginning of their 3rd year of school most of the students follow a civilian career pursuing jobs in the market in brazil or abroad as they graduate
during their first year at ita the undergraduate students are required to attend a military preparation course once a week and receive monthly cost-of-living allowances for it during this period  for the male students it also fulfills their obligatory military service which all male citizens in brazil are required to attend although the majority of them are dismissed at presentation


 numbers undergraduate courses only 

ita is currently accepting between 120 and 130 undergraduate students per year
9,080 students took itas admission exam in the year of 2003 and about 8,000 in 2004 that means there were about 70 applicants per vacancy or that only about 1.5% of the applicants were accepted
about 4,600 engineers graduated from ita since its foundation
embraer alone which was created by itas undergraduate alumni and currently employs hundreds of engineers from ita generated a positive net export balance of 1.529 billion in 2005 over 150 times the yearly investment made in ita by the brazilian government
by the time ita was created its home town são josé dos campos had about 44,000 inhabitants and its economy was mainly rural nowadays the city has about 630,000 inhabitants or close to 1,000,000 when the population of adjacent cities is included and it has become one of the most important industrial and research hubs in the country


 admissions undergraduate courses only 
as in most of brazilian universities and colleges admissions at ita are made by means of a series of written exams applied annually called vestibular itas vestibular is composed of 5 exams each on one of the following subjects mathematics physics chemistry portuguese and english the english exam is only eliminatory meaning the candidates are only required to achieve a minimum result in order to be qualified the other four exams are eliminatory and competitive meaning the applicants with the higher average grade the four tests have equal weights will be selected
students are selected based exclusively on their grades in the exam and will be distributed in the 5 available engineering courses according to number of seats available for each course and the list of course preferences the student fills at the time of his application
the subjects of the exams are covered in much greater depth and difficulty than the exams from other colleges and universities in brazil  including all the top universities such as unesp unicamp ufmg usp ufrj ufrgs what makes it a necessity for the student to be prepared specifically for itas entrance exam that usually demands an extra year of study or more students often take the test 3 or 4 years before being selected another engineering college maintained by the army instituto militar de engenharia military institute of engineering - ime have exams of similar difficulty but with a smaller number of candidates candidates usually prepare for both exams from ita and ime in a way that the majority of the candidates selected by ita ends up being selected by ime as well the vast majority of the candidates nowadays chooses to study at ita when approved in both schools due to the civilian nature of ita and its better renown in the market


 course evaluation results 
from the 1996 to 2003 the brazilian government conducted yearly evaluation exams for every undergraduate course in brazil written exams specific to every different type of college course were given to every student at the time of their graduation and the results were used to evaluate the quality of the college courses and schools in brazil these exams were called provão big test in english

based on the average grade obtained by the students course every school was given a grade from a to e for each of its courses with a being the best ita was the only institution in brazil to have obtained only as in all the years of provão for all of its courses the provão results are somewhat misleading though as the grades are given by ordering the average grades of the schools in a list and giving the label a to a certain predefined number of schools and so on therefore two schools that were given the grade a can have substantially different scores and that is usually the case the actual grades for each school were not announced by the government but a list with the highest average grades in 2003 leaked and was published by the national magazine vejathe published list showed that the courses of electronic and computer engineering at ita which both took the exam of electrical engineering attained the highest average grade of the whole provão in 2003 its students had an average grade of 79.6 of a total of 100 this average was about 5 point higher than imes the 2nd position for electrical engineering with 75.2 about 14 points higher than the 3rd position ufrgs with 66.3 and about 17 point higher than renowned usp and unicamp with  62.7 and 62.2 respectively it was about 24 points higher than the 10th position for this course that is a relative difference of more than 40 all ten schools published in the list attained an a grade at provão
it is now known that in almost every year of provão up to 2003 itas courses figured in either first or second place in its categories usually competing with ime both within considerable distance from the remaining schools it is hard though to  point references for such information as it usually comes from unofficial sources or scattered news from journalists that had access to leaked information inep the government institute which conducts these evaluations publishes the results of all provões at its website but only shows the alphabetic grade and percentiles in which the students from the institution are usually more than 90% of itas students figure between the top 25% grades in provão in 2003 94,3% of itas electronic and computer engineering students were between the 25% top grades of the exam
in the first edition of enade for engineering in 2005 successor of provão which is only held about every 3 years itas computer engineering course once again achieved the highest grade of its category for the enade the government is publishing the actual average grade of each school at ineps website in 2008 itas electronics engineering courses scored the highest evaluation grade among all university courses from the areas evaluated in 2008 which included all engineering areas computer science math architecture among others the course evaluation grade of itas electronics engineering was 485 out of a maximum of 500 based on the test results of the students graduated in 2008
