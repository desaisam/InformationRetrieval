alpha centauri latinized from α centauri abbreviated alpha cen or α cen is the closest star system and closest planetary system to the solar system at 4.37 light-years 1.34 pc from the sun it is a triple star system consisting of three stars α centauri a officially rigil kentaurus α centauri b officially toliman and α centauri c officially proxima centaurialpha centauri a and b are sun-like stars class g and k and together they form the binary star alpha centauri ab to the naked eye the two main components appear to be a single star with an apparent magnitude of −0.27 forming the brightest star in the southern constellation of centaurus and the third-brightest in the night sky outshone only by sirius and canopus
alpha centauri a has 1.1 times the mass and 1.519 times the luminosity of the sun while alpha centauri b is smaller and cooler at 0.907 times the suns mass and 0.445 times its luminosity the pair orbit about a common centre with an orbital period of 79.91 years their elliptical orbit is eccentric so that the distance between a and b varies from 35.6 astronomical units au or about the distance between pluto and the sun to that between saturn and the sun 11.2 au
alpha centauri c or proxima centauri is a small and faint red dwarf class m though not visible to the naked eye proxima centauri is the closest star to the sun at a distance of 4.24 light-years 1.30 pc slightly closer than alpha centauri ab currently the distance between proxima centauri and alpha centauri ab is about 13,000 astronomical units 0.21 ly equivalent to about 430 times the radius of neptunes orbit proxima centauri b is an earth-sized exoplanet in the habitable zone of proxima centauri it was discovered in 2016


 nomenclature 
α centauri latinized to alpha centauri is the systems bayer designation it once bore the name rigil kentaurus which is a latinisation of the arabic name رجل القنطورس‎ rijl al-qanṭūris meaning foot of the centauralpha centauri c was discovered in 1915 by robert t a innes who suggested that it be named proxima centaurus later amended to proxima centauri the name is from latin meaning nearest star of centaurusin 2016 the working group on star names of the international astronomical union having decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems approved the names rigil kentaurus for alpha centauri a and proxima centauri for alpha centauri c in 10 august 2018 iau approved the name toliman for alpha centauri b


 stellar system 
alpha centauri is a triple star system with its two main stars alpha centauri a and alpha centauri b being a binary component the ab designation or older a×b denotes the mass centre of a main binary system relative to companion stars in a multiple star system ab-c refers to the component of proxima centauri in relation to the central binary being the distance between the centre of mass and the outlying companion because the distance between proxima c and either of alpha centauri a or b is similar the ab binary system is sometimes treated as a single gravitational object


 orbital properties 

the a and b components of alpha centauri have an orbital period of 79.91 years their orbit is moderately eccentric e  0.5179 their closest approach is 11.2 au 1.68 billion km or about the distance between the sun and saturn and their furthest separation is 35.6 au 5.33 billion km about the distance between the sun and plutoviewed from earth the apparent orbit of a and b means that their separation and position angle pa are in continuous change throughout their projected orbit observed stellar positions in 2019 are separated by 4.92 arcsec through the pa of 337.1° increasing to 5.49 arcsec through 345.3° in 2020 the closest recent approach was in february 2016 at 4.0 arcsec through the pa of 300° the observed maximum separation of these stars is about 22 arcsec while the minimum distance is 1.7 arcsec the widest separation occurred during february 1976 and the next will be in january 2056the most recent true orbit closest approach or periastron was in august 1955 and the next will be in may 2035 the furthest orbital separation or apastron last occurred in may 1995 and the next will be in 2075 the apparent distance between alpha centauri a and b is rapidly decreasing at least until 2019alpha centauri c is about 13,000 astronomical units au away from alpha centauri ab this is equivalent to 0.21 ly or 1.9 trillion km—about 5% the distance between alpha centauri ab and the sun for a long time estimates of proximas small orbital speed around ab were insufficiently accurate to determine whether proxima centauri is bound to the alpha centauri system or an unrelated star that happens to be passing by at a low speed
radial velocity measurements made in 2017 were precise enough to show that proxima centauri and alpha centauri ab are gravitationally bound the orbital period of proxima centauri is approximately 5470006600−4000 years with an eccentricity of 0.50 ± 0.08 more eccentric than mercurys proxima centauri comes within 43001100−900 au of ab at periastron and the apastron occurs at 13000300−100 au


 physical properties 

asteroseismic studies chromospheric activity and stellar rotation gyrochronology are all consistent with the alpha centauri system being similar in age to or slightly older than the sun asteroseismic analyses that incorporate tight observational constraints on the stellar parameters for the alpha centauri stars have yielded age estimates of 4.85±0.5 gyr 5.0±0.5 gyr 5.2 ± 1.9 gyr 6.4 gyr and 6.52±0.3 gyr age estimates for the stars based on chromospheric activity calcium h  k emission yield 4.4 ± 2.1 gyr whereas gyrochronology yields 5.0±0.3 gyr stellar evolution theory implies both stars are slightly older than the sun at 5 to 6 billion years as derived by their mass and spectral characteristicsfrom the orbital elements the total mass of alpha centauri ab is about 2.0 m☉—or twice that of the sun the average individual stellar masses are 1.09 m☉ and 0.90 m☉ respectively though slightly higher masses have been quoted in recent years such as 1.14 m☉ and 0.92 m☉ or totalling 2.06 m☉ alpha centauri a and b have absolute magnitudes of 4.38 and 5.71 respectively


 alpha centauri a 
alpha centauri a also known as rigil kentaurus is the principal member or primary of the binary system it is a solar-like main-sequence star with a similar yellowish colour whose stellar classification is spectral type g2 v it is slightly larger and more luminous than the sun alpha centauri a is about 10 percent more massive than the sun with a radius about 22 percent larger when considered among the individual brightest stars in the sky excluding the sun it is the fourth brightest at an apparent magnitude of −0.01 being slightly fainter than arcturus at an apparent magnitude of −0.04
the type of magnetic activity on alpha centauri a is comparable to that of the sun showing coronal variability due to star spots as modulated by the rotation of the star however since 2005 the activity level has fallen into a deep minimum that might be similar to the suns historical maunder minimum alternatively it may have a very long stellar activity cycle and is slowly recovering from a minimum phase


 alpha centauri b 
alpha centauri b also known as toliman is the secondary star of the binary system it is a main-sequence star of spectral type k1 v making it more an orange colour than alpha centauri a it has around 90 percent the mass of the sun and a 14 percent smaller diameter although it has a lower luminosity than a alpha centauri b emits more energy in the x-ray band its light curve varies on a short time scale and there has been at least one observed flare it is more magnetically active than alpha centauri a showing a cycle of 8.2±0.2 yr compared to 11 years for the sun and about half the minimum-to-peak variation in coronal luminosity of the sun alpha centauri b has an apparent magnitude of 1.35 slightly dimmer than beta crucis


 alpha centauri c 

alpha centauri c better known as proxima centauri is a small main-sequence red dwarf of spectral class m6 ve it has an absolute magnitude of 15.60 over 20,000 times fainter than the sun its mass is calculated to be 0.1221 m☉


 observation 

to the naked eye alpha centauri ab appears to be a single star the brightest in the southern constellation of centaurus their apparent angular separation varies over about 80 years between 2 and 22 arcsec the naked eye has a resolution of 60 arcsec but through much of the orbit both are easily resolved in binoculars or small telescopes at −0.27 apparent magnitude combined for a and b magnitudes alpha centauri is fainter only than sirius and canopus it forms the outer star of the pointers or the southern pointers so called because the line through beta centauri hadaragena
some 4.5° west points to the constellation crux—the southern cross the pointers easily distinguish the true southern cross from the fainter asterism known as the false cross

south of about 29° s latitude alpha centauri is circumpolar and never sets below the horizon north of about 29° n latitude alpha centauri never rises alpha centauri lies close to the southern horizon when viewed from the 29° n latitude to the equator close to hermosillo chihuahua city in mexico galveston texas ocala florida and lanzarote the canary islands of spain but only for a short time around its culmination the star culminates each year at local midnight on 24 april and at local 9 pm on 8 juneas seen from earth proxima centauri is 2.2° southwest from alpha centauri ab about four times the angular diameter of the moon  proxima centauri appears as a deep-red star of a typical apparent magnitude of 11.1 in a sparsely populated star field requiring moderately sized telescopes to be seen listed as v645 cen in the general catalogue of variable stars version 4.2 this uv ceti-type flare star can unexpectedly brighten rapidly by as much as 0.6 magnitudes at visual wavelengths then fade after only a few minutes some amateur and professional astronomers regularly monitor for outbursts using either optical or radio telescopes in august 2015 the largest recorded flares of the star occurred with the star becoming 8.3 times brighter than normal on 13 august in the b band blue light region


 observational history 

alpha centauri is listed in the 2nd-century star catalog of ptolemy he gave its ecliptic coordinates but texts differ as to whether the ecliptic latitude reads 44° 10′ south or 41° 10′ south presently the ecliptic latitude is 43.5° south but it has decreased by a fraction of a degree since ptolemys time due to proper motion in ptolemys time alpha centauri was visible from alexandria egypt at 31° n but due to precession its declination is now –60° 51′ south and it can no longer be seen at that latitude english explorer robert hues brought alpha centauri to the attention of european observers in his 1592 work tractatus de globis along with canopus and achernar noting

now therefore there are but three stars of the first magnitude that i could perceive in all those parts which are never seene here in england the first of these is that bright star in the sterne of argo which they call canobus the second achernar is in the end of eridanus the third alpha centauri is in the right foote of the centaure
the binary nature of alpha centauri ab was recognised in december 1689 by jean richaud while observing a passing comet from his station in puducherry alpha centauri was only the second binary star to be discovered preceded by alpha crucisthe large proper motion of alpha centauri ab was discovered by manuel john johnson observing from saint helena who informed thomas henderson at the royal observatory cape of good hope of it the parallax of alpha centauri was subsequently determined by henderson from many exacting positional observations of the ab system between april 1832 and may 1833 he withheld his results however because he suspected they were too large to be true but eventually published them in 1839 after friedrich wilhelm bessel released his own accurately determined parallax for 61 cygni in 1838 for this reason alpha centauri is sometimes considered as the second star to have its distance measured because hendersons work was not fully acknowledged at first the distance of alpha centauri from the earth is now reckoned at 4.396 ly or 41.59 trillion km

later john herschel made the first micrometrical observations in 1834 since the early 20th century measures have been made with photographic platesby 1926 william stephen finsen calculated the approximate orbit elements close to those now accepted for this system all future positions are now sufficiently accurate for visual observers to determine the relative places of the stars from a binary star ephemeris others like d pourbaix 2002 have regularly refined the precision of new published orbital elementsrobert t a innes discovered proxima centauri in 1915 by blinking photographic plates taken at different times during a proper motion survey these showed large proper motion and parallax similar in both size and direction to those of alpha centauri ab suggesting that proxima centauri is part of the alpha centauri system and slightly closer to earth than alpha centauri ab lying 4.24 ly 1.30 pc away proxima centauri is the nearest star to the sun


 kinematics 

all components of alpha centauri display significant proper motion against the background sky over centuries this causes their apparent positions to slowly change proper motion was unknown to ancient astronomers most assumed that the stars are immortal and permanently fixed on the celestial sphere as stated in the works of the philosopher aristotle in 1718 edmond halley found that some stars had significantly moved from their ancient astrometric positionsin the 1830s thomas henderson discovered the true distance to alpha centauri by analysing his many astrometric mural circle observations he then realised this system also likely had a high proper motion in this case the apparent stellar motion was found using nicolas louis de lacailles astrometric observations of 1751–1752 by the observed differences between the two measured positions in different epochs
calculated proper motion of the centre of mass for alpha centauri ab is about 3620 mas milli-arcseconds per year toward the west and 694 masy toward the north giving an overall motion of 3686 masy in a direction 11° north of west the motion of the centre of mass is about 6.1 arcmin each century or 1.02° each millennium the velocity in the western direction is 23.0 kms and in the northerly direction 4.4 kms using spectroscopy the mean radial velocity has been determined to be around 22.4 kms towards the solar systemsince alpha centauri ab is almost exactly in the plane of the milky way as viewed from earth there are many stars behind them in early may 2028 alpha centauri a will pass between us and a distant red star when there will be a 45% probability that an einstein ring will be observed other conjunctions will also occur in the coming decades allowing accurate measurement of proper motions and possibly giving information on planets


 predicted future changes 

as the stars of alpha centauri move closer to the solar system their measured proper motions trigonometric parallaxes and radial velocities slowly increase
these effects will continue until the star system reaches its nearest point to the sun and then reverse as the distance increases again furthermore other small changes also occur with the binary stars orbital elements for example in the apparent size of the semi-major axis of the orbital ellipse will increase by 0.03 arcsec per century also the observed position angles of the stars are also subject to small cumulative changes additional to position angle changes caused by the precession of the equinoxes as first determined by w h van den bos in 1926

based on the systems common known proper motion and radial velocities alpha centauri will continue to change its position in the sky significantly and will gradually brighten for example in about 6,200 ad α centauris true motion will cause an extremely rare first-magnitude stellar conjunction with β centauri forming a brilliant optical double star in the southern sky it will then pass just north of the southern cross or crux before moving northwest and up towards the present celestial equator and away from the galactic plane by about 29,700 ad in the present-day constellation of hydra alpha centauri will be 1.00 pc or 3.3 ly away though later calculations suggest 0.90 pc or 2.9 ly in 29,000 ad at nearest approach alpha centauri will attain a maximum apparent magnitude of −0.86 comparable to present-day magnitude of canopus but it will still not surpass that of sirius which will brighten incrementally over the next 60,000 years and will continue to be the brightest star as seen from earth other than the sun for the next 210,000 yearsabout 28,000 years from now the alpha centauri system will begin to slowly move away from the solar system and this bright yellow star will eventually fall below naked-eye visibility


 planetary system 


 confirmed planets 

only one planet has been confirmed for the alpha centauri system proxima centauri b it is slightly larger than the earth and orbits around proxima centauri in the habitable zone  the existence of proxima centauri b was announced in 2016 by the european southern observatory  it was found using the radial velocity method where periodic doppler shifts of spectral lines of the host star suggest an orbiting object


 controversial and hypothetical planets 


 alpha centauri bb 

in 2012 a planet around alpha centauri b was announced alpha centauri bb but in 2015 a new analysis concluded that it almost certainly does not exist and was just a spurious artefact of the data analysis


 unconfirmed discovery 
whilst ruling out the existence of alpha centauri bb a possible transit of a separate exoplanet in 2013 was observed  the transit event could correspond to a planetary body with a radius around 0.92 r⊕ this planet would most likely orbit alpha centauri b with an orbital period of 20.4 days or less with only a 5 percent chance of it having a longer orbit the median of the likely orbits is 12.4 days with an impact parameter of around 0–0.3 its orbit would likely have an eccentricity of 0.24 or less  like the probably spurious alpha centauri bb it likely has lakes of molten lava and would be far too close to alpha centauri b to harbour life


 hypothetical planets 
additional planets may exist in the alpha centauri system either orbiting alpha centauri a or alpha centauri b individually or in large orbits around alpha centauri ab because both stars are fairly similar to the sun for example in age and metallicity astronomers have been especially interested in making detailed searches for planets in the alpha centauri system several established planet-hunting teams have used various radial velocity or star transit methods in their searches around these two bright stars all the observational studies have so far failed to find evidence for brown dwarfs or gas giantsin 2009 computer simulations showed that a planet might have been able to form near the inner edge of alpha centauri bs habitable zone which extends from 0.5 to 0.9 au from the star certain special assumptions such as considering that the alpha centauri pair may have initially formed with a wider separation and later moved closer to each other as might be possible if they formed in a dense star cluster would permit an accretion-friendly environment farther from the star bodies around alpha centauri a would be able to orbit at slightly farther distances due to its stronger gravity in addition the lack of any brown dwarfs or gas giants in close orbits around alpha centauri make the likelihood of terrestrial planets greater than otherwise a theoretical study indicates that a radial velocity analysis might detect a hypothetical planet of 1.8 m⊕ in alpha centauri bs habitable zoneradial velocity measurements of alpha centauri b with high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher spectrograph ruled out planets of more than 4 m⊕ to the distance of the habitable zone of the star orbital period p  200 dayscurrent estimates place the probability of finding an earth-like planet around alpha centauri at roughly 85 the observational thresholds for planet detection in the habitable zones by the radial velocity method are currently 2017 estimated to be about 50 m⊕ for alpha centauri a 8 m⊕ for alpha centauri b and 0.5 m⊕ for proxima centauriearly computer-generated models of planetary formation predicted the existence of terrestrial planets around both alpha centauri a and b but most recent numerical investigations have shown that the gravitational pull of the companion star renders the accretion of planets difficult despite these difficulties given the similarities to the sun in spectral types star type age and probable stability of the orbits it has been suggested that this stellar system could hold one of the best possibilities for harbouring extraterrestrial life on a potential planetin the solar system jupiter and saturn were probably crucial in perturbing comets into the inner solar system providing the inner planets with a source of water and various other ices in the alpha centauri system proxima centauri may have influenced the planetary disk as the alpha centauri system was forming enriching the area around alpha centauri with volatile materials this would be discounted if for example alpha centauri b happened to have gas giants orbiting alpha centauri a or conversely alpha centauri a for alpha centauri b or if alpha centauri a and b themselves were able to perturb comets into each others inner system as jupiter and saturn presumably have done in the solar system such icy bodies probably also reside in oort clouds of other planetary systems  when they are influenced gravitationally by either the gas giants or disruptions by passing nearby stars many of these icy bodies then travel starwards such ideas also apply to the close approach of alpha centauri or other stars to the solar system when in the distant future the oort cloud might be disrupted enough to increase the number of active cometsto be in the habitable zone a planet around alpha centauri a would have an orbital radius of about 1.25 au  so as to have similar planetary temperatures and conditions for liquid water to exist for the slightly less luminous and cooler alpha centauri b the habitable zone is closer at about 0.7 au 100 million kmwith the goal of finding evidence of such planets both proxima centauri and alpha centauri ab were among the listed tier 1 target stars for nasas space interferometry mission sim detecting planets as small as three earth-masses or smaller within two astronomical units of a tier 1 target would have been possible with this new instrument the sim mission however was cancelled due to financial issues in 2010


 circumstellar discs 
based on observations between 2007 and 2012 a study found a slight excess of emissions in the 24 μm midfar-infrared band surrounding α centauri ab which may be interpreted as evidence for a sparse circumstellar disc or dense interplanetary dust the total mass was estimated to be between 10−7 to 10−6 the mass of the moon or 10–100 times the mass of the solar systems zodiacal cloud if such a disc existed around both stars α centauri as disc would likely be stable to 2.8 au and α centauri bs would likely be stable to 2.5 au this would put as disc entirely within the frost line and a small part of bs outer disc just outside


 view from this system 

the sky from alpha centauri ab would appear much as it does from the earth except that centaurus would be missing its brightest star the sun would appear as a yellow star of apparent magnitude 0.5 roughly the same as the average brightness of betelgeuse from earth it would be at the antipodal point of alpha centauri abs current right ascension and declination at  02h 39m 35s 60° 50′ 2000 in eastern cassiopeia easily outshining all the rest of the stars in the constellation with the placement of the sun east of the 3.4-magnitude star ε cassiopeiae it would be nearly in front of the heart nebula and the w of cassiopeia would appear as a w shapethe winter triangle would have a very different appearance with procyon outshining pollux in the middle of gemini and sirius lying less than a degree from betelgeuse in orion with a magnitude of −1.2 sirius would be a little fainter than from earth but still the brightest star in the night sky both vega and altair would be shifted northwestward relative to deneb giving the summer triangle a more equilateral appearancealpha centauri is inside the g-cloud and its nearest known system is the binary brown dwarf system luhman 16 at 3.6 ly 1.1 pc

 future exploration 

alpha centauri is a likely first target for manned or unmanned interstellar exploration using current spacecraft technologies crossing the distance between the sun and alpha centauri would take several millennia though the possibility of nuclear pulse propulsion or laser light sail technology as considered in the breakthrough starshot program could reduce the journey time to decades an objective of such a mission would be to make a fly-by of and possibly photograph planets that might exist in the system the existence of proxima centauri b announced by the european southern observatory eso in august 2016 would be a target for the starshot programin january 2017 breakthrough initiatives and the eso entered a collaboration to search for habitable planets in the alpha centauri system the agreement involves breakthrough initiatives providing funding for an upgrade to the visir vlt imager and spectrometer for mid-infrared instrument on esos very large telescope vlt in chile this upgrade will greatly increase the likelihood of planet detection in the system
