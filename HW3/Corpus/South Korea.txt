 etymology 

the name korea derives from the name goryeo the name goryeo itself was first used by the ancient kingdom of goguryeo in the 5th century as a shortened form of its name the 10th-century kingdom of goryeo succeeded goguryeo and thus inherited its name which was pronounced by the visiting persian merchants as korea the modern spelling of korea first appeared in the late 17th century in the travel writings of the dutch east india companys hendrick hamel despite the coexistence of the spellings corea and korea in 19th century publications some koreans believe that imperial japan around the time of the japanese occupation intentionally standardised the spelling on korea making japan appear first alphabeticallyafter goryeo was replaced by joseon in 1392 joseon became the official name for the entire territory though it was not universally accepted the new official name has its origin in the ancient country of gojoseon old joseon in 1897 the joseon dynasty changed the official name of the country from joseon to daehan jeguk korean empire the name daehan which means great han literally derives from samhan three hans referring to the three kingdoms of korea not the ancient confederacies in the southern korean peninsula however the name joseon was still widely used by koreans to refer to their country though it was no longer the official name under japanese rule the two names han and joseon coexisted there were several groups who fought for independence the most notable being the provisional government of the republic of korea 대한민국 임시정부大韓民國臨時政府
following the surrender of japan in 1945 the republic of korea 대한민국大韓民國 ipa ˈtɛ̝ːɦa̠nminɡuk̚ lit great korean peoples state listen was adopted as the legal english name for the new country since the government only controlled the southern part of the korean peninsula the informal term south korea was coined becoming increasingly common in the western world while south koreans use han or hanguk to refer to the entire country north koreans and ethnic koreans living in china and japan use the term joseon as the name of the country the korean name daehan minguk is sometimes used by south koreans as a metonym to refer to the korean ethnicity or race as a whole rather than just the south korean state


 history 


 ancient korea 

the history of korea begins with the founding of joseon also known as gojoseon or old joseon to differentiate it with the 14th century dynasty in 2333 bce by dangun according to koreas foundation mythology gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern korean peninsula and parts of manchuria gija joseon was purportedly founded in the 12th century bc but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era in 108 bce the han dynasty defeated wiman joseon and installed four commanderies in the northern korean peninsula three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades as lelang commandery was destroyed and rebuilt around this time the place gradually moved toward liaodong thus its force was diminished and it only served as a trade center until it was conquered by goguryeo in 313


 three kingdoms of korea 
during the period known as the proto–three kingdoms of korea the states of buyeo okjeo dongye and samhan occupied the whole korean peninsula and southern manchuria from them goguryeo baekje and silla emerged to control the peninsula as the three kingdoms of korea goguryeo the largest and most powerful among them was a highly militaristic state and competed with various chinese dynasties during its 700 years of history goguryeo experienced a golden age under gwanggaeto the great and his son jangsu who both subdued baekje and silla during their times achieving a brief unification of the three kingdoms of korea and becoming the most dominant power on the korean peninsula in addition to contesting for control of the korean peninsula goguryeo had many military conflicts with various chinese dynasties most notably the goguryeo–sui war in which goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men baekje was a great maritime power its nautical skill which made it the phoenicia of east asia was instrumental in the dissemination of buddhism throughout east asia and continental culture to japan baekje was once a great military power on the korean peninsula especially during the time of geunchogo but was critically defeated by gwanggaeto the great and declined silla was the smallest and weakest of the three but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful korean kingdoms and eventually tang china to its great advantagethe unification of the three kingdoms by silla in 676 led to the north south states period in which much of the korean peninsula was controlled by later silla while balhae controlled the northern parts of goguryeo balhae was founded by a goguryeo general and formed as a successor state to goguryeo during its height balhae controlled most of manchuria and parts of the russian far east and was called the prosperous country in the east later silla was a golden age of art and culture as evidenced by the hwangnyongsa seokguram and emille bell relationships between korea and china remained relatively peaceful during this time later silla carried on the maritime prowess of baekje which acted like the phoenicia of medieval east asia and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of east asia and the trade between china korea and japan most notably during the time of jang bogo in addition silla people made overseas communities in china on the shandong peninsula and the mouth of the yangtze river later silla was a prosperous and wealthy country and its metropolitan capital of gyeongju was the fourth largest city in the world buddhism flourished during this time and many korean buddhists gained great fame among chinese buddhists and contributed to chinese buddhism including woncheuk wonhyo uisang musang and kim gyo-gak a silla prince whose influence made mount jiuhua one of the four sacred mountains of chinese buddhism however later silla weakened under internal strife and the revival of baekje and goguryeo which led to the later three kingdoms period in the late 9th century


 unified dynasties 

in 936 the later three kingdoms were united by wang geon a descendant of goguryeo nobility who established goryeo as the successor state of goguryeo balhae had fallen to the khitan empire in 926 and a decade later the last crown prince of balhae fled south to goryeo where he was warmly welcomed and included into the ruling family by wang geon thus unifying the two successor nations of goguryeo like silla goryeo was a highly cultural state and invented the metal movable type printing press after defeating the khitan empire which was the most powerful empire of its time in the goryeo–khitan war goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century during which the tripitaka koreana was completed and there were great developments in printing and publishing promoting learning and dispersing knowledge on philosophy literature religion and science by 1100 there were 12 universities that produced famous scholars and scientists however the mongol invasions in the 13th century greatly weakened the kingdom goryeo was never conquered by the mongols but exhausted after three decades of fighting the korean court sent its crown prince to the yuan capital to swear allegiance to kublai khan who accepted and married one of his daughters to the korean crown prince henceforth goryeo continued to rule korea though as a tributary ally to the mongols for the next 86 years during this period the two nations became intertwined as all subsequent korean kings married mongol princesses and the last empress of the yuan dynasty was a korean princess in the mid-14th century goryeo drove out the mongols to regain its northern territories briefly conquered liaoyang and defeated invasions by the red turbans however in 1392 general yi seong-gye who had been ordered to attack china turned his army around and staged a coup
yi seong-gye declared the new name of korea as joseon in reference to gojoseon and moved the capital to hanseong one of the old names of seoul the first 200 years of the joseon dynasty were marked by peace and saw great advancements in science and education as well as the creation of hangul by sejong the great to promote literacy among the common people the prevailing ideology of the time was neo-confucianism which was epitomized by the seonbi class nobles who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity between 1592 and 1598 toyotomi hideyoshi launched invasions of korea but his advance was halted by korean forces most notably the joseon navy led by admiral yi sun-sin and his renowned turtle ship with assistance from righteous army militias formed by korean civilians and ming dynasty chinese troops through a series of successful battles of attrition the japanese forces were eventually forced to withdraw and relations between all parties became normalized however the manchus took advantage of joseons war-weakened state and invaded in 1627 and 1637 and then went on to conquer the destabilized ming dynasty after normalizing relations with the new qing dynasty joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace kings yeongjo and jeongjo particularly led a new renaissance of the joseon dynasty during the 18th century in the 19th century the royal in-law families gained control of the government leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state and severe poverty and peasant rebellions throughout the country furthermore the joseon government adopted a strict isolationist policy earning the nickname the hermit kingdom but ultimately failed to protect itself against imperialism and was forced to open its borders after the first sino-japanese war and the russo-japanese war korea was occupied by japan 1910–45 at the end of world war ii the japanese surrendered to soviet and us forces who occupied the northern and southern halves of korea respectively


 modern history 

despite the initial plan of a unified korea in the 1943 cairo declaration escalating cold war antagonism between the soviet union and the united states eventually led to the establishment of separate governments each with its own ideology leading to the division of korea into two political entities in 1948 north korea and south korea in the south syngman rhee an opponent of communism who had been backed and appointed by the united states as head of the provisional government won the first presidential elections of the newly declared republic of korea in may in the north however a former anti-japanese guerrilla and communist activist kim il-sung was appointed premier of the democratic peoples republic of korea in september
in october the soviet union declared kim il-sungs government as sovereign over both parts the un declared rhees government as a lawful government having effective control and jurisdiction over that part of korea where the un temporary commission on korea was able to observe and consult and the government based on elections which was observed by the temporary commission in addition to a statement that this is the only such government in korea both leaders began an authoritarian repression of their political opponents inside their region seeking for a unification of korea under their control while south koreas request for military support was denied by the united states north koreas military was heavily reinforced by the soviet union


 korean war 
on june 25 1950 north korea invaded south korea sparking the korean war the cold wars first major conflict which continued until 1953 at the time the soviet union had boycotted the united nations un thus forfeiting their veto rights this allowed the un to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior north korean forces would unify the entire country the soviet union and china backed north korea with the later participation of millions of chinese troops after an ebb and flow that saw both sides almost pushed to the brink of extinction and massive losses among korean civilians in both the north and the south the war eventually reached a stalemate the 1953 armistice never signed by south korea split the peninsula along the demilitarized zone near the original demarcation line no peace treaty was ever signed resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war over 1.2 million people died during the korean war


 post-korean war 1960–1990 

in 1960 a student uprising the april 19 revolution led to the resignation of the autocratic president syngman rhee a period of political instability followed broken by general park chung-hees may 16 coup against the weak and ineffectual government the next year park took over as president until his assassination in 1979 overseeing rapid export-led economic growth as well as implementing political repression park was heavily criticised as a ruthless military dictator who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a new constitution which gave the president sweeping almost dictatorial powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms however the korean economy developed significantly during parks tenure and the government developed the nationwide expressway system the seoul subway system and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure
the years after parks assassination were marked again by political turmoil as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void in 1979 there came the coup détat of december twelfth led by general chun doo-hwan following the coup détat chun doo-hwan planned to rise to power through several measures on may 17 chun doo-hwan forced the cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation which had previously not applied to the island of jejudo the expanded martial law closed universities banned political activities and further curtailed the press chuns assumption of the presidency in the events of may 17 triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy in particular in the city of gwangju to which chun sent special forces to violently suppress the gwangju democratization movementchun subsequently created the national defense emergency policy committee and took the presidency according to his political plan chun and his government held south korea under a despotic rule until 1987 when a seoul national university student park jong-chul was tortured to death on june 10 the catholic priests association for justice revealed the incident igniting the june democracy movement around the country eventually chuns party the democratic justice party and its leader roh tae-woo announced the 6.29 declaration which included the direct election of the president roh went on to win the election by a narrow margin against the two main opposition leaders kim dae-jung and kim young-sam seoul hosted the olympic games in 1988 widely regarded as successful and a significant boost for south koreas global image and economysouth korea was formally invited to become a member of the united nations in 1991 the transition of korean from autocracy to modern democracy was marked in 1997 by the election of kim dae-jung who was sworn in as the eighth president of south korea on february 25 1998 his election was significant given that he had in earlier years been a political prisoner sentenced to death later commuted to exile he won against the backdrop of the 1997 asian financial crisis where he took imf advice to restructure the economy and the nation soon recovered its economic growth albeit at a slower pace


 modern south korea 

in june 2000 as part of president kim dae-jungs sunshine policy of engagement a north–south summit took place in pyongyang the capital of north korea later that year kim received the nobel peace prize for his work for democracy and human rights in south korea and in east asia in general and for peace and reconciliation with north korea in particular however because of discontent among the population for fruitless approaches to the north under the previous administrations and amid north korean provocations a conservative government was elected in 2007 led by president lee myung-bak former mayor of seoul meanwhile south korea and japan jointly co-hosted the 2002 fifa world cup however south korean and japanese relations later soured because of conflicting claims of sovereignty over the liancourt rocks

in 2010 there was an escalation in attacks by north korea in march 2010 the south korean warship roks cheonan was sunk with the loss of 46 south korean sailors allegedly by a north korean submarine in november 2010 yeonpyeong island was attacked by a significant north korean artillery barrage with 4 people losing their lives the lack of a strong response to these attacks from both south korea and the international community the official un report declined to explicitly name north korea as the perpetrator for the cheonan sinking caused significant anger with the south korean public south korea saw another milestone in 2012 with the first ever female president park geun-hye elected and assuming office daughter of another former president park chung-hee she carried on a conservative brand of politics president park geun-hyes administration was formally accused of corruption bribery and influence-peddling for the involvement of close friend choi soon-sil in state affairs there followed a series of massive public demonstrations from november 2016 and she was removed from office after the fallout of president parks impeachment and dismissal new elections were held and moon jae-in of the democratic party won the presidency assuming office on 10 may 2017 his tenure so far has seen an improving political relationship with north korea some increasing divergence in the military alliance with the united states and the successful hosting of the winter olympics in pyeongchang

 demographics 

in april 2016 south koreas population was estimated to be around 50.8 million by national statistical office with continuing decline of working age population and total fertility rate the country is noted for its population density which was an estimated 505 per square kilometer in 2015 more than 10 times the global average most south koreans live in urban areas because of rapid migration from the countryside during the countrys quick economic expansion in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s the capital city of seoul is also the countrys largest city and chief industrial center according to the 2005 census seoul had a population of 10 million inhabitants the seoul national capital area has 24.5 million inhabitants about half of south koreas entire population making it the worlds second largest metropolitan area other major cities include busan 3.5 million incheon 3.0 million daegu 2.5 million daejeon 1.4 million gwangju 1.4 million and ulsan 1.1 million

the population has also been shaped by international migration after world war ii and the division of the korean peninsula about four million people from north korea crossed the border to south korea this trend of net entry reversed over the next 40 years because of emigration especially to the united states and canada south koreas total population in 1955 was 21.5 million and has more than doubled to 50 million by 2010south korea is considered one of the most ethnically homogeneous societies in the world with ethnic koreans representing approximately 96% of total population precise numbers are difficult since statistics do not record ethnicity and given many immigrants are ethnically korean themselves whilst some korean citizens are not ethnically korean south korea is nevertheless becoming a more multi-ethnic society over time due to immigration
the percentage of foreign nationals has been growing rapidly as of  2016 south korea had 1,413,758 foreign residents 2.75% of the population however many of them are ethnic koreans with a foreign citizenship for example migrants from china prc make up 56.5% of foreign nationals but approximately 70% of the chinese citizens in korea are joseonjok 조선족 prc citizens of korean ethnicity regardless of the ethnicity there are 28,500 us military personnel serving in south korea most serving a one-year unaccompanied tour though approximately 10% serve longer tours accompanied by family according to the korea national statistical office in addition about 43,000 english teachers from english-speaking countries reside temporarily in korea currently south korea has one of the highest rates of growth of foreign born population with about 30,000 foreign born residents obtaining south korean citizenship every year since 2010

south koreas highly enviable academic performance has persuaded british education ministers to actively remodel their own curriculums and exams to try to emulate koreas militant drive and passion for excellence and high educational achievement former us president barack obama has also praised the countrys rigorous school system where over 80 percent of south korean high school graduates go on to university the nations high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making south korea among the most highly educated countries in the world with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree bachelors degrees are held by 68 percent of south koreans aged 25–34 the most in the oecdthe systems rigid and hierarchical structure has been criticized for stifling creativity and innovation described as intensely and brutally competitive the system is often blamed for the high suicide rate in the country particularly the growing rates among those aged 10–19 various media outlets attribute the countrys high suicide rate to the nationwide anxiety around the countrys college entrance exams which determine the trajectory of students entire lives and careers former south korean hagwon teacher se-woong koo wrote that the south korean education system amounts to child abuse and that it should be reformed and restructured without delay the system has also been criticized for producing an excess supply of university graduates creating an overeducated and underemployed labor force in the first quarter of 2013 alone nearly 3.3 million south korean university graduates were jobless leaving many graduates overqualified for jobs requiring less education further criticism has been stemmed for causing labor shortages in various skilled blue collar labor and vocational occupations where many go unfilled as the negative social stigma associated with vocational careers and not having a university degree continues to remain deep-rooted in south korean society
