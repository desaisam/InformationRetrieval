in physics specifically celestial mechanics escape velocity is the minimum speed needed for a free object to escape from the gravitational influence of a massive body it is slower the further away from the body an object is and slower for less massive bodies
the escape velocity from earth is about 11.186 kms 6.951 mis 40,270 kmh 36,700 fts 25,020 mph 21,744 kn at the surface more generally escape velocity is the speed at which the sum of an objects kinetic energy and its gravitational potential energy is equal to zero an object which has achieved escape velocity is neither on the surface nor in a closed orbit of any radius with escape velocity in a direction pointing away from the ground of a massive body the object will move away from the body slowing forever and approaching but never reaching zero speed  once escape velocity is achieved no further impulse need be applied for it to continue in its escape in other words if given escape velocity the object will move away from the other body continually slowing and will asymptotically approach zero speed as the objects distance approaches infinity never to come back speeds higher than escape velocity have a positive speed at infinity note that the minimum escape velocity assumes that there is no friction eg atmospheric drag which would increase the required instantaneous velocity to escape the gravitational influence and that there will be no future acceleration or deceleration for example from thrust or gravity from other objects which would change the required instantaneous velocity
for a spherically symmetric massive body such as a star or planet the escape velocity for that body at a given distance is calculated by the formula

  in these equations atmospheric friction air drag is not taken into account a rocket moving out of a gravity well does not actually need to attain escape velocity to escape but could achieve the same result escape at any speed with a suitable mode of propulsion and sufficient propellant to provide the accelerating force on the object to escape escape velocity is only required to send a ballistic object on a trajectory that will allow the object to escape the gravity well of the mass m


 overview 

the existence of escape velocity is a consequence of conservation of energy and an energy field of finite depth for an object with a given total energy which is moving subject to conservative forces such as a static gravity field it is only possible for the object to reach combinations of locations and speeds which have that total energy and places which have a higher potential energy than this cannot be reached at all by adding speed kinetic energy to the object it expands the possible locations that can be reached until with enough energy they become infinite
for a given gravitational potential energy at a given position the escape velocity is the minimum speed an object without propulsion needs to be able to escape from the gravity ie so that gravity will never manage to pull it back escape velocity is actually a speed not a velocity because it does not specify a direction no matter what the direction of travel is the object can escape the gravitational field provided its path does not intersect the planet
the simplest way of deriving the formula for escape velocity is to use conservation of energy  for the sake of simplicity unless stated otherwise we assume that an object is attempting to escape from a uniform spherical planet by moving away from it and that the only significant force acting on the moving object is the planets gravity in its initial state i imagine that a spaceship of mass m is at a distance r from the center of mass of the planet whose mass is m its initial speed is equal to its escape velocity

  where μ is the standard gravitational parameter
the same result is obtained by a relativistic calculation in which case the variable r represents the radial coordinate or reduced circumference of the schwarzschild metricdefined a little more formally escape velocity is the initial speed required to go from an initial point in a gravitational potential field to infinity and end at infinity with a residual speed of zero without any additional acceleration all speeds and velocities measured with respect to the field additionally the escape velocity at a point in space is equal to the speed that an object would have if it started at rest from an infinite distance and was pulled by gravity to that point
in common usage the initial point is on the surface of a planet or moon on the surface of the earth the escape velocity is about 11.2 kms which is approximately 33 times the speed of sound mach 33 and several times the muzzle velocity of a rifle bullet up to 1.7 kms however at 9,000 km altitude in space it is slightly less than 7.1 kms
the escape velocity is independent of the mass of the escaping object it does not matter if the mass is 1 kg or 1,000 kg what differs is the amount of energy required for an object of mass

 from a rotating body 
the escape velocity relative to the surface of a rotating body depends on direction in which the escaping body travels for example as the earths rotational velocity is 465 ms at the equator a rocket launched tangentially from the earths equator to the east requires an initial velocity of about 10.735 kms relative to earth to escape whereas a rocket launched tangentially from the earths equator to the west requires an initial velocity of about 11.665 kms relative to earth the surface velocity decreases with the cosine of the geographic latitude so space launch facilities are often located as close to the equator as feasible eg the american cape canaveral latitude 28°28 n and the french guiana space centre latitude 5°14 n


 practical considerations 
in most situations it is impractical to achieve escape velocity almost instantly because of the acceleration implied and also because if there is an atmosphere the hypersonic speeds involved on earth a speed of 11.2 kms or 40,320 kmh would cause most objects to burn up due to aerodynamic heating or be torn apart by atmospheric drag for an actual escape orbit a spacecraft will accelerate steadily out of the atmosphere until it reaches the escape velocity appropriate for its altitude which will be less than on the surface in many cases the spacecraft may be first placed in a parking orbit eg a low earth orbit at 160–2,000 km and then accelerated to the escape velocity at that altitude which will be slightly lower about 11.0 kms at a low earth orbit of 200 km the required additional change in speed however is far less because the spacecraft already has significant orbital velocity in low earth orbit speed is approximately 7.8 kms or 28,080 kmh


 from an orbiting body 
the escape velocity at a given height is

    displaystyle sqrt 2
   times the speed in a circular orbit at the same height compare this with the velocity equation in circular orbit this corresponds to the fact that the potential energy with respect to infinity of an object in such an orbit is minus two times its kinetic energy while to escape the sum of potential and kinetic energy needs to be at least zero the velocity corresponding to the circular orbit is sometimes called the first cosmic velocity whereas in this context the escape velocity is referred to as the second cosmic velocityfor a body in an elliptical orbit wishing to accelerate to an escape orbit the required speed will vary and will be greatest at periapsis when the body is closest to the central body however the orbital speed of the body will also be at its highest at this point and the change in velocity required will be at its lowest as explained by the oberth effect


 barycentric escape velocity 
technically escape velocity can either be measured as a relative to the other central body or relative to center of mass or barycenter of the system of bodies thus for systems of two bodies the term escape velocity can be ambiguous but it is usually intended to mean the barycentric escape velocity of the less massive body in gravitational fields escape velocity refers to the escape velocity of zero mass test particles relative to the barycenter of the masses generating the field in most situations involving spacecraft the difference is negligible for a mass equal to a saturn v rocket the escape velocity relative to the launch pad is 253.5 ams 8 nanometers per year faster than the escape velocity relative to the mutual center of mass

if an object attains exactly escape velocity but is not directed straight away from the planet then it will follow a curved path or trajectory although this trajectory does not form a closed shape it can be referred to as an orbit assuming that gravity is the only significant force in the system this objects speed at any point in the trajectory will be equal to the escape velocity at that point due to the conservation of energy its total energy must always be 0 which implies that it always has escape velocity see the derivation above the shape of the trajectory will be a parabola whose focus is located at the center of mass of the planet an actual escape requires a course with a trajectory that does not intersect with the planet or its atmosphere since this would cause the object to crash when moving away from the source this path is called an escape orbit escape orbits are known as c3  0 orbits c3 is the characteristic energy  −gm2a where a is the semi-major axis which is infinite for parabolic trajectories
if the body has a velocity greater than escape velocity then its path will form a hyperbolic trajectory and it will have an excess hyperbolic velocity equivalent to the extra energy the body has a relatively small extra delta-v above that needed to accelerate to the escape speed can result in a relatively large speed at infinity for example at a place where escape speed is 11.2 kms the addition of 0.4 kms yields a hyperbolic excess speed of 3.02 kms

  if a body in circular orbit or at the periapsis of an elliptical orbit accelerates along its direction of travel to escape velocity the point of acceleration will form the periapsis of the escape trajectory the eventual direction of travel will be at 90 degrees to the direction at the point of acceleration if the body accelerates to beyond escape velocity the eventual direction of travel will be at a smaller angle and indicated by one of the asymptotes of the hyperbolic trajectory it is now taking this means the timing of the acceleration is critical if the intention is to escape in a particular direction


 multiple bodies 
when escaping a compound system such as a moon orbiting a planet or a planet orbiting a sun a rocket that leaves at escape velocity 
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            e
            1
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle ve1
   for the first orbiting body eg earth will not travel to an infinite distance because it needs an even higher speed to escape gravity of the second body eg the sun near the earth the rockets trajectory will appear parabolic but it will still be gravitationally bound to the second body and will enter an elliptical orbit around that body with a similar orbital speed to the first body
to escape the gravity of the second body once it has escaped the first body the rocket will need to be travelling at the escape velocity for the second body 
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            e
            2
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle ve2
   at the orbital distance of the first body however when the rocket escapes the first body it will still have the same orbital speed around the second body that the first body has 
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            o
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle vo
   so its excess velocity as it escapes the first body will need to be the difference between the orbital velocity and the escape velocity with a circular orbit escape velocity is √2 times the orbital speed thus the total escape velocity

 deriving escape velocity using calculus 
let g be the gravitational constant and let m be the mass of the earth or other gravitating body and m be the mass of the escaping body or projectile at a distance r from the centre of gravitation the body feels an attractive force
