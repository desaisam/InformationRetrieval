the timeline of discovery of solar system planets and their natural satellites charts the progress of the discovery of new bodies over history each object is listed in chronological order of its discovery multiple dates occur when the moments of imaging observation and publication differ identified through its various designations including temporary and permanent schemes and the discoverers listed
historically the naming of moons did not always match the times of their discovery traditionally the discoverer enjoys the privilege of naming the new object however some neglected to do so e e barnard stated he would defer any suggestions as to a name for amalthea until a later paper but never got around to picking one from the numerous suggestions he received or actively declined s b nicholson stated many have asked what the new satellites lysithea and carme are to be named they will be known only by the numbers x and xi written in roman numerals and usually prefixed by the letter j to identify them with jupiter the issue arose nearly as soon as planetary satellites were discovered galileo referred to the four main satellites of jupiter using numbers while the names suggested by his rival simon marius gradually gained universal acceptance the international astronomical union iau eventually started officially approving names in the late 1970s


 key 
in the following tables planetary satellites are indicated in bold type eg moon while planets and dwarf planets which directly circle the sun are in italic type eg earth the sun itself is indicated in roman type the tables are sorted by publicationannouncement date dates are annotated with the following symbols

i for date of first imaging photography etc
o for date of first human visual observation either through telescope or on photographic plate
p for date of announcement or publicationin a few cases the date is uncertain and is then marked 
 note moons marked by an asterisk  had complicated discoveries some took years to be confirmed and in several cases were actually lost and rediscovered others were found in voyager photographs years after they were taken
