comet 30preinmuth also known as comet reinmuth 1 is a periodic comet in the solar system first discovered by karl reinmuth landessternwarte heidelberg-k√∂nigstuhl germany on february 22 1928
first calculations of orbit concluded a period of 25 years but this was revised down to seven years and speculation this was the same comet as comet taylor which had been lost since 1915 further calculations by george van biesbroeck concluded they were different comets
the 1935 approach was observed though not as favourable in 1937 the comet passed close to jupiter which increased the perihelion distance and orbital period
due to miscalculations the 1942 appearance was missed but it has been observed on every subsequent appearance since
the comet nucleus is estimated to be 7.8 kilometers in diameter
