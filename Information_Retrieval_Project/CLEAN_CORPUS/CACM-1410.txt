interarrival statistics for time sharing systems the optimization of time shared system performance requires the description stochastic processes governing user inputs and program activity this paper provides a statistical input process in sdc arpa general purpose system tss is assumed to be stationary defined by interarrival distribution data obtained appear justify satisfactorily common assumption that times are serially independent do not except as very rough approximation usual off an exponential a much more satisfactory can with biphase or triphase hyperexponential cacm july 1966 coffman e g wood r c ca660704 jb march 2 1978 9 45 pm 1410 5 1604 1951 2373 1224 6 1751 1810 2374
