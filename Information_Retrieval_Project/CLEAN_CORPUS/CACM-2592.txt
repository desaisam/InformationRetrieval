on generation of test problems for linear programming codes users linear programming computer codes have realized the necessity evaluating capacity effectiveness and accuracy solutions provided by such large scale at most installations are assumed to be generating correct without ever having been bench marked test problems with known the reason this failure adequately is that rarely there large readily available this paper presents a theoretical justification an illustrative implementation method permits generation arbitrary size wide range numerical characteristics cacm october 1974 charnes a raike w m stutz j d walters s problem lp program evaluation validation 5 41 ca741006 jb january 16 1978 12 28 pm 2592
