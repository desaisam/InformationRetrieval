numerical integration of function that has a pole it is common to need integrate numerically functions that diverge somewhere outside the range integration even if divergence occurs quite far away formulas like simpson s depend on fitting polynomial usually will be inaccurate near pole they very bad a method described gives this kind accurately orders and positions poles are known explicit given easy use an automatic computer shown can used for some other singularities as well if integral converges carried singularity the accuracy with second order discussed example new formula compared useful even from while their advantage overwhelming cacm april 1967 eisner e ca670407 jb february 28 1978 11 20 am 1608 5
