global optimization by suppression of partial redundancies the elimination redundant computations and the moving invariant out loops are often done separately with invariants moved outward loop we propose to do both at once move each expression directly entrance outermost in which it is this solving a more general problem i e performed twice on given execution path such termed partially moreover algorithm does not require any graphical information or restrictions shape program graph testing this has shown that its cost nearly linear size leads smaller optimizer requires less time cacm february 1979 morel e renvoise c optimizer optimization compiler compilation redundancy computation partial data flow analysis boolean systems 4 12 5 21 24 ca790204 dh april 10 19 pm 3125
