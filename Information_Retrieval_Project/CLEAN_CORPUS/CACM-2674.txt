scan conversion algorithms for a cell organized raster display scan computer graphics with real time character generators have previously been limited to alphanumeric characters a display has described which extends the capabilities of this organization include general two fundamentally different conversion algorithms developed support are presented one is most suitable non interactive applications and other the were implemented in fortran on cdc 6400 results obtained from implementations show that noninteractive can significantly reduce file storage requirements at little cost execution over conventional raster algorithm improve response cacm march 1974 barrett r c fordan b w jr line drawing discrete image dot generation matrix displays 4 41 6 35 8 2 ca740309 jb january 18 1978 11 08 am 1891 2674 2211 2421 2687 2828 1741 5 2004
