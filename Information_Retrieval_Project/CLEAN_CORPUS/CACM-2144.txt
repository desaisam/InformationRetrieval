on accurate floating point summation the accumulation of floating point sums is considered on a computer which performs t digit base b addition with exponents in the range m to m an algorithm given for accurately summing n numbers each these split into q parts forming qn then added appropriate one n auxiliary accumulators finally are together yield computed sum in all 1 additions performed under usual conditions relative error at most v some further an additional can be corrected full accuracy for example ibm 360 16 14 63 64 typical values and 2 32 this case becomes 768 we have 4x16 13 cacm november 1971 malcolm a summation analysis 5 11 19 ca711105 jb february 1978 10 48 am 1328 4 2144 1333 1052
