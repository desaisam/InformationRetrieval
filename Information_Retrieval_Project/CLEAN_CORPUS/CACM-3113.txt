optimal conversion of extended entry decision tables with general cost criteria a general dynamic programming algorithm for converting limited extended or mixed entry decision tables to optimal trees is presented which can take into account rule frequencies probabilities minimum time and space cost criteria common action sets compressed rules else sequencing constraints on condition tests excludable combinations conditions certain ambiguities interrupted masking cacm april 1978 lew table programs 3 59 4 19 29 49 5 39 42 8 ca780403 dh february 26 1979 37 pm 1684 3113 2053 2220 2273 2453 2598 2691 2726 2845 2856 3033 1354 2263
