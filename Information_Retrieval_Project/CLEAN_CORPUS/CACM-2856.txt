the synthetic approach to decision table conversion previous approaches the problem of automatically converting decision tables computer programs have been based on decomposition at any stage one condition is selected for testing and two smaller problems with less are created an optimal program respect average execution time or storage space example located only through implicit enumeration all possible trees using a technique such as branch bound new approach described in this paper uses dynamic programming synthesize an tree from which can be using efficiency creating increased substantially permitting generation many ten twelve conditions cacm june 1976 schumacher h sevcik k c 3 50 4 12 5 30 8 ca760606 jb january 1978 1 pm 1354 2856 1488 1684 2053 2220 2221 2273 2453 2517 2598 2726 2845 3034 3113 1172 1327 3033 6 2263 2691
