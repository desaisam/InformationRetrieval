least squares fitting of planes to surfaces using dynamic programming programming has recently been used by stone bellman and gluss determine the closet fit broken line segments a curve in an interval under constraint that number is fixed in present paper successive models are developed extend method fitting plane surfaces z g x y defined over certain types subareas space the first model considers rectangular area with grid it then shown how this may be incorporated into algorithm provides approximations optimal fits for any type closed finally applications briefly described cacm april 1963 b ca630424 jb march 14 1978 11 43 am 497 4 867 317 5
