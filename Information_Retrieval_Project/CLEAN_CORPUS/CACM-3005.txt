implications of structured programming for machine architecture based on an empirical study more than 10 000 lines program text written in a goto less language machine architecture specifically designed structured programs is proposed since assignment call return and if statements together account 93 percent all executable special care given to ensure that these can be implemented efficiently a highly compact instruction encoding scheme presented which reduce size by factor 3 unlike huffman code utilizes variable length fields this method uses only fixed 1 byte op address the most frequent instructions consist single field as consequence decoding time minimized the efficient with respect both space cacm march 1978 tanenbaum computer organization set design characteristics 4 12 22 9 6 21 ca780308 jb 28 55 pm 2411 3005 2709 2889 2937 2989 3025 3101 2138 5
