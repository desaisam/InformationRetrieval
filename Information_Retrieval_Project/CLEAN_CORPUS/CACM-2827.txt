a parametric algorithm for drawing pictures of solid objects composed quadric surfaces an algorithm drawing pictures three dimensional objects with surfaces made up patches quadric is described the emphasis this on calculating the intersections parameterization scheme used each surface intersection curve qsic represented as a set coefficients and parameter limits value represents at most two points these may easily be distinguished this can find coordinates even quartic fourth order curves using equations no more than second methods each type osic are discussed well bounding hidden removal cacm october 1976 levin j computer graphics 3 41 5 12 13 19 8 2 ca761004 jb january 1978 4 32 pm 2816 2827 2828 2913 3047 3116 2751 2771
