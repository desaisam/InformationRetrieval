achieving specific accuracy in simulation output analysis this paper extends the use of regenerative property queueing systems analysis simulation output in particular it describes a sequential estimation method which when used with allows results to be obtained specified statistical accuracy includes test check normality assumption on procedure relies the illustrates using empty and idle state as a second example then how most frequently entered reduces chance making costly error preliminary run also described variance reduction due page 9 can obtain considerably fewer job completions than are required no technique is applied cacm may 1977 fishman g s confidence terval ratio estimator stopping rule 5 8 1 ca770502 jb december 29 2 43 am 2970
