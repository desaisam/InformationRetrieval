on the computer enumeration of finite topologies the problem enumerating number topologies which can be formed from a finite point set is considered both theoretically and computationally certain fundamental results are established leading to an algorithm for computed given n 7 an interesting side result computational work was unearthing theoretical error had been induced into literature use computer in combinatorics represents chronologically early application this underscores its continuing usefulness area cacm may 1967 evans j w harary f lynn m s ca670507 jb february 28 1978 10 37 am 1595 5
