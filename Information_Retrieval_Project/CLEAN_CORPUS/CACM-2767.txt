a comparison of simulation event list algorithms four algorithms are considered which can be used to schedule events in a general purpose discrete simulation system two the new one is based on an end order tree structure for event notices and another uses indexed linear list the tested with set typical stochastic scheduling distributions especially chosen show advantages limitations algorithm shown advantageous immediate replacement use current languages most promising concept it will require adaptive routine before it employed simulators but its performance such that further study would fruitful cacm april 1975 vaucher j g duval p time flow mechanisms executive sorting 3 74 4 22 8 1 ca750410 jb january 9 1978 43 pm 2767 3064 1939 5 2844 2936 3051 3109 970 6 1059 1846 2742
