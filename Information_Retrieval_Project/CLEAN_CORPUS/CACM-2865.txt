verifying properties of parallel programs an axiomatic approach axiomatic method for proving a number properties parallel programs is presented hoare has given set axioms partial correctness but they are not strong enough in most cases this paper defines more powerful deductive system which some sense complete a crucial axiom provides the use auxiliary variables added to program as an aid it correct the information proof can be used prove such mutual exclusion freedom from deadlock and termination techniques verifying these illustrated by application dining philosophers problem cacm may 1976 owicki s gries d structured multiprogramming proofs verification concurrent processes synchronization 4 32 35 5 21 24 ca760506 jb january 1978 3 23 pm 2021 2865 2222 2227 2315 2326 2470 2732 2866 2896 2898 2943 2972 3014 3043 3068 3077 3128 3143 3144 1834 2597 3148 1860 6 2150 2376 2436 2817 2870 2912 2939 3073 3082
