incorporating origin shifts into the qr algorithm for symmetric tridiagonal matrices the iteration eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix can be accelerated by incorporating sequence origin shifts shift may either subtracted directly from diagonal elements or incorporated means an implicit algorithm both methods have drawbacks direct method unnecessarily degrade small while effectively loose and thereby retard convergence this paper presents new which has neither drawback cacm june 1970 stewart g w eigenvectors 5 14 ca700608 jb february 13 1978 11 02 am 2047
