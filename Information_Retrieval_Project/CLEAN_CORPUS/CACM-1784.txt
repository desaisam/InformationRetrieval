practical error coefficients for estimating quadrature errors analytic functions all published error coefficients estimating quadrature errors analytic functions were computed on the assumption that rule was exact polynomials up to a given degree since these rules use rounded values abscissas and weights since true of integrals some in question have an infinite binary expression is not hence must be taken into consideration computing practical cacm january 1968 rabinowitz p numerical integration truncation theoretical analytical roundoff 5 11 16 ca680110 jb february 23 1978 2 22 pm 1672 1784 6
