nonlinear regression and the solution of simultaneous equations if one has a set observables z1 zm which are bound in relation with certain parameters a1 an by an equation s 0 frequently problem determining values ai minimizes sum squares differences between observed calculated distinguished observable say solution above for n gives rise to function is nonlinear then may rely on version gaussian regression 1 2 iteration scheme that converges minimizing it shown here this same minimization technique be used simultaneous not necessarily linear equations cacm july 1962 baer r m ca620725 jb march 17 1978 8 09 pm 536 5
