a simple user oriented compiler source language for programming automatic test equipment for the nonprogrammer difficulty in using a language increases rapidly with number of nonproblem oriented conventions simple even if inelegant which considers user s background as part problem may be more effective than source containing subtle and powerful capabilities the described this paper is used to write computer programs test electronic equipment because testing process contains few complex ideas there little need elegance redundancy highly syntax direct will suffice eventual users are military depot personnel who cannot he expected have programming skill or significant training nonprogramming it was essential create familiar engineering statements would unnecessarily complicated his task cacm april 1966 scheff b h ca660401 jb march 3 1978 11 09 am 1454 5
