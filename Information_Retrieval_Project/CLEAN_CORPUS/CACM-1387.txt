solution of systems polynomial equations by elimination the elimination procedure as described by williams has been coded in lisp and formac used solving systems polynomial equations it is found that the method very effective case small where it yields all solutions without need for initial estimates itself appears appropriate however solution large equation due to explosive growth intermediate hazards which arise when coefficients are truncated a comparison made with difficulties other problems non numerical mathematics such symbolic integration simplification cacm august 1966 moses j ca660811 jb march 2 1978 7 11 pm 1396 5 1387 1946 878 6 902 964 1028 1029 1083 1093 1132 1177 1214 1278 1334 1365 1386 1388 1392 1393 1394 1395 1397 1496 284 360 407 3199 3200 3201 3202 3203 3204 561 730 731
