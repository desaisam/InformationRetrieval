n dimensional codes for detecting and correcting multiple errors the paper introduces a new family of codes detecting correcting multiple errors in binary coded message itself is arranged conceptually into multidimensional rectangular array processes encoding error detection are based upon parity evaluations along prescribed dimensions the effectiveness increased by introducing system check bit which essentially on other bits only three dimensional discussed this with horizontal vertical one main diagonal however not restricted to as evidenced discussion minnick ashenhurst similar single selection plan used another purpose 6 a four code has been developed extension higher greater correction power straightforward cacm december 1961 rubinoff m ca611207 jb march 15 1978 10 23 pm 243 5
