an exponential method for the solution of systems ordinary differential equations explicit coupled single step method numerical solution initial value problems systems ordinary differential equations is presented the was designed to be general purpose in nature but especially efficient when dealing with stiff it second order except case a linear system constant coefficients and forcing terms that third has been implemented put routine usage biological applications where stiffness frequently appears favorable results when compared standard fourth runge kutta implementation computation time required by this ranged from comparable certain nonstiff better than two orders magnitude faster some highly cacm december 1974 chu s c berman m 5 17 ca741207 jb january 13 1978 4 20 pm 2567 2268 755
