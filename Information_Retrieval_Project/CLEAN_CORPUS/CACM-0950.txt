parallel methods for integrating ordinary differential equations this paper is dedicated to the proposition that in order take full advantage real time computations of highly parallel computers as can be expected available near future much numerical analysis will have recast a more form by this meant serial algorithms ought replaced by algorithm which consist several subtasks computed without knowledge results other as an example method proposed parallelizing integration ordinary differential equation process all standard methods entirely cacm december 1964 nievergelt j ca641221 jb march 9 1978 3 09 pm 950 5
