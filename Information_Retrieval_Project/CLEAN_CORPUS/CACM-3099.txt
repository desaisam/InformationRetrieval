new sufficient optimality conditions for integer programming and their application the purpose of this report is to present a new class sufficient optimality conditions pure mixed integer programming problems some the sets presented can be thought as generalizations based on primal dual complementarity in linear these are particularly useful construction difficult with known optimal solutions may then used test or benchmark codes cacm may 1978 fleisher j meyer r problem kuhn tucker greatest common divisor 3 15 5 39 49 ca780508 dh february 26 1979 1 19 pm 2028 4 3099 2521 3138 1313 2031
