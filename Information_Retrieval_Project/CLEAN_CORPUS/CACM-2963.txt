a fast algorithm for computing longest common subsequences previously published algorithms finding the longest common subsequence of two sequences length n have had a best case running time o 2 an algorithm this problem is presented which has r log where total number ordered pairs positions at match thus in worst however those applications most one sequence relatively few other can be expected cacm may 1977 hunt j w szymanski t g efficient 3 73 63 5 25 ca770509 jb december 29 1 46 am 2963 4 3114 2745
