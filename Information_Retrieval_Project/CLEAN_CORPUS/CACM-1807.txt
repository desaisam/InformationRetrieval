optimization of expressions in fortran a method optimizing the computation arithmetic and indexing expressions a program is presented the based on linear analysis definition points variables branching do loop structure objectives processing are 1 to eliminate redundant calculations when references made common subexpression values 2 remove invariant from loops 3 efficiently compute subscripts containing iteration 4 provide efficient index register usage requires at least three pass compiler second which scanned backward it has been used development several fortran compilers that have proved produce excellent object code without significantly reducing compilation speed cacm december 1969 busam v england d e optimization allocation subexpressions 12 ca691205 jb february 15 1978 16 pm 1625 1807 1781 1934 1945 1947 2034 2175 2290 2579 2923 2945 1223 5 1248 1551 1535 6
