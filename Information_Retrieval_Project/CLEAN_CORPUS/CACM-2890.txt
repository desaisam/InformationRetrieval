on quadratic adaptive routing algorithms two analytic models of a store and forward communications network are constructed one to find the optimal message routing other illustrate equilibrium stationary state maintained by an adaptive algorithm these show that does not satisfy necessary conditions for tends overuse direct path underuse alternate routes because it consider impact its current decision on future the form optimality suggests modification will result in requires substitution quadratic bias term instead linear table at each node simulation results presented which confirm theoretical analysis simple cacm january 1976 agnew c e algorithms distributed computer switching 3 81 8 0 1 ca760103 jb 5 1978 10 37 am 2890
