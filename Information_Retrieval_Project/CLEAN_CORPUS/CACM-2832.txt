faster retrieval from context trees corrigendum trees provide a convenient way of storing data which is to be viewed as hierarchy contexts this note presents an algorithm improves on previous context tree retrieval algorithms it based the observation that in typical uses changes are infrequent relative retrievals so can cached speed up a started position and auxiliary structures built make search rapid algorithms for addition deletion garbage collection outlined cacm september 1976 wegbreit b frame problem variable bindings 3 69 74 4 10 ca760907 jb january 1978 8 49 am 2832 5
