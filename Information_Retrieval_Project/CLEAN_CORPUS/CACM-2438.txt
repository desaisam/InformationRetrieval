a model and stack implementation of multiple environments many control access environment structures require that storage for a procedure activation exist at times when is not nested within the activated this straightforward to implement by dynamic allocation with linked blocks each but rather expensive in both time space paper presents an implementation technique using single stack hold which allows retention durations necessarily tied flow the has property simple case it runs identically usual automatic deallocation applications this multitasking coroutines backtracking label valued variables functional arguments are discussed in initial model real processor assumed assumes multiple processes coordinate passing explicitly one another multiprocessor requires only few changes basic as described cacm october 1973 bobrow d g wegbreit b environments dendrarchy funarg problem systems extensible 4 1 2 22 3 32 5 24 ca731002 jb january 23 1978 8 27 am 1972 2438 2156 2168 2723 2736 2833 2855 3074 3112 1826 2314 2625 2922 3081 3101 106 6 1380 1471 1753 2138 2193 2358 2838 3185 731
