hybrid simulation models of computer systems this paper describes the structure and operation a hybrid simulation model in which both discrete event analytic techniques are combined to produce efficient yet accurate system models in an example based on simple hypothetical computer is used arrival activation jobs central server queueing network use processors the accuracy efficiency technique demonstrated by comparing result computational costs with those equivalent only cacm september 1978 schwetman h performance evaluation 4 32 35 8 1 ca780902 dh february 5 1979 3 pm 2712 3070 2741 3016 3059 3153 1805 2454 2988
