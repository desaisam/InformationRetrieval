computing connected components on parallel computers we present a parallel algorithm which uses n2 processors to find the connected components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time o log2n an bound also can be achieved using only the used transitive closure symmetric boolean matrix assume that have access common memory simultaneous same location is permitted for fetch instructions but not store cacm august 1979 hirschberg d chandra a sarwate graph theory processing algorithms component 5 25 32 6 22 ca790802 db january 4 1980 12 18 pm 3075 3156 2289 2973
