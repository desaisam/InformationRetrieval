computer methods for sampling from the exponential and normal distributions various methods are known transforming uniformly distributed random numbers into exponentially normally quantities the most efficient ones compared in terms of memory requirements speed with some new algorithms a number procedures convert taylor series expansions directly sampling steps an approach which may be used any continuous distribution for exponential a definite recommendation can made whereas case normal there remains choice between slower shorter faster but space consuming cacm october 1972 ahrens j h dieter u pseudorandom simulation numerical analysis 3 29 57 5 11 ca721002 jb january 27 1978 55 pm 1073 4 2276 2137 1153 2565 1716 6
