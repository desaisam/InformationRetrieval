computing standard deviations accuracy four algorithms for the numerical computation of standard deviation unweighted sampled data are analyzed two well known in statistical and computational literature other two new specifically intended automatic our discussion is expository with emphasis on reaching a suitable definition accuracy each four conditions under which it will be accurate we conclude that all provide answers many problems but one old substantially more difficult than cacm september 1979 chan t lewis j mean least squares updating estimates rounding error analysis condition number 5 11 19 ca790907 db january 16 1980 4 23 pm 1619 3166 2731 3159 3167 1411 2799 6
