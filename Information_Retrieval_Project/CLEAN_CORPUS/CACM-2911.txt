anomalous behavior of the fifty percent rule in dynamic memory allocation this paper reports simulation data showing that dynamic memory allocation average free to allocated block ratio can differ considerably and both directions from predictions 50 percent rule a new derivation is given it shown previous derivations make an assumption may be violated frequently on basis hypothesized anomalous behavior results combined effects systematic placement statistics release process additional simulations support this hypothesis systematic which refers natural convention always allocating storage requests against same end selected by strategy tends order blocks within contiguous groups according their time the degree depends on extent are released for non markovian processes correlation between varies approximately inversely with coefficient variation residence distribution show efficiency strongly decreases as s increases some practical implications briefly discussed cacm november 1977 shore j e fragmentation fifty first fit 3 73 4 32 34 35 ca771105 jb december 27 7 37 am 2095 2911 2218 2498 2596 2734 2747 2768 2845 2902 2955 2983 3000 972 273 5 1879 2435 2773
