a heuristic approach to inductive inference in fact retrieval systems procedures are presented which have been developed perform inferences by generalizing from available information the make use of a similarity structure is imposed on the data base using nonnumerical clustering algorithms they implemented model fact retrieval system uses formal query language and property list program experiments described wherein used with test bases altered deleting part purposely introducing false it found that can infer correct response under variety conditions involving incomplete inconsistent cacm december 1974 skinner c w inference inductive heuristics 3 61 71 79 ca741213 jb january 13 1978 40 pm 2178 4 2561 2396 2127 5
