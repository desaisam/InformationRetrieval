extending the information theory approach to converting limited entry decision tables computer programs this paper modifies an earlier algorithm for converting decision tables into flowcharts which minimize subsequent execution time when compiled a computer program the algorithms considered in this perform limited search and accordingly do not necessarily result globally optimal solutions however greater effort needed obtain solution complex is usually justified by sufficient savings there analogy between problem of efficient well understood information theory noiseless coding results literature are used explore limitations solve table two problems also develop improvements extending depth under certain conditions proposing additional be added finally compared with proposed recent verhelst cacm september 1974 shwayder k flowcharting channel sorting 3 50 5 31 ca740910 jb january 17 1978 8 40 am 1354 4 2598 2053 2220 2273 2453 2492 2518 2616 2691 2726 2856 3113 1172 1548 2263 2845 6 1184 1327 2435 2736 2747 2768
