improving programs by the introduction of recursion a new technique program transformation called recursion in troduction is described and applied to two algorithms which solve pattern matching problems by using manipulate a stack are first translated into recursive no operations occur these then subjected second method elimination tabulation produce programs with very efficient running time in particular it shown how fast linear algorithm knuth morris pratt can be derived few steps from simple nonlinear cacm november 1977 bird r s optimization stacks computational induction 4 0 2 5 20 24 25 ca771113 jb december 27 6 29 am 2326 2903 2457 2842 2192
