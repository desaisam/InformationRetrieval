an algorithm for planning collision free paths among polyhedral obstacles this paper describes a collision avoidance algorithm planning safe path polyhedral object moving among known objects the transforms the obstacles so that they represent locus of forbidden positions an arbitrary reference point on a trajectory this which avoids all regions is free collisions trajectories are found by searching network indicates each vertex in transformed other vertices can be reached safely cacm october 1979 lozano perez t wesley m path finding paths graph growing 3 15 64 66 8 1 ca791005 db january 17 1980 10 13 am 3172 4 3116 5
