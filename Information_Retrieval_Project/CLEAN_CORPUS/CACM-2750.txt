a cost oriented algorithm for data set allocation in storage hierarchies set allocation today s multilevel storage systems is usually based on qualitative ad hoc decisions while it would be desirable to obtain an optimal solution this problem clear that the number of parameters involved makes intractable straight forward in such a situation we must find assumptions which simplify greatly but still provide basis considering all significant cost elements this paper presents first quantitative step it considers many detailed costs system utilization data staging and migration although avenues further improvement are available present algorithm seems usefully accurate as can aid quantifying problems configuration new device designs cacm june 1975 lum v y senko m e wang c p ling h hierarchical analysis 3 5 9 6 2 ca750603 jb january 1978 1 31 pm 2750
