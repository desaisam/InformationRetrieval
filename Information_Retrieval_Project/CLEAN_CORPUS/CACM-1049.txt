numerical solution of nonlinear two point boundary problems by finite difference methods nonlinear two point boundary value problems is often an extremely difficult task quite apart from questions reality and uniqueness there no established numerical technique for this problem at present shooting techniques are the easiest method attacking these when fail more finite differences can be used to obtain a solution this paper gives examples discusses difference non linear cacm june 1964 holt j f ca640618 jb march 9 1978 07 pm 1049 4 5 416
