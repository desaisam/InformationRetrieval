an iterative factorization technique for polynomials iterative technique is displayed whereby factors of arbitrary degree can be found polynomials in one variable convergence shown to occur always if a certain jacobian does not vanish and the initial approximation factor near enough an actual the process simply programmed preliminary results indicate it well adapted use with digital computers for two similar that bairstow present method being somewhat simpler cacm march 1963 luther h a ca630326 jb 14 1978 12 51 pm 1111 5 894 6
