significant event simulation this paper compares a new method of simulation organization called the significant event with an old one clock pulse using as examples two automobile traffic models the is found to be more efficient than at low levels system interaction and less high a simple mathematical model for trade off in relative running time methods developed aids choosing between particular experiment it concluded that can value some systems when computational efficiency sufficient importance cacm june 1975 babich f grason j parnas d l 8 1 ca750604 jb january 9 1978 20 pm 2749 5
