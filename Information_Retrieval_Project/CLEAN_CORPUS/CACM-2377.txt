a hardware architecture for implementing protection rings of computations and information is an important aspect a computer utility in system which uses segmentation as memory addressing scheme protection can be achieved in part by associating concentric rings decreasing access privilege with computation this paper describes hardware processor mechanisms implementing these the allow cross ring calls subsequent returns to occur without trapping the supervisor automatic validation references across boundaries also performed thus call user procedure protected subsystem including identical companion passing referencing arguments are same both cases well cacm march 1972 schroeder m d saltzer j h control time sharing shared virtual multics 4 32 6 21 ca720304 jb january 31 1978 2 58 pm 1458 2377 1523 1603 1698 1747 1748 1753 1828 1854 1877 1960 2150 2317 2319 2358 2378 2372 2342 2376 2379 2424 2482 2497 2558 2618 2625 2626 2632 2669 2704 2723 2738 2740 2741 2840 2867 2941 3105 3144 3184 1471 5 1746 1749 2436 2868 2870 953 2080 2380 2629
