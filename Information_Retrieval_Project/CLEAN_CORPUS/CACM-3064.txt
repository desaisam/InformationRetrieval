event manipulation for discrete simulations requiring large numbers of events the event manipulation system presented here consists two major parts first part addresses the familiar problem scheduling efficiency when number scheduled events grows large second deals with less apparent providing and flexibility as are accessed to be executed additional features problems dealt include proper handling simultaneous that certain must created at same points in simulated time infinite loops caused by concatenation such zero possible diagnosed maintaining various counts is practical economical a capability displaceable desirable cacm september 1978 ulrich e simulation discrete systems simulation flow mechanisms 3 65 74 4 22 8 1 ca780908 dh january 29 1979 6 46 pm 2767 3064 2844 2936 3051 3109 1846 5 1939 2742
