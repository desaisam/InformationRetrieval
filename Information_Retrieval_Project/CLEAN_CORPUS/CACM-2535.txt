the effects of multiplexing on a computer communications system a study is made the way in which asynchronous time division multiplexing changes stochastic nature arrival process from user to computer and consequently affects performance shared communications system it concluded that while for certain values parameters there noticeable improvement model sense scheduling delays are reduced these improvements offset by transmission imposed so may be little or no change analytical simulation results based being an m d 1 queue multiplexor tandem with single exponential server include general description output conditions under this approximately poisson cacm march 1973 pack c sharing algorithms operating systems 3 80 81 6 20 ca730304 jb january 24 1978 11 13 am 2535 5
