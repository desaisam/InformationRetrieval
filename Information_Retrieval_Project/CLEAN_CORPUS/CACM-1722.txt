methods of convergence improvement for some improper integrals in the numerical integration an improper integral first kind it is customary to truncate when change yielded by last iteration less than some predetermined constant the efficiency such schemes can often be improved use recent advances in theory nonlinear transformations however several important integrals e g whose integrands are rational polynomials these fail yield much improvement this paper methods convergence developed which greatly improve including cacm july 1968 mcwilliams g v thompson r w approximation truncation 3 15 5 13 16 19 ca680707 jb february 22 1978 11 58 am 1722
