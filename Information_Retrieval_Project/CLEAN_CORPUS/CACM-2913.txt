the aliasing problem in computer generated shaded images certain defects such as jagged edges and disappearing detail have long been an annoyance digitally generated shaded images although increasing the resolution or defocusing display can attenuate them understanding of these leads to more effective methods this paper explains observed terms aliasing phenomenon inherent sampled signals discusses prefiltering a recognized cure a method for evaluating filters is presented application hidden surface algorithms discussed implementation filtering tiler shown accompanied by examples its effectiveness cacm november 1977 crow f c computer graphics convolutional removal sampling 8 2 ca771103 jb december 27 7 56 am 2816 4 2913 2828 2827 3047 2751 5
