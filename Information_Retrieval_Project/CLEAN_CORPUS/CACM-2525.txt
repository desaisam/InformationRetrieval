a statistical study of the accuracy floating point number systems this paper presents statistical results tests accuracy certain arithmetic systems in evaluating sums products and inner analytic error estimates for some computations the studied are 6 digit hexadecimal 22 binary floating point number representations combined with usual chop round modes various numbers guard digits a modified mode in sense differing only their use or shown to be approximately statistically equivalent inaccuracy further is superior all cases save one found cacm april 1973 kuki h cody w j analysis rounding representation 5 11 32 ca730403 jb january 24 1978 10 04 am 2525 4 1474
