on the criteria to be used in decomposing systems into modules this paper discusses modularization as a mechanism for improving flexibility ad comprehensibility of system while allowing shortening its development time the effectiveness is dependent upon criteria used dividing modules a design problem presented and both conventional unconventional decomposition are described it shown that decompositions have distinct advantages goals outlined arriving at discussed if implemented with assumption module consists one or more subroutines will be less efficient most cases an alternative approach to implementation which does not this effect sketched cacm december 1972 parnas d l software modularity engineering kwic index 4 0 ca721208 jb january 27 1978 11 09 am 2247 5 2480 2738 2867 3004 3030 3155 1425 6 1749 2080 2204 2356 2379 2456 2457 2651 2777 2958 2972 3073 3186 799
