methods of evaluating polynomial approximations in function evaluation routines the method nested multiplication is commonly used function evaluation routines to evaluate approximation polynomials new polynomial methods have been developed recent years which require fewer multiplications than and may therefore be preferable for use although some these do not appear practically useful because rounding error difficulties several evaluating low degree found satisfactory three such are described illustrated cacm march 1967 file c t ca670309 jb february 28 1978 1 08 pm 1620 4 819 5 436
