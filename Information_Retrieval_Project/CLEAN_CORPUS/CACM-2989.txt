empirical evaluation of some features instruction set processor architectures this paper presents methods for empirical evaluation features processors isps isp are evaluated in terms the time used or saved by having not feature the based on analysis traces program executions concept a register life is troduced and to answer questions like how many registers simultaneously would be sufficient all most what overhead if number were reduced during their lives also discusses problem detecting desirable but non existing instructions other problems briefly discussed experimental results presented obtained analyzing 41 programs running dec system 10 cacm march 1977 lunde a computer architecture behavior instruction sets op code utilization structures simultaneous tracing execution 6 20 21 33 ca770303 jb december 30 1 00 am 1653 4 2989 2411 2709 2889 2937 3005 3025 3101 1069 5 2138
