an optimal method for deletion in one sided height balanced trees a one sided height balanced tree is a binary which every node s right subtree has equal to or exactly greater than the of its left it an advantage over more general avl that only bit balancing information required two bits are acl shown deletion arbitrary such can be accomplished o logn operations where n number nodes moreover method optimal sense complexity cannot reduced order magnitude this result coupled with earlier results by hirschberg indicates three basic problems insertion and retrieval adversely affected this modification cacm june 1978 zweben s mcdonald m search trees 3 73 74 4 34 5 25 31 ca780601 dh february 26 1979 12 48 pm 2839 3096 3009 3042 3065 3163 2889 6
