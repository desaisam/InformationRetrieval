automatic data structure selection an example and overview the use of several levels abstraction has proved to be very helpful in constructing maintaining programs when are designed with abstract data types such as sets lists programmer time can saved by automating the process filling low level implementation details in past programming systems have provided only a single general purpose for an type thus produced using were then inefficient space or this paper system automatically choosing efficient implementations from library is discussed this detail example program general issues structure selection also reviewed cacm may 1978 low j abstract automatic structures optimizing compilers 4 12 22 6 ca780504 dh february 26 1979 1 51 pm 1957 3103 2151 3148 1860 5 2877
