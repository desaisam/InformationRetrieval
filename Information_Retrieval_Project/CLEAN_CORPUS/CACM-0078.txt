remarks on the practical solution of characteristic value problems this paper is concerned with practical solution characteristic value problem for an ordinary differential equation it at once apparent that sequential computers be they digital or analog solve initial problems rather than boundary and some mathematical process must found to compensate machine s inadequacy compensating imperfection course normal activity numerical analyst a number other papers have applied particular devices the purpose this note establish a framework model these procedures thus assist in use extension ideas cacm june 1959 wouk ca590606 jb march 22 1978 6 30 pm 78 5
