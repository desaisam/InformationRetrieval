scalar and planar valued curve fitting using splines under tension the spline under tension was introduced by schweikert in an attempt to imitate cubic splines but avoid the spurious critical points they induce defining equations are presented here together with efficient method for determining necessary parameters computing resultant standard scalar valued curve fitting problem is discussed as well of open closed curves plane use these importance contour lines mentioned application cacm april 1974 cline a k interpolation contouring 5 13 8 2 ca740414 jb january 18 1978 9 23 am 2656 4 2655 6
