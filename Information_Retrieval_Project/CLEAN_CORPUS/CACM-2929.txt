an analysis of inline substitution for a structured programming language optimization technique known as inline substitution is analyzed the consists replacing procedure invocation by modified copy the body general problem using to minimize execution time subject size constrain ts formulated and an approximate algorithmic solution proposed algorithm depends on run statistics about program be optimized preliminary results clu structured programming language indicate that in programs with low degree recursion over 90 percent all calls can eliminated little increase compiled code small savings other conclusions based these are also presented cacm september 1977 scheifler r w open coding compilation compilers languages 4 12 ca770905 jb december 27 1 23 pm 1086 2929 1132 1234 1263 1265 1270 1323 1358 1379 1380 1453 1464 1484 1491 1498 1613 1614 1781 1825 1860 2083 2178 2179 2252 2325 2341 2546 2645 2652 2684 2842 2934 3069 669 679 691 761 949 989 5 3184
