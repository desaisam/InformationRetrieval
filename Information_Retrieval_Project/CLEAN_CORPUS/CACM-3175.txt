breaking substitution ciphers using a relaxation algorithm ciphers are codes in which each letter of the alphabet has one fixed substitute and word divisions do not change in this paper problem breaking substitution is represented as probabilistic labeling every code assigned probabilities representing plain text letters these updated parallel for all using joint iterating updating scheme results improved estimates that finally lead to cipher the method applies successfully two examples cacm november 1979 peleg s rosenfeld a cryptography classification relaxation 3 42 63 ca791103 db january 23 1980 11 15 am 3175 5
