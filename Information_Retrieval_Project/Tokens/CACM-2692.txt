reentrant polygon clipping a new family of clipping algorithms is described these are able to clip polygons against irregular convex plane faced volumes in three dimensions removing the parts polygon which lie outside volume in two permit windows polygons be clipped represented as an ordered sequence vertices without repetition first and last marked contrast representation a collection edges was heretofore common procedure output have identical format with introduced describe any newly cut edge or the easily handle particularly difficult problem detecting that vertex may required at corner window achieve considerable simplicity by separately each boundary code capable single reentered subsequent boundaries each such reentrant stage need store only values begin its processing soon output from proceeding ready because same code for very complex shapes practical for perspective applications dimentions six truncated pyramid chosen additional planes parallel projection screen serve limit range depth preserved through method provides arbitrary view angles field spite simple fixed this ideal hidden surface computations cacm january 1974 sutherland i e hodgman g w computer graphics 5 31 6 32 35 ca740107 jb 18 1978 2 04 pm 2004 4 2692 2687 1915
