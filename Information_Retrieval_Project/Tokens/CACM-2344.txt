on the optimization of performance time sharing systems by simulation a simulation model a time sharing system with finite noncontiguous store and an infinite auxiliary is used to study variation parameters such as size number jobs allowed execute simultaneously job scheduling algorithm etc the effects these variations on measure performance ascertain which controllable including itself require optimization not normally have marked effect system based upon mean cost delay all processed it shown that significant improvements in can be obtained using variable slice techniques selecting optimum round robin cycle appears features would benefit from whereas other affect predictable manner features under control also particular supervisor overheads speed cpu comparison made between results two analytical equations for quantum oriented nonpreemptive systems found very favorable cacm june 1972 blatny j clark s r rourke t studies algorithms 3 80 4 30 32 ca720601 jb january 31 1978 9 19 am 2219 2344 1938 5
