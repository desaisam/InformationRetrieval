multidimensional binary search trees used for associative searching this paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree or k d where is dimensionality of space as a data structure storage information to be retrieved by associative searches the defined and examples are given it shown quite in its requirements a significant advantage this that single can handle many types queries very efficiently various utility algorithms developed their proven average running times an n record file insertion o log deletion root 1 random node optimization guarantees logarithmic performance partial match with t keys specified maximum time nearest neighbor empirically observed these performances far surpass best currently known these tasks an algorithm presented any general intersection query main focus theoretical felt however trees could useful applications potential uses cacm september 1975 bently j l retrieval key attribute system 3 63 70 74 4 49 ca750902 jb january 6 1978 22 pm 2722 5
