impact of computers on the undergraduate mathematics curriculum the use computers to permit widespread application mathematical ideas requiring computation in science and technology is extremely significant for understanding our current society student interest this development intense if properly utilized should yield a much better concepts as well programming logical structure which have been introduced into many fields by present paper suggests that portion undergraduate curriculum preparation mathematics persons who are not professional mathematicians be modified include extensions clarifications possible because an early introduction desirable continuing automatic illustrate clarify following calculus equation stage an intensive numerical analysis added in addition providing competence mostly used computing techniques it would more sophisticated utilization advanced associated with complex variables transform theories cacm september 1966 murray f j ca660905 jb march 2 1978 6 31 pm 1381 5
