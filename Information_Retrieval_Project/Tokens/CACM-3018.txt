covering edges by cliques with regard to keyword conflicts and intersection graphs kellerman has presented a method for determining keyword conflicts described heuristic algorithm which solves certain combinatorial optimization problem in connection this this is here shown be equivalent the of covering edges graph complete subgraphs objective minimizing number a relationship between edge clique cover coloring established allows algorithms either one these problems constructed from other as consequences conflict are np if p then they do not admit polynomial time approximation always produce solutions within factor less than 2 optimum cacm february 1978 kou l stockmeyer wong c watson t intersection graphs node computational complexity heuristics 4 12 5 25 32 ca780205 jb march 28 18 pm 3018
