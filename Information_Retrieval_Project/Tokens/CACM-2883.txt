an application of heuristic search methods to edge and contour detection this paper presents a method for detecting edges contours in noisy pictures the properties an edge are embedded figure merit the detection problem becomes minimizing given can be represented as shortest path on graph solved using well known search algorithms relations between this representation minimization dynamic programming approach discussed showing that lead substantial improvements computing time moreover if heuristic methods used will depend amount noise picture some experimental results these show how various information about shape contour object thus allowing extraction from separation touching objects cacm february 1976 martelli a processing pattern recognition following optimization problems solving 3 63 64 66 5 42 ca760204 jb january 1978 9 30 am 2883 4 2195
