efficient implementation of a variable projection algorithm for nonlinear least squares problems least squares frequently arise which the variables to be solved can separated into linear and nonlinear part a variable projection algorithm has been developed recently is designed take advantage structure problem whose separate in this way this paper gives slightly more efficient general version than appeared earlier cacm march 1974 krogh f t parameter estimation 5 14 15 ca740313 jb january 18 1978 10 49 am 2670
