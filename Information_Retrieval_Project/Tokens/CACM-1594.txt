an algorithm for generating permutations algorithm is described which under repeated application generates all permutations of k elements only the previously generated permutation constant and a temporary index are needed starting with particular ordering abcd will generate 1 additional by successive rotations from initial circular objects another can be obtained rotating lowest for each new 2 by continuing in this manner applications orderings or since yields cacm may 1967 langdon jr g ca670508 jb february 28 197810 35 am 1594 5 2087 2189 3188 6 3191 521 612
