an o n algorithm for determining a near optimal computation order of matrix chain products this paper discusses the computation matrix chain products form m1 x m2 mn where mi s are matrices the order in which computed affects number operations a sufficient condition about association optimal is presented algorithm to find an takes less than 25 percent longer time topt also in most cases yields or only few 1 on average cacm july 1978 chin f approximate heuristic multiplication product 5 14 ca780703 dh february 8 1979 2 46 pm 3075 4 3085 2557
