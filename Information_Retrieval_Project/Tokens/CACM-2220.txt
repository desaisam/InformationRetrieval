conversion of limited entry decision tables to computer programs a proposed modification pollack s algorithm has proposed an algorithm for converting decision tables into flowcharts which minimize subsequent execution time when compiled a computer program two modifications this are the first relies on shannon noiseless coding theorem and the communications concept entropy but does not completely test else rule second modification tests results in more executions than both result guarantees globally optimal solution cacm february 1971 shwayder k table information theory channel sorting 3 50 5 31 ca710201 jb 8 1978 10 06 am 1237 4 2220 1354 1488 1548 1684 1994 2053 2273 2453 2492 2518 2598 2616 2726 2856 3113 753 1172 1327 250 1489 6 2221 2263 2691
