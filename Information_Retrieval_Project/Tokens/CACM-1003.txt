a computer analysis method for thermal diffusion in biochemical systems in the thermal detection of rapid biochemical reactions it is necessary to correct temperature data for transient heat conduction losses a cylindrical calorimeter to handle complexities arising from varying relaxation times concentric insulating layers computer program was developed which gives distribution system as function radius and time this corrected at each step by subroutine calculates instantaneous chemical state there action well produced this reaction the based on direct statement fourier s law rate equation provide bookkeeping follow reactants flow packets such way that continually stores analysis method here regarded one physical laws process are used explicitly usually results passing much mathematical procedures conventionally tested against some known exact solutions gave identical compared with experimental construction programs principle general applicability has been applied several other phenomena cacm september 1964 davids n berger r l ca640908 jb march 9 1978 5 13 pm 1003
