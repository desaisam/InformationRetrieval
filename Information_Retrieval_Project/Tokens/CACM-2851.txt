formal verification of parallel programs two formal models for parallel computation are presented an abstract conceptual model and a program the former does not distinguish between control data states latter includes the capability representation infinite set by allowing there to be arbitrarily many instruction pointers or processes executing an induction principle is which treats state sets on same ground through use place variables it observed that certain correctness conditions can expressed without enumeration all possible examples in used demonstrate proofs mutual exclusion it shown assertions oriented proof methods special cases a case method called incomplete formalization deadlock then concept norm introduced yields extension problem floyd s technique proving termination also discussed allows each process have its own local permits shared global correctness forms implementation also appendix included relates this work previous satisfiability logical formulas cacm july 1976 keller r m verification petrinet 4 6 5 2 9 8 1 ca760702 jb january 1978 20 pm 2228 2851 2280 2379 2320 2482 2597 2740 2777 2895 2912 2920 2946 3128 1877 2150
