on computing the fast fourier transform cooley and tukey have proposed a fast algorithm for computing complex transform shown major time savings in using it to compute large transforms on digital computer with n power of two this is proportional log2 improvement over other methods with 2 in paper the briefly reviewed difference equation accurately needed trigonometric function values are given problem system virtual memory considered solution this method has been used size 16 15 words core storage exceeds by factor eight maximum radix fixed allocation amount also mixed a scaling plan point arithmetic cacm october 1967 singleton r c ca671008 jb february 27 1978 03 pm 1525 5 1668 1669 1679 1728 2859 6 1647 1676 1785
