a new approach to automatic scanning of contour maps the problem automatic digitizing contour maps is discussed structure a general map analyzed and its topological properties are utilized in developing new scanning algorithm detection recognition lines solved by two color labeling method it shown that for containing normal only it suffices distinguish between so called even odd tangency involved practical solution based on minimizing computer memory space simplifying control program suggested cacm september 1972 mor m lamdan t topology 3 14 19 6 35 36 ca720903 jb january 27 1978 4 46 pm 2287 2547 3062 1925 5
