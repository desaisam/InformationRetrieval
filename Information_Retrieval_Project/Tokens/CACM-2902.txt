dynamic memory allocation in computer simulation this paper investigates the performance of 35 dynamic memory allocation algorithms when used to service simulation programs as represented by 18 test cases algorithm was measured terms processing time usage and external fragmentation algorithms main taining separate free space lists for each size block tended perform quite well compared with other simple operating on ordered without any list performed surprisingly employing power two sizes had favorable requirements but generally unfavorable lifo fifo or poorly others cacm november 1977 nielsen n r algorithm management storage garbage collection programming techniques 3 74 4 49 5 25 8 1 ca771114 jb december 27 6 09 am 1211 2902 1389 1549 1552 1906 2095 2162 2218 2435 2498 2596 2704 2734 2747 2768 2773 2845 2911 2955 2983 3000 1051 1062 1184 1879
