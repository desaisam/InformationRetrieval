an efficient data structure for the simulation event set recently algorithms have been presented realization of event scheduling routines suitable general purpose discrete simulation systems several exhibited a performance superior to that commonly used simple linked list in this paper new algorithm is which improves on two aspects best previously published first s quite insensitive skewed distributions and second its worst case complexity o n where number events in set furthermore tests conducted estimate average showed it be nearly independent cacm august 1977 franta w r maly k time flow mechanisms scanning multilinked lists 3 34 4 22 5 8 1 ca770807 jb december 28 7 15 am 2844 2936 3051 3064 3109 2742 2767 1846 6 1939
