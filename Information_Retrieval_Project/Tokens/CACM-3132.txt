experiments with some algorithms that find central solutions for pattern classification in two class pattern recognition it is a standard technique to have an algorithm finding hyperplanes which separates the classes in linearly separable training set the traditional methods find hyperplane all points other but such not necessarily centered empty space between since central does favor one or should lower error rate classifying new and therefore better than noncentral six algorithms are tested on three data sets although frequently used practice modified relaxation very poor three defined paper found be quite good cacm march 1979 slagle j classification linear discriminants centering centrality criteria dead zone accelerated 3 62 63 ca790303 dh april 12 20 pm 3132 4 2215 5
