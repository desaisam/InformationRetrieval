a case study in programming for parallel processors an affirmative partial answer is provided to the question of whether it possible program parallel processor computing systems efficiently decrease execution time useful problems are multiprocessor which several processors can simultaneously execute separate tasks a single job thus cooperating solution computational problem the have independent instruction counters meaning that each executes its own task relatively independently other communication between by means data storage shared all determination distribution current an electrical network was written system and this simulated gathered from simulation runs demonstrate efficient typical large class important it shown with proper programming when n applied approaches 1 times while improper actually lead increase number stability method also investigated cacm december 1969 rosenfeld j l parallelism multiprogramming tasking interference relaxation jacobi gauss seidel convergence 3 24 4 9 5 14 17 6 21 ca691201 jb february 15 1978 45 pm 1811
