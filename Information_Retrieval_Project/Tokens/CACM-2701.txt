a fast and usually linear algorithm for global flow analysis abstract only complete paper jacm 23 1 january 1976 new algorithm global flow analysis on reducible graphs is presented the shown to treat a very general class of function spaces for graph e edges the has worst case time bound o log operations it also that in programming terms number proportional plus exits from program loops consequently restriction one entry exit control structures linearity can be extended yet larger classes by relaxing examples are given code improvement problems which solved using cacm december 1975 graham s l wegman m data optimization common subexpression elimination live dead information propagation reducibility go less depth first search path compression 4 12 5 24 25 32 ca751206 jb 1978 08 pm 2701
