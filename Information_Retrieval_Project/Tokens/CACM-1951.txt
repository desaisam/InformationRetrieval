estimates of distributions random variables for certain computer communications traffic models a study multiaccess computer communications has characterized the distributions underlying an elementary model user interactive process the used is in sense that many random variables generally are interest studies can be decomposed into elements this data were examined from four operational systems and shown to robust each same distribution independent which being it gamma describe discrete approximations by exponential discussed studied cacm december 1970 fuchs e jackson p time sharing operating optimization models 3 80 81 6 20 ca701212 jb february 9 1978 2 46 pm 1533 4 1951 1604 2373 2667 2668 1410 5 2894 1751 1810 2016 2374
