a fast algorithm for copying list structures an algorithm is presented copying an arbitrarily linked list structure into a block of contiguous storage locations without destroying the original apart from fixed number program variables no auxiliary such as stack used the needs mark bits and operates in linear time it shown to be significantly faster than fisher s fastest previous same problem its speed comes mainly its efficient traversal technique which folds processing being built classification cells nine types enables operations optimized each type cacm may 1978 clark d lisp space complexity constant workspace 4 34 49 5 25 ca780501 dh february 26 1979 3 pm 1024 3106 1051 1102 1132 1390 1486 1549 1706 1826 1869 1878 378 2060 2155 2156 2168 2361 2513 2665 2719 2723 2736 2766 2838 2842 2855 2879 2944 2954 3074 3077 3080 3112 627 106 210 1972 2998
