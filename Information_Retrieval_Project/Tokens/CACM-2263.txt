the conversion of limited entry decision tables to optimal and near flowcharts two new algorithms new algorithms for deriving optimal near flowcharts from limited entry decision tables are presented both take into account rule frequencies the time needed test conditions one called optimum finding algorithm leads a flowchart which truly minimizes execution table in simple rules already contracted complex other one approaching requires many fewer calculations but does not necessarily produce first derived treating containing an else is shown be equally valid including such compared with existing ones applied somewhat large real case from this comparison two conclusions drawn 1 will usually lead better results than comparable require more less computation 2 in general greater effort applying justified by small reduction obtained cacm november 1972 verhelst m flowcharting preprocessor programs search 3 50 59 4 19 29 49 5 31 ca721106 jb january 27 1978 10 pm 2263 2598 2691 2726 3113 1172 6 1327 1354 1488 1489 1548 2220 2221 2453 2856
