experiments in automatic learning for a multipurpose heuristic program an automatic learning capability has been developed and implemented use with the multiple multipurpose that learns heuristic tree searching program which is presently being applied to resolution theorem proving predicate calculus s pp uses two evaluation functions guide its search proof of whether or not particular goal achievable thirteen general features clauses were created better a multiple regression was used produce optimal coefficients linear polynomial terms also data handling routines written passing between analyzing summarizing results data generally collected analysis from experience number experiments performed test effectiveness generality results showed produced dramatic improvements solutions problems same domain as those collection also shown generalize successfully domains other than another experiment demonstrated could simultaneously improve performance on specific variety some variations tested cacm february 1971 slagle j r farrell c d providing self modifying artificial intelligence problem solving adaptive lisp 3 62 64 ca710204 jb 8 1978 9 33 am 2217 5
