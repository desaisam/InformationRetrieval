automatic segmentation of cyclic program structures based on connectivity and processor timing time shared multiprogrammed overlayed batch systems frequently require segmentation computer programs into discrete portions these program are transferred between executable peripheral storage whenever necessary s in a manner that reduces the frequency such transfers is subject this paper techniques proposed by c v ramamoorthy to limitations arise when preferred segment size not compatible with physical restrictions imposed available computing equipment a generalization suggestions made order allow their application circumstances other than ideal cacm january 1970 lowe t automatic cyclic structures loops paging multiprogramming loaders assemblers compilers time sharing connectivity 4 19 5 24 32 ca700101 jb february 14 1978 2 20 pm 2130 1916 2582 1751 6 1924 2017
