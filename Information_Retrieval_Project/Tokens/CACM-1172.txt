conversion of limited entry decision tables to computer programs tables are useful for describing a set complex decision rules based on given sets conditions algorithms that can efficiently convert the into computer programs will extend usefulness users two such algorithms work done by m s montalbano described and extended here handle dashes else the first algorithm minimizes storage space required resultant program second running time during conversion process both pinpoint any contradictions or redundancies among in table cacm november 1965 pollack l ca651109 jb march 6 1978 4 56 pm 1172 5 1354 2053 2220 2273 2453 2598 2726 2856 1237 1327 1488 1489 1548 1684 250 2221 2263 2691 753
