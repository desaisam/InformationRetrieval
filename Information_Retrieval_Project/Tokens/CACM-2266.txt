a highly parallel algorithm for approximating all zeros of a polynomial with only real an algorithm is described based on newton s method which simultaneously approximates all zeros polynomial only real the conceptually suitable parallel computation determines its own starting values so that convergence to the guaranteed multiple and their multiplicity are readily determined at no point in deflation used cacm november 1972 patrick m l numerical algorithms polynomials 5 15 ca721103 jb january 27 1978 2 35 pm 2266 2660 6
