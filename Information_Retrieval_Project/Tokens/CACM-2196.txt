a man machine approach toward solving the traveling salesman problem the traveling salesman problem belongs to an important class of scheduling and routing problems it is also a subproblem in solving others such as warehouse distribution has been attacked by many mathematical methods with but meager success only for special forms or moderate number points can it be solved exactly even if very large amounts computer time are used heuristic procedures have proposed tested only slightly better results this paper describes aided heuristic technique which uses modest amount real solve 100 200 point takes advantage both s human abilities not asked brute force way today heuristics organize data so that easily this seems new directions field man machine interaction artificial intelligence cacm may 1971 krolak p felts w marble g assignment mask rubber band tour generator process 3 57 66 5 30 ca710503 jb february 1978 00 pm 2196
