an optimal insertion algorithm for one sided height balanced binary search trees algorithm inserting an element into a one sided height balanced oshb binary search tree is presented the operates in time o log n where the number of nodes this represents improvement over best previous ly known insertion algorithms hirschberg and kosaraju which require 2n moreover complexity optimal earlier results have shown that deletion such structure can also be performed thus result this paper gives negative answer to question whether trees should first examples their kind has smaller than furthermore it now concluded retrieval same as corresponding operations more general avl within constant factor however appear much complicated cacm september 1979 raiha k zweben s 3 73 74 4 34 5 25 31 ca790904 db january 14 1980 11 47 am 2839 3163 3009 3042 3065 3096 2889
