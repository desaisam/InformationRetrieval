storage reorganization techniques for matrix computation in a paging environment in order to multiply matrices while minimizing the number of page fetches required it is often more efficient reorganize data into submatrix form and use block multiplication rather than best known algorithms which leave stored row or column oriented an method accomplishing this reorganization given this also makes possible derivation an asymptotically better bound by adapting technique strassen reorganized the scheme shown be advantageous pages realistic size adaptation not former even if transpose one available at no additional cost cacm july 1979 fischer p probert r paging virtual memory pagination 4 34 5 14 25 ca790703 dh august 22 2 29 pm 2365 3152 2362 2582 1924
