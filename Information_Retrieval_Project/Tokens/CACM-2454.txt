computational algorithms for closed queueing networks with exponential servers methods are presented computing the equilibrium distribution of customers in closed queueing networks exponential servers expressions various marginal distributions also derived the computational algorithms based on two dimensional iterative techniques which highly efficient and quite simple to implement implementation considerations such as storage allocation strategies order evaluation examined some detail cacm september 1973 buzen j p theory steady state 5 12 8 1 3 ca730901 jb january 23 1978 10 07 am 2454 2712 2741 3070 1526 6 1749 1805 2988
