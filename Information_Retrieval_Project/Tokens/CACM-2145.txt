automation of etching pattern layout help heuristic program is an application program developed to computerize the tedious and error prone although vitally important wiring design printed circuit boards helps automate a stage one step closer production than logical it can be used patterns two layer on which ics in dual line packages as well discrete components such transistors resistors have been placed employs methods one heuristic method simulates human approaches other theoretically interesting but time consuming maze running based lee s algorithm performs more 90 percent required by path with respect performance function for each point connection bring number successful connections very close 100 cacm november 1971 aramaki i kawabata t kazuhiko a etching pattern layout board 3 24 66 4 9 6 ca711104 jb february 2 1978 10 58 am 2145 5
