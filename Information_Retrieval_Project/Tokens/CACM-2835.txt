recursion analysis for compiler optimization a relatively simple method the detection of recursive use procedures is presented in compiler optimization implementation considerations are discussed and a modification algorithm given to further improve this analysis can also be used determine what possible subset values could assumed by variables which only take on small discrete set the most common parameters assuming label procedure or pascal s enumerated type cacm september 1976 walter k g recursion 4 12 ca760904 jb january 1978 9 36 am 2835 5
