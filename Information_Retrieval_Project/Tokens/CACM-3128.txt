synchronization with eventcounts and sequencers of concurrent processes requires controlling the relative ordering events in a new synchronization mechanism is proposed using abstract objects called eventcounts sequencers that allows to control directly rather than mutual exclusion protect manipulations shared variables direct seems simplify correctness arguments also simplifies implementation distributed systems the defined formally then several examples its use are given relationship protection mechanisms system explained particular shown be applicable situations where confinement information matters an eventcount s a memory described cacm february 1979 reed d kanodia r process interprocess communication security models semaphores 4 30 32 ca790207 dh april 12 10 03 am 2320 3128 2597 2700 2777 2840 2851 2865 2866 2869 2895 2898 2912 2938 2945 2946 2972 3043 3144 3148 3158 2150 5 2376 2436 2870 3082
