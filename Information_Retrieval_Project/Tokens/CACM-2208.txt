storage utilization in a memory hierarchy when assignment is performed by hashing algorithm the utilization of storage is studied two level memory hierarchy first which the fast store divided into number areas an entry to be filed hashing algorithm will attempt place one these if this particular area full then placed slower second even though other may have space available given n entries been entire expression derived for expected storehis gives measure how effectively being used by means examples as function and total size cacm march 1971 williams j g algorithms allocation 3 74 4 ca710304 jb february 1978 37 pm 2208 5
