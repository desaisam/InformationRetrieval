git a heuristic program for testing pairs of directed line graphs isomorphism given a pair directed line graphs the problem ascertaining whether or not they are isomorphic is one which no efficient algorithmic solution known since straightforward enumerative algorithm might require 40 years running time on very high speed computer in order to compare two 15 node more sophisticated approach seems called the situation similar that prevailing areas such as game playing and theorem proving where practical algorithms unknown interesting cases but various though only partially successful techniques available git graph tester incorporates variety processes attempt narrow down search an isomorphism demonstrate none exists no scheme relied upon exclusively program designed avoid excessive computation along fruitless lines has been written comit language successfully tested ibm 7090 cacm january 1964 unger s h ca640110 jb march 10 1978 5 24 am 1145 4 1504 3040 655 6
