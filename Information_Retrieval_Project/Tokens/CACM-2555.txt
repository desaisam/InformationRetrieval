variable precision exponentiation a previous paper presented an efficient algorithm called the recomputation algorithm for evaluating a rational expression to within any desired tolerance on computer which performs variable precision arithmetic operations the can be applied expressions involving having o 10 p sum ei error bounds where denotes operation s and in ith argument this presents exponential with bound of above order other such as log sin cos have simple series expansions handled similarly cacm january 1973 richman p l function analysis interval 5 11 ca730106 jb 24 1978 4 32 pm 2555 2605 2286
