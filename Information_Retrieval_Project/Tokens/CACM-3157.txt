proving termination with multiset orderings a common tool for proving the termination of programs is well founded set a ordered in such way as to admit no infinite descending sequences the basic approach find function that maps values program variables into some value repeatedly reduced throughout computation all too often functions required are difficult and complexity out proportion under consideration multisets bags over given s sets multiple occurrences elements taken from ordering on induces an finite multisets this multiset shown be enables use relatively simple intuitive otherwise proofs in particular used prove production systems defined terms rewriting rules cacm august 1979 dershowitz n manna z program correctness verification orderings term tree replacement reduction 5 24 7 ca790803 db january 4 1980 3 44 pm 3157 3014
