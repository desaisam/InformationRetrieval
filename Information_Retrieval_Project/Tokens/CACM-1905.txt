the simplex method of linear programming using lu decomposition standard computer implementations dantzig s simplex method for linear programming are based upon forming the inverse basic matrix and updating after every step these have bad round off error properties this paper gives theoretical background an implementation which is decomposition computed with row interchanges slow but has good behavior appears as cacm algorithm 350 may 1969 bartels r h goulub g errors computational stability 5 41 ca690504 jb february 17 1978 3 49 pm 1905 4 1744
