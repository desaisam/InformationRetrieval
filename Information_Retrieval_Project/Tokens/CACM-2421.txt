a scan conversion algorithm with reduced storage requirements most graphics systems using a raster scan output device crt or hardcopy maintain display file in the xy random format converters hardware software must be provided to translate picture description from published conversion algorithms which are fast will reserve buffer area large enough accommodate entire screen on other hand those use small slow because they require multiple passes through the algorithm described here uses linked list data structure process lines of drawing strips corresponding groups relatively primary memory is used accumulate binary image for group when this portion has been plotted reused next because processing procedures only single pass required when generating and slight increase execution time over fully buffered core results results that storage requirements can reduced by more than 80 percent while causing less 10 cacm november 1973 jordan b w jr barrett r c plotter line discrete dot generation 4 41 6 35 8 2 ca731105 jb january 20 1978 28 am 1891 2421 2211 2674 2687 1741 5 2004
