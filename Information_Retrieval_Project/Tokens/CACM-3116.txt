interference detection among solids and surfaces in many industrial environments it is necessary to determine whether r there interference among components there are potential problems in products made up of assemblies product manufacturing testing typically drawings used an attempt detect such unwanted interferences but the two dimensional static drafting medium does not always show three moving parts this paper presents a computer representation for solids surfaces algorithms which carry out checking objects so represented objects as polyhedra or piecewise planar two types discussed detection intersections fixed positions collisions along specified trajectories cacm january 1979 boyse j intersection collision solid polyhedral graphics polygons 3 2 8 ca790101 dh april 10 50 am 2827 4 3116 2771 5 3172 6
