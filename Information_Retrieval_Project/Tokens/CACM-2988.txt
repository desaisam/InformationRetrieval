memory management and response time this paper presents a computationally tractable methodology for including accurately the effects of finite memory size workload requirements in queueing network models computer systems empirical analyses analytic studies based on applying this to an actual multiaccess teractive system are reported relations between variables such as requirement distribution job swap time performance measures response utilization graphically displayed a multiphase analytically soluble model is proposed being broadly applicable analysis which use nonpaged memories cacm march 1977 brown r m browne j c chandy k management 4 32 ca770304 jb december 30 12 51 am 2988 1750 5 3059 3070 1805 6 2454 2741
