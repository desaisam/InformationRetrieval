a bounded storage algorithm for copying cyclic structures new algorithm is presented which copies cyclic list structures using bounded workspace and linear time unlike a previous similar this one makes no assumptions about the storage allocation system in use uses only operations likely to be available high level language the distinctive feature of technique traversing structure twice same spanning tree each case first from left right then cacm june 1977 robson j m copying shared subtrees 4 49 5 25 ca770609 jb december 28 12 56 pm 2766 2954 2855 3106 2665 1549 6 210 1972 2998
