trace driven modeling and analysis of cpu scheduling in multiprogramming system microscopic level job stream data obtained a production environment by an event driven software probe is used to drive model multiprogramming computer system the scheduling algorithm the systematically varied this technique called trace modeling provides accurate replica for testing variations at same time alterations methods can be easily carried out controlled way with cause effects relationships being isolated tested included best possible worst traditional theory round robin first come served etc dynamic predictors relative absolute performances these are given it concluded that successful method must preemptive prevent from holding too long period cacm december 1972 sherman s baskett iii f browne j c performance measurement models 4 10 20 31 32 ca721210 jb january 27 1978 57 am 2245 5 2571 3072 3119 1713 6 2219 2375 2798 2849 2859
