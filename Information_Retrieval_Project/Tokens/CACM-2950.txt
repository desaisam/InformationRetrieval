a unifying approach to scheduling this paper presents a scheme for classifying scheduling algorithms based on an abstract model of system which formalizes the notion priority various classes are defined and related existing criterion implementation efficiency algorithm is developed results in definition time invariant include most commonly implemented ones for dependence processing rates priorities derived the provides framework implementing flexible schedulers real operating systems policy driven scheduler bernstein sharp discussed as example such cacm july 1977 ruschitzka m fabry r s models processor sharing 4 31 32 34 35 8 1 ca770702 jb december 28 12 pm 2950 3072 2219 5
