a linear sieve algorithm for finding prime numbers new algorithm is presented finding all primes between 2 and n the executes in time proportional to assuming that multiplication of integers not larger than can be performed unit method has the same arithmetic complexity as by mairson 6 however our version perhaps simpler more elegant it also easily extended find prime factorization cacm december 1978 gries d misra j primes algorithms data structures 5 25 24 29 ca781202 dh january 22 1979 11 12 am 2896 4 3037 2972 3039 3043 3073 2732 2927
