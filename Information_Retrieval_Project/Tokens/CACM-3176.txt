storing a sparse table the problem of storing and searching large sparse tables is ubiquitous in computer science standard technique for such hashing but has poor worst case performance we propose good method static table n entries each an integer between 0 n 1 requires w words storage allows o logn access time although our little complicated to use practice analysis shows why simpler algorithm used compressing lr parsing works so well cacm november 1979 tarjan r yao a gaussian elimination matrix compression lookup 3 74 4 12 34 5 25 ca791104 db january 23 1980 11 24 am 3041 3176 3126 2905
