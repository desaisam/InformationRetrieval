a parser generating system for constructing compressed compilers this paper describes a parser generating system pgs currently in use on the cdc 6500 computer at purdue university the is fortran coded compiler in input translation grammar each bnf syntactic rule corresponds to possibly empty code generator realizable as an assembly language or algol subroutine that called whenever applied parse of program typical one pass compilers constructed by translate source programs speeds approaching 14 000 cards per minute for xpl and its tables occupy 288 words 60 bit core memory which 140 are parsing table entries 82 links generators cacm november 1973 mickunas m d schneider v b translator writing systems analysis normal form grammars pushdown automata optimization compression algorithm 4 12 5 22 23 ca731103 jb january 20 197810 41 am 2179 2423 1337 2015 2733 1781 6 2786 799
