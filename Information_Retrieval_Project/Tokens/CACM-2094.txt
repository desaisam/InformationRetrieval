on an algorithm for nonlinear minimax approximation certain nonlinear minimax approximation problems are characterize d by properties which permit the application of special algorithms mainly based on exchange remes 1934 1935 their solution in this paper to type a general algorithm due osborne and watson 1969 is considered examples given illustrate that can give satisfactory results in particular successfully solve lead difficulties with more conventional specialist method cacm march 1970 g a linear programming 5 13 41 ca700304 jb february 1978 4 52 pm 1932 2094 1566 2352 2353 6
