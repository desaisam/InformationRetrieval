some complete calculi for matrices a matrix calculus is introduced with the intention of developing data structures suitable a high level algorithmic language mathematical programming the paper investigates how special structure matrices can be described and utilized efficient computing by saving memory space superfluous operations sequences sequences are considered operators areext ended to sequence cumulative algorithms given which use symbol manipulation expressions so as find forms best suited computation these called normal several completeness results obtained in sense that each expression an equivalent form found within specified cacm april 1970 bayer r witzgall c complete linear concatenation languages 4 12 22 5 14 41 ca700403 jb february 13 1978 3 18 pm 2081 2253 2254 6 437
