analyses of deterministic parsing algorithms this paper describes an approach for determining the minimum maximum and average times to parse sentences acceptable by a deterministic parser these quantities are presented in form symbolic formulas called time the variables these represent not only length input string but also perform elementary operations such as pushing popping subscripting iterating etc by binding actual numerical values corresponding given compiler machine configuration one can determine execution that time derived examining grammar rules program representing algorithm wishes analyze is described using specific defines simple arithmetic expressions two parsers analyzed top down recursive descent ll 1 bottom up slr provides estimates relative efficiencies two applicable pdp 10 substantiated buy benchmarks finally illustrates proposed applying it analyses programming language cacm june 1978 cohen j roth m syntactic analysis algorithms parsing 4 12 5 23 24 25 7 ca780603 dh february 26 1979 32 pm 1350 3094 1399 1659 1768 1781 1945 2110 2719 2733 2986 3093 1265 2179 2645
