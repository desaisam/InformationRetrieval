efficient multiprogramming resource allocation and accounting although sometimes thought of as only a component time sharing operation multiprogramming can involve broader questions resource allocation since fairness is not required to meet response criterion in multiprogrammed system it may serve maximal use be unfair for example by holding an input output channel idle program while completes small amount processor usage enabling further the several applications this principle are given suggested that executive might dynamically adjust its algorithms gain efficiency resources closely connected accounting those raising problems repeatability minimal uncharged overhead relative weighting charges dependent since weightings depend on these arbitrary parameters often repeatable one which omits extensive will paid should prove efficient overcharges result turns memory essential control other the general suggestions applied question some details provided case monitor controls virtual machine cacm june 1973 hamlet r g 4 32 ca730601 jb january 23 1978 3 51 pm 1892 2499 1901 2085 2095 2218 2277 2319 2329 2358 2373 2380 2434 2501 2582 2669 2828 2863 2881 2928 2996 3006 3067 1751 5 3114 1502 6 2745
