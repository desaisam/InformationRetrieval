the list set generator a construct for evaluating expressions list set generator is defined and algorithms its use are given a construct which may be added to processing system or any that handles sets it efficiently generates the results from expression involving operators efficiency derives evaluating as whole in parallel rather than subexpressions then using those arrive at final result cacm december 1970 shapiro s c manipulating generation lists file 3 73 74 4 22 ca701206 jb february 9 1978 23 pm 1024 1957 1051 1098 1214 1380 1388 1393 1485 1487 1549 1570 1860 1878 1946 2155 2151 2162 2168 2723 2857 3103 3112 3148 1389 5 731
