a fast method for solving a class of tridiagonal linear systems the solution linear systems having real symmetric diagonally dominant tridiagonal coefficient matrices with constant diagonals is considered it proved that the lu decomposition converges when floating point precision also computed arithmetic used and limits using are roughly within machine this fact exploited to reduce number operations required solve system from 8n 7 5n 2k 3 where k much less than n order matrix if elements subdiagonals superdiagonals 1 then only 4n needed entire takes words storage considerable savings in array subscripting achieved upper lower bounds on obtained terms ratio diagonal constants parameters various generalizations these results discussed cacm january 1974 malcolm m palmer j numerical algebra toeplitz 5 11 14 17 ca740102 jb 18 1978 2 50 pm 2697
