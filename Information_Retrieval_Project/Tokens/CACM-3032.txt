reverse path forwarding of broadcast packets a broadcast packet is for delivery to all nodes a network algorithms accomplishing this through store and forward switching computer include 1 transmission separately addressed packets 2 multidestination addressing 3 hot potato forwarding 4 spanning tree 5 source based to list algorithms we add 6 reverse path routing method which exploits procedures data structures already available practical algorithm in networks the described as being because it not optimal according metrics developed its analysis paper also can be implemented existing with less complexity than that required the known alternatives cacm december 1978 dalal y metcalfe r protocols 81 32 ca781207 dh january 18 1979 10 pm 3032 3119 2849
