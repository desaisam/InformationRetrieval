an efficient incremental automatic garbage collector this paper describes a new way of solving the storage reclamation problem for system such as lisp that allocates automatically from heap and does not require programmer to give any indication particular items are no longer useful or accessible a reference count scheme reclaiming non self referential structures linearizing compacting copying reorganize all at users discretion proposed the algorithms designed work well in systems which use multiple levels large virtual address space they depend on fact most cells referenced exactly once counts need only be accurate when is about reclaimed transaction file stores changes table more than cacm september 1976 deutsch l p bobrow d g management garbage collection 4 19 ca760906 jb january 1978 8 58 am 1708 2833 1781 1826 1860 1972 2156 2168 2249 2314 2438 2719 2723 2736 2845 2855 3074 3112 1626 5 2944 106 6 1380 1549 210 2513 2766 2838 2998 731
