generation of rosary permutations expressed in hamiltonian circuits systematic generation a specific class permutations fundamental to scheduling problems is described in nonoriented complete graph with n vertices hamitonian circuits equivalent 5 1 elements termed rosary can be defined each them corresponds two circular which mirror image each other and generated successively by number system covering 3 4 sets edges every set e k determined recursively constructing circuit from starting the the basic operation consists transposition pair adjacent where position permutation two algorithms treating same example for five are presented it very easy derive all possible cycling taking reverse order procedures performed fairly efficiently computer cacm june 1971 harada k theory combinatorial algebra 32 39 ca710601 jb february 1978 55 pm 2044 2189 2087 2417 2505 2874 2908 3188 1594 2292 521 3191 6
