a process for the determination of addresses in variable length addressing an algorithm is presented assignment instruction addresses and formats under following conditions 1 length varies as a function distance from its target 2 there exists an optimality criterion which implies some preferential choices subject to addressing constraints this may be example achieving smallest number long instructions case total code minimized or minimizing assigned address specified point program the suitable arbitrary structure choice optimization criteria cacm june 1976 frieder g saal h j variable assembler paging 4 11 12 ca760604 jb january 1978 09 pm 2858 3110 2194 5 6 2629
