certification of programs for secure information flow this paper presents a certification mechanism verifying the secure flow information through program because it exploits properties lattice structure among security classes procedure is sufficiently simple that can easily be included in analysis phase most existing compilers appropriate semantics are presented and proved correct an important application confinement problem the prove cannot cause supposedly nonconfidential results to depend on confidential input data cacm july 1977 denning d e p j protection 4 3 35 5 24 ca770707 jb december 28 8 48 am 1807 2945 2034 2290 2579 2923 3128 3150 1947 2704 2870
