reduction of compilation costs through language contraction programming languages tailored to particular groups users can often be constructed by removing unwanted features from a general purpose language this paper describes the use simulation techniques predict savings in compilation cost achievable such an approach the results suggest function which effect changes power on algorithm expressed that when not actually used are removed compiling decreases moderately but needed increases sharply cacm may 1974 shaw m design programming contraction compiler algol 4 12 20 ca740501 jb january 17 1978 39 pm 1086 2652 1132 1234 1263 1265 1270 1323 1358 1379 1380 1453 1464 1484 1491 1498 1613 1614 1781 1825 1860 2083 2178 2179 2252 2325 2341 2546 2645 2684 2842 2929 2934 3069 669 679 691 761 949 989 5 3184
