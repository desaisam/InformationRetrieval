some new methods of detecting step edges in digital pictures this note describes two operators that respond to step edges but not ramps the first is similar the digital laplacian uses max rather than sum x and y second differences difference between mean median gray levels a neighborhood outputs obtained from these applied set test pictures are compared with each other standard gradient a third operator which distance center centroid as an edge value also briefly considered it turns out be equivalent one approximations cacm february 1978 schachter b rosenfeld image processing pattern recognition detection 3 63 ca780210 jb march 28 1 56 pm 3013 5
