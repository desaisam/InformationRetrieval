fast parallel sorting algorithms a parallel bucket sort algorithm is presented that requires time o log n and the use of processors the makes a technique more space than product realistic model used in which no memory contention permitted procedure also to numbers k using 1 for an arbitrary integer computation this permits simultaneous fetches from same location cacm august 1978 hirschberg d processing sorting algorithms 3 74 4 34 5 25 31 ca780803 dh february 7 1979 10 am 2714 3075 3085 3156 2289 2557 2664 6 2973
