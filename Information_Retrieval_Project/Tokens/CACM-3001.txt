detection of combined occurrences in this paper it is supposed that the variables x1 xn each have finite range with variable xi taking on pi possible values and are changing time it further desired to detect occurrences in which some subset achieve particular finally problem involves detection a large number combined for changes two efficient solutions described both methods unusual property being faster systems where sum p1 pn larger the first solution error free suitable most cases second slightly more elegant allows negation as well conjunction but subject possibility errors an analysis given method an empirical study reported cacm january 1977 zobrist a l carlson f r jr coding hash retrieval secondary keys pattern recognition artificial telligence demons n tuples sorting chess 3 63 5 31 ca770104jb 1978 12 15 am 2532 4 3001 2631 2746 2033 2139
