a case study of a new code generation technique for compilers recent developments in optimizing techniques have allowed new design compilers to emerge such compiler translates the parsed source code into lower level by sequence steps each step expands higher statements blocks and then performs optimizations on result statement has only one possible expansion task tailoring this take advantage any special cases is done this paper provides evidence that strategy can indeed good object the traditionally difficult pl i concatenate was investigated as detailed example set fairly simple identified which allow produce more elaborate further improve for most contexts produced using optimization described above compares favorably with conventional cacm december 1977 carter j l structure generation concatenation program data flow analysis 4 12 13 22 ca771203 jb february 1 1980 3 54 am 2897 5
