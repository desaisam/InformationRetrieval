assembling code for machines with span dependent instructions many modern computers contain instructions whose lengths depend on the distance from a given instance of such an instruction to operand that this paper considers problem minimizing programs machines an efficient solution is presented case in which every span dependent either label or assembly time expression certain restricted formf this restriction relaxed by allowing these operands be more general expressions then shown np complete cacm april 1978 szymanski t variable length addressing code generation assemblers compilers computational complexity 4 11 12 5 25 ca780406 dh february 26 1979 3 49 pm 2626 3110 2786 2840 2858 2919 3017 3174 2194 2629
