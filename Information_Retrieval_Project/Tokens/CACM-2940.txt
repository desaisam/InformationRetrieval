abstraction and verification in alphard defining specifying iteration generators the form provides the programmer with a great deal of control over implementation abstract data types in this paper abstraction techniques are extended from simple representation function definition to iteration statement most important poin t interaction between structure language itself a means specializing s loops operate on entities without explicit dependence those is troduced specification verification that allow properties generators for such iterations be expressed proof rules developed results obtained common special cases these essentially identical corresponding constructs other languages showing generator will terminate also provided cacm august 1977 shaw m wulf w assertions specialization correctness invariants statements modular decomposition program specifications programming methodology proofs 4 20 5 24 ca770803 jb december 28 7 59 am 2940 3150 2060 6 2704 2842 2939 2941 2943 3073 3148
