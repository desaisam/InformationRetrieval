the synthesis of loop predicates current methods for mechanical program verification require a complete predicate specification on each loop because this is tedious and error prone producing with correct predicates reasonably difficult would be facilitated by machine assistance this paper discusses techniques mechanically synthesizing two classes are considered 1 heuristic which derive from boundary conditions or partially specified inductive assertions 2 extraction use input appropriate weak interpretations to obtain certain an evaluation the interpretation cacm march 1974 wegbreit b synthesis well founded sets property theorem proving 3 64 4 19 22 5 24 ca740206 jb january 18 1978 12 55 pm 2683 2874 3104 1682 6 2227 2317 2457 2871 521
