implementing clenshaw curtis quadrature ii computing the cosine transformation in a companion paper to this i methodology and experiences automatic quadrature scheme was described how each formula used in requires cosine transformation of integrand values shown the high cost these transformations has been serious drawback using two other problems related have also trouble some first conventional computation by recurrence relation is numerically unstable particularly at low frequencies which largest effect upon integral second case should require refinement sampling storage required save after computed this second part shows can be modification fast fourier transform all three overcome applicable circumstances requiring or sine such as polynomial interpolation through chebyshev points cacm may 1972 gentleman w m series 5 13 14 16 ca720506 jb january 31 1978 9 56 am 2355 4 2354 2350 2640 1418 1521 1597 1679 6 1883 2040
