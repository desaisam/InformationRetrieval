a procedure for inverting large symmetric matrices in the least squares method simultaneous adjustment of several parameters coefficients normal equations are elements a symmetric positive definite matrix order to solve and evaluate precision measures resulting inversion this is required many available procedures do not take advantage symmetry thus when programmed high speed computer all n 2 must be stored manipulated whereas only 1 them independent allow given memory capacity handle larger following procedure inverting has been devised cacm august 1962 busing w r levy h s ca620833 jb march 17 1978 9 09 pm 495 5
