an exponential method of numerical integration ordinary differential equations a formula for numerical integration is prepared which involves an exponential term this compared to two standard methods and it shown that a large class differential equations the has superior stability properties step sizes thus this may be used with size decrease total computing time solution significantly particularly in those engineering problems where high accuracy not needed cacm august 1963 pope d ca630843 jb march 13 1978 7 52 pm 2567 5 755 2268 6
