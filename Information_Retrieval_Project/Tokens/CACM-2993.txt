occurrences of cycling and other phenomena arising in a class linear programming models an investigation into the average queue size for certain class queues has resulted formulation linear programming problems which are ill conditioned some cases in attempting to solve these models using ibm s mps package instances cycling were encountered small perturbations input data did not cycle this fact plus several other observed phenomena suggest that primary reason is known occur more frequently round off errors computations perturb problem sufficiently prevent or at least indefinite one case maximizing minimizing an objective function subject same constrain t set was attempted but solved only while giving indication infeasibility cacm february 1977 kotiah t c steinberg d i queueing 5 41 9 ca770208 jb december 30 2 11 am 2993
