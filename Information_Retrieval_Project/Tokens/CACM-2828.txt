hierarchical geometric models for visible surface algorithms the geometric structure inherent in the definition of shapes three dimensional objects and environments is used not just to define their relative motion placement but also assist solving many other problems systems producing pictures by computer by using an extension traditional information or a hierarchy five significant improvements current techniques are possible first range complexity environment greatly increased while visible any given scene kept within fixed upper limit second meaningful way provided vary amount detail presented third clipping becomes very fast logarithmic search resolvable parts field view fourth frame coherence graphical working set fraction total that should be present primary store immediate access surface algorithm finally suggests recursive descent which computation time potentially grows linearly with cacm october 1976 clark j h algorithms hidden hierarchical data structures models 5 31 8 2 ca761003 jb january 3 1978 4 42 pm 1892 2828 1901 2085 2095 2218 2277 2319 2329 2358 2373 2380 2434 2499 2501 2582 2669 2674 2687 2816 2827 2863 2881 2913 2928 2996 3006 3047 3067 1751 2004 2751 2841
