the simulation of time sharing systems development new large scale time systems has raised a number problems for computation center management not only is it necessary to develop an appropriate hardware configuration these but software adjustments must be made unfortunately often do not respond changes in the manner that intuition would suggest and there are few guides assist analysis performance characteristics comprehensive simulation model investigation questions described this paper resulting general purpose design can used study variety it also algorithms or techniques for sake efficiency greater applicability was implemented limited fortran subset compatible with most iv compilers use demonstrated by ibm 360 67 system cacm july 1967 nielsen n r ca670701 jb february 28 1978 9 15 am 1572 5 1805 1846 1892 2188 2218 2317 1198 6 1380 1424 1484 1518 1526 1693 1728 1748 1749 1751 1753 1752 1781 1810 1879 2095 2126 2148 576
