information theory applied to the conversion of decision tables computer programs using ideas from information theory this paper develops a heuristic algorithm that converts limited entry decision table tree structured computer program with near minimum average processing time the method is applicable any and does not require actions have single rules or cost testing conditions be equal it thus more general than previously published algorithms compared optimal reinwald soland easy code takes much smaller translation it felt useful in practice well suited for manual conversion tables flowcharts cacm september 1973 ganapathy s rajaraman v optimum programs measure 3 50 4 12 5 6 ca730902 jb january 23 1978 10 01 am 1237 2453 1354 1549 1564 1684 2053 2220 2221 2273 2517 2598 2726 2856 3034 3113 1172 753 1327 1548 2263 2691
