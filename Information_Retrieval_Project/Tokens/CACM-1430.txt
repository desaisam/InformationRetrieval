multiple precision floating point conversion from decimal to binary and vice versa binary decimal floating point conversion is often performed by using a table of the powers 10 i ia positive integer for converting base 2 coefficient polynomial approximation x 0 1 these tables occupy large storage region in case nonsingle precision this paper shows that single small suffices vice versa any useful cacm may 1966 mancino o g ca660507 jb march 3 1978 9 56 am 1430 5
