digital simulation of discrete flow systems the discrete flow systems discussed are characterized by the movement randomly arriving items along interacting channels programing a digital computer to simulate such utilizes some techniques not common in other approaches physical problems principal portion paper is discussion two simulation studies that illustrate programming involved one an extensive package handling plant with objective being optimization parameters as storage capacities and processing rates in air traffic control procedures simulated compare effects alternative decisions cacm december 1960 moore c j lewis t s ca601212 jb march 20 1978 6 27 pm 104 5
