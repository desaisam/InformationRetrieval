improved event scanning mechanisms for discrete simulation models of large complex real world applications have occasionally earned the reputation eating up hours computer time this problem may be attributed in part to difficulties such as slow stochastic convergence however an additional lies fact that a significant amount bookkeeping is required keep future events their proper sequence paper presents method significantly reducing spent scanning event lists discrete simulations there are presented all which improve effectiveness list scan becomes more burdensome cacm june 1975 wyman f p simulation mechanisms 4 34 5 8 1 ca750611 jb january 9 1978 12 43 pm 2742 2844 2936 3064 970 6 1059 1846 1939 2767
