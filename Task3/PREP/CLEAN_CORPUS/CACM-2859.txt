interference in multiprocessor computer systems with interleaved memory this paper analyzes the memory interference caused by several processors simultaneously using modules exect results are computed for a simple model of such system the limiting value is derived relative degree as size increases behavior yields approximate and also suggests that valid much larger class models including those more nearly like real systems tested against some measurements program simulations references from programs provide good indication performance should be expected this type cacm june 1976 baskett f smith a j multiprocessing interleaved trace driven simulation 4 32 6 21 34 8 1 ca760603 jb january 1978 2 19 pm 1668 2859 1669 1679 1728 1525 5 1676 2918 3119 2245 2798 2849
