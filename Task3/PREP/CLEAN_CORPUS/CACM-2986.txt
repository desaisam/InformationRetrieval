operations on sparse relations various computations relations boolean matrices or directed graphs such as the computation of precedence for a context free grammar can be done by practical algorithm that is asymptotically faster than those in common use for example how to compute operator wirth weber o n 2 steps shown well linear functions where size grammer the heart algorithms general theorem giving sufficient conditions under which an expression whose operands are sparse and operators composition transitive closure union inverse computed efficiently cacm march 1977 hunt h b iii szymanski t g ullman j d computational complexity relation matrix graph function slr canonical 4 12 5 23 25 ca770306 jb december 29 8 05 am 1542 2986 1683 1693 1781 1787 1836 1945 2060 2061 2082 2091 2152 2179 2221 2340 2356 2546 2603 2698 2708 2733 2824 2982 3045 3093 3094 1491
