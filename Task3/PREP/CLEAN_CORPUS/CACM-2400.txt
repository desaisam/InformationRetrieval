use of the hough transformation todetect lines and curves in pictures has proposed an interesting computationally efficient procedure for detecting lines pictures this paper points out that use angle radius rather than slope intercept parameters simplifies computation further it also shows how method can be used more general curve fitting gives alternative interpretations explain source its efficiency cacm january 1972 duda r o hart p e picture processing pattern recognition line detection colinear point transformation 3 63 ca720103 jb february 1 1978 9 36 am 2400 5 2788 2910 6
