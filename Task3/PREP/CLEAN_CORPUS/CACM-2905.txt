perfect hashing functions a single probe retrieving method for static sets refinement of hashing which allows retrieval an item in a static table with single probe is considered given set i identifiers two methods are presented building mechanical way perfect functions i e transforming the elements into unique addresses the first method quotient reduction shown to be complete sense that every smallest can stored and from they retrieved by using function constructed this found however nonuniformly distributed sets give rather sparse tables second remainder not above but it seems minimal or almost kind techniques applicable directly small some extend these results larger also rough comparison ordinary given shows used conveniently several practical applications cacm november 1977 sprugnoli r hash coding direct addressing identifier address transformations scatter storage 3 7 74 4 34 ca771111 jb december 27 6 45 am 2905 5 3041 3126 3176 829 2846
