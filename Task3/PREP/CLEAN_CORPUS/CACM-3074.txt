a time and space efficient garbage compaction algorithm given an area of storage containing scattered marked nodes differing sizes one may wish to rearrange them into a compact mass at end the while revising all pointers show their new locations an algorithm is described here which accomplishes this task in linear time relative size space order bit for each pointer the operates by reversibly encoding situation that collection point single location list emanating from pointed passing through pointing terminating with s transplanted contents cacm august 1978 morris f compaction ification reclamation allocation record structures relocation processing free data 4 34 49 5 32 ca780804 dh february 7 1979 10 16 am 1972 3074 2156 2168 2249 2361 2438 2513 2723 2736 2833 2838 2855 2896 3039 3106 3112 1826 1853
