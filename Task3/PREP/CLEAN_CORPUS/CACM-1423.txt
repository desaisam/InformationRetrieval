a simple algorithm for computing the generalized inverse of a matrix the generalized inverse matrix is important in analysis because it provides an extension concept which applies to all matrices it also has many applications numerical but not widely used existing algorithms are fairly complicated and require considerable storage space simple been found conventional orthogonalization method inverting non singular gives with little extra effort no additional requirements algorithm any m by n including special case when rank in first ordinary second yields least squares transformation inv advantage avoiding loss significance results forming product explicitly cacm may 1966 rust r burrus w schneeberger c ca660514 jb march 3 1978 9 22 am 1423 5
