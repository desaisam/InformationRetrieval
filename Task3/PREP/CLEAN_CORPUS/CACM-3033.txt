optimizing decision trees through heuristically guided search optimal decision table conversion has been tackled in the literature using two approaches dynamic programming and branch bound the former technique is quite effective but its time space requirements are independent of how easy given furthermore it cannot be used to produce good quasi optimal solutions uses a heuristic direct search cluttered up by an enormous since number increases with test variables according double exponential in this paper we suggest heuristically guided top down algorithm which like recognizes identical subproblems can find both method introduced combines positive aspects above techniques compressed tables large handled without deriving expanded first cacm december 1978 martelli a montanari u tree and or graphs 3 59 66 5 42 8 ca781206 dh january 18 1979 56 pm 3033 4 3113 2856
