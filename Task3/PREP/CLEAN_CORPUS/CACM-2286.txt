automatic error analysis for determining precision the problem considered is that of evaluating a rational expression to within any desired tolerance on computer which performs variable precision floating point arithmetic operations an automatic error analysis technique given determining directly from the results trial low interval calculation just how much and data accuracy are required achieve final generalize easily evaluation many nonrational expressions cacm september 1972 richman p l control 5 11 ca720904 jb january 27 1978 4 39 pm 2286 2555 2605 1026 6
