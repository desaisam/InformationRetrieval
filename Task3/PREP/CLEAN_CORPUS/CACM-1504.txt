algorithms for finding a fundamental set of cycles an undirected linear graph given the adjacency matrix graph algorithm presented in this paper finds spanning tree and then constructs set fundamental cycles our is slower than by welch ratio n 3 number nodes but requires less storage for graphs with large edges when limited our superior to s however are small or machine very timing estimates requirements both methods cacm december 1967 gotlieb c corneil d g ca671204 jb february 26 19782 35 pm 1504 4 3040 1145 5 1847 1961 2052 1008 6 1013 1369 1540
