copying cyclic list structures in linear time using bounded workspace a bounded workspace copying algorithm for arbitrary list structures is given this operates linear time and does not require tag bits the best previous algorithms achieved n 2 without log with one only restriction on the here that copy must be placed into a contiguous section of memory method applicable to fixed or variable size nodes cacm may 1975 fisher d processing space complexity 4 49 5 25 ca750501 jb january 9 1978 3 22 pm 2766 2954 3106 2665 2855 1549 6 1826 210 1972 2513 2833 2998
