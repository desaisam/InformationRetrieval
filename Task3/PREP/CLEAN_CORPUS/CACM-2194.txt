how to keep the addresses short an algorithm is presented for minimizing sum of lengths blocks coding produced by an assembler or compiler when 1 length each computer instruction assumed to be either long short if memory location addressed more than a predetermined distance from current otherwise and 2 there are instructions whose beginnings origins separated prespecified amounts for example some computers permit 8 bit addressing interpreted relative counter full 16 all when assembling compiling two which have many mutual references in such no simple iterative procedure keeping as addresses possible this paper demonstrates that wide class problems this type can formulated covering solvable means elementary arithmetic operations on column vectors ternary matrix cacm may 1971 richards d l problem integer programming variable 4 11 12 21 5 41 ca710505 jb february 3 1978 40 pm 2194 2858 3110 6 2629
