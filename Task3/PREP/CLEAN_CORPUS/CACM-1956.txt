optimum merging from mass storage an algorithm is displayed which yields the merge orders such that total read time defined to be sum of seek plus data transfer minimized for a sort using mass storage the analysis parameterized in terms ratio it takes fill available core with records and file size units lengths thus can applied any conventional cpu combination explicit formula derived parameters correlates very well calculated optimum yielded by involves roots simple transcendental equation a short table these included numerical results are graphically wide range it found normalized merging on given hardware configuration proportional length times logarithm cacm december 1970 black n sorting timing drum access 3 37 4 49 5 31 ca701207 jb february 9 1978 18 pm 1956 2017 854
