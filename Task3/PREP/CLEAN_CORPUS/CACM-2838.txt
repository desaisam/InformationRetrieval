analysis of an algorithm for real time garbage collection a real time garbage collection system avoids suspending the operations a list processor long times that normally requires by performing on second in parallel with processing or single shared them algorithms recovering discarded structures this manner are presented and analyzed to determine sufficient conditions under which never needs wait collector these techniques shown require at most twice as much power regular collectors if they used efficiently the average behavior program is be very nearly equal worst case performance so also suitable measuring typical algorithm cacm september 1976 wadler p l storage reclamation lisp sharing multiprocessing data analysis algorithms 3 69 89 4 19 29 32 34 9 5 25 ca760901 jb january 1978 57 am 1024 2838 1051 1102 1132 1390 1486 1549 1706 1826 1878 378 2060 2155 2168 2719 2723 2842 2855 2879 2896 3039 3074 3077 3080 3106 3112 627 106 210 6 1380 1972 2438 2736 2833 731
