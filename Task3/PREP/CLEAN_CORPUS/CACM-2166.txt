automated algebraic manipulation in celestial mechanics in this paper we consider some of the applications automated algebraic manipulation which have been made celestial mechanics particular attention is paid to use poisson series and a typical problem perturbation theory described the requirements processors for are considered compared with those general packages some future directions research using these systems briefly outlined to illustrate relative simplicity algorithm required integration an appendix cacm august 1971 jefferys w h algebra 5 10 13 17 ca710806 jb february 2 1978 3 31 pm 2166 2170 2165 6 2167
