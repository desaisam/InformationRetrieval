a note on computing approximations to the exponential function two methods are discussed which result in near minimax rational approximations exponential function and at same time retain desirable property that approximation for negative values of argument is reciprocal corresponding positive these lead much superior commonly used convergents gaussian continued fraction coefficients errors given intervals 5 ln 2 cacm january 1967 cody w j ralston ca670110jb february 28 1978 4 25 pm 1015 1645 1346 1440 951 532
