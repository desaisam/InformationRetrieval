digital synthesis of correlated stationary noise in this note we propose a method generating stationary noise with prescribed auto covariance function by digital methods the need for such technique often arises in testing the performance data processing and engineering systems where inputs corrupted correlated known form are required is quite simple produces strict sense which agrees approximately r t acf over an interval t 0 consists approximating spectral density periodic process lines then synthesizing random phases appropriate amplitudes order to simplify discussion statistical properties generated first presented terms exact harmonic analysis practice discrete as third section used cacm july 1962 peabody p adorno d s ca620728 jb march 17 1978 7 59 pm 533 5
