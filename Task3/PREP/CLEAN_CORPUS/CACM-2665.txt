copying list structures using bounded workspace two new algorithms are presented for list structure copying using bounded workspace the first of primarily theoretical interest shows that without cell tag bits the task can be performed in time n 2 second algorithm assuming one bit each delivers attractive practical speed any noncyclic is copied linear while cyclic structures average less than nlogn no foreknowledge cycle absence necessary to achieve a variation solves an open problem concerning marking that result demonstrates done aid supplemental or stacks cacm april 1974 lindstrom g processing space complexity 4 34 5 25 ca740405 jb january 18 1978 9 55 am 1869 2665 2513 2723 2855 3106 1383 1549 2766 2954 6 210 1972 2998
