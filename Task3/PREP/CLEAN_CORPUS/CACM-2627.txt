scheduling independent tasks to reduce mean finishing time sequencing minimize mean finishing time or in system is not only desirable the user but it also tends at each point storage required hold incomplete tasks in this paper a deterministic model of independent introduced and new results are derived which extend generalize algorithms known for minimizing addition presenting analyzing shown that most general problem polynomial complete hence unlikely admit non enumerative solution cacm july 1974 bruno j coffman e g jr sethi r flow sequencing optimal scheduling models 4 32 5 39 ca740704 jb january 17 1978 12 56 pm 2627
