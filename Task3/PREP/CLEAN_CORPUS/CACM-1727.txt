one way of estimating frequencies jumps in a program for the segmentation program it is useful to have reasonable estimation values s ij where mean value number jumps from i th instruction on j run time in cases are estimated directly structure whole must be generally taken into account therefore very difficult for programmer and or translator obtain good it easier estimate not but quantities p c sum 1 n an arbitrary positive constant each although proportional because we only probabilities events executed after i this can often done without considering first part paper using theory markov chains algorithm computation found some ways obtaining estimates given second variant this derived avoiding necessity involving large matrices cacm july 1968 kral j object reduction supervisor calls decreasing jump frequencies control transfers optimal chain correspondence graph one entry subgraph locally overhead problem 4 11 19 39 49 ca680702 jb february 22 1978 3 05 pm 1727 5
