an efficient list moving algorithm using constant workspace efficient algorithm is presented for moving arbitrary list structures using no storage apart from program variables other than that required to hold the original and copy the destroyed as it moved no mark bits are necessary but pointers must be distinguishable superior in execution speed previous algorithms same problem some variations extensions of discussed cacm june 1976 clark d w copying lisp space complexity constant workspace 4 34 49 5 25 ca760607 jb january 1978 1 43 pm 1024 2855 1051 1102 1132 1390 1486 1549 1706 1826 1869 1878 1972 378 2060 2155 2156 2168 2361 2438 2513 2665 2719 2723 2736 2833 2838 2842 2879 2944 2954 3074 3077 3080 3106 3112 627 106 210 2766 2998 6
