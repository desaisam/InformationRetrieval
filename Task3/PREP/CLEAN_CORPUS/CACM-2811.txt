structural pattern recognition of carotid pulse waves using a general waveform parsing system general waveform parsing system with application to structural pattern recognition of carotid pulse waves is described the arterial wave medical importance because variation in its structure induced by aging and cardiovascular disease syntax driven analysis has been applied good results these detect measure variations modeled on a compiler allows the user enter specific information as data it thus enough be applicable other waveforms cacm december 1976 stockman g kanal l kyle m c 3 12 34 63 4 ca761204 jb january 1978 1 43 pm 2811 5
