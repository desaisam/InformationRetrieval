two level control structure for nondeterministic programming the basic ideas of nondeterministic programming are critically reconsidered to single out a proper attitude and style language allowing direct control features proposed aims at retaining the purity formulation search processes on one level attempt deferring coordination problem solving efforts another choice feasibility recognizing these two levels is discussed stressing that structure be managed free contexts leaves computational environments each holding an alternative under inspection while other nodes associated with poin ts according generative function t which expresses desired strategy main advantage this approach localization strategies each nonterminal node tree keeps track state computation as it was when last interrogated same time coordinate available alternatives examples given in term nd lisp extension designed implemented according guidelines cacm october 1977 montangero c pacini g turini f artificial telligence structures backtracking planning context 3 64 4 22 ca771004 jb december 27 11 30 am 2625 2922 3081 3101 3112 2438 5
