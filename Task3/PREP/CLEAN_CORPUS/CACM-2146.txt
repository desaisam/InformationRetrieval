optimizing the polyphase sort various dispersion algorithms for polyphase sorting procedure are examinedhe optimum algorithm based on minimizing total number of unit strings read is displayed the logic this rather complicated hence several other new with more straightforward presented of simple discussed horizontal best it does approximately one fourth to and half percent less reading writing than most in use today an additional two three improvement can be achieved by utilizing modified optimum algorithm this relatively but it requires a fairly close estimate before begins cacm november 1971 shell d l repetition operator 5 31 ca711103 jb february 2 1978 11 39 am 1117 4 2146 2017 479 677 860 861 862 863 299
