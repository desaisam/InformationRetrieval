tridiagonalization by permutations tridiagonalizing a matrix similarity transformations is an important computational tool in numerical linear algebra consider the class of sparse matrices which can be tridiagonalized using only row and corresponding column permutations the advantages such transformation include absence round off errors improved computation time when compared with standard a graph theoretic algorithm examines arbitrary n x determines whether or not it permuted into tridiagonal form given requires no arithmetic while number comparisons assignments increments are this compares very favorably methods if permutable gives explicit otherwise early rejection will occur cacm january 1974 gibbs n e poole w g jr permutation eigenvalues bandwidth 5 14 32 ca740104 jb 18 1978 2 31 pm 2695
