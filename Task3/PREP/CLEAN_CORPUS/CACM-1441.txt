methods of numerical integration applied to a system having trivial function evaluations a study has been made determine which methods numerical integration require the least computation time for given amount truncation error when applied particular system ordinary differential equations where function evaluations are relatively trivial recent due butcher and gear compared with classic runge kutta nystrom adams some newer one step found be slightly superior but no method is have any great advantage over others in application this problem cacm april 1966 waters j ca660408 jb march 3 1978 10 37 am 1441 5
