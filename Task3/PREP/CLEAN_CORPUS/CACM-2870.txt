a lattice model of secure information flow this paper investigates mechanisms that guarantee secure information flow in a computer system these are examined within mathematical framework suitable for formulating the requirements among security classes the central component model is lattice structure derived from and justified by semantics properties permit concise formulations different existing systems facilitate construction enforce provides unifying view all restrict enables classification them according to objectives suggests some new approaches it also leads automatic program certification verifying through cacm may 1976 denning d e protection class 4 35 ca760501 jb january 1978 10 pm 2436 2870 2626 2868 2876 3105 3144 953 5 2377 2632 2945 3128 1947 6 2150 2376 2597 2704 2865 2866 2912 3082
