design of tree structures for efficient querying a standard information retrieval operation is to determine which records in a data collection satisfy given query expressed terms values the process locating the desired responses can be represented by tree search model this paper poses an optimization problem design such trees serve well specified application academic sense that ordinarily optimal cannot implemented means practical techniques on other hand it potentially useful comparison affords between observed performance and intuitively attractive ideal procedure as this considers novel scheme based on bit vector representation shows essentially same algorithm used either or an experimental study small formatted file illustrates concepts cacm september 1973 casey r g storage clustering structure management answering 3 62 74 ca730904 jb january 23 1978 9 38 am 1050 4 2451 1234 1935 1936 2017 2032 2257 2360 2452 2556 2765 2978 944 5 2965 849 6 1976 2046 616
