optimal shift strategy for a block transfer ccd memory for the purposes of this paper block transfer memory is composed serial shift registers whose rate can vary but which have definite minimum refresh and maximum the bits iin are numbered 0 to n 1 blocks always transferred starting at bit what best strategy so that request occurring random time will wait minimal amount before be reached requirement does not allow one simply park optimal involves shifting as slowly possible until passed then quickly critical boundary shortly comes around again this called hurry up well known outside computer field also viewed paging drum with variable bounded rotation speed cacm may 1978 sites r paging charge coupled devices register hierarchy electronic latency 3 72 5 39 6 34 35 ca780510 dh february 26 1979 05 pm 2628 4 3097 2496
