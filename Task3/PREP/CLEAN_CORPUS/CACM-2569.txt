computer generation of gamma random variates with non integral shape parameters when the shape parameter a is generating gamma random variables digital computer straightforward there no simple method for variates non parameters a common procedure to approximately generate such by use so called probability switch another which exact due johnk this paper presents rejection exactly when greater than 1 the efficiency shown be better s concludes that following mix procedures yields best combination accuracy and less 2 5 3 cacm december 1974 wallace n d simulation distribution numbers 8 ca741205 jb january 16 1978 9 35 am 2569 2847 2928 3046 3098 3107 1751 6 2277 2380 2522
