optimal surface reconstruction from planar contours in many scientific and technical endeavors a three dimensional solid must be reconstructed serial sections either to aid in the comprehension of object s structure or facilitate its automatic manipulation analysis this paper presents general solution problem constructing surface over set cross sectional contours composed triangular tiles is constructed by separately determining an optimal between each pair consecutive determining such reduced finding certain minimum cost cycles directed toroidal graph a new fast algorithm for utilized also developed closed form expression term number contour poin ts upper bound on operations required execute an illustrated example which involves construction area describing human head included cacm october 1977 fuchs h kedem z m uselton s p reconstruction data computer graphics paths continuous tone displays 5 25 32 8 2 ca771001 jb december 27 12 40 pm 2925
