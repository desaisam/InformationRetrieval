generating pseudorandom numbers on a two s complement machine such as the ibm 360 the familiar multiplicative congruential generator is examined in context of type two complement arithmetic used series different sequences residues are considered and relationships established among them it shown that sequence positive negative may be produced more simply economically than with conventional approach yet have twice period latter without loss desirable statistical properties another easily generated involving absolute values also to but less attractive these given related previously criteria cacm july 1969 hemmerle w j random number uniform distribution pseudo power residue 3 15 5 6 32 ca690706 jb february 17 1978 9 am 1874
