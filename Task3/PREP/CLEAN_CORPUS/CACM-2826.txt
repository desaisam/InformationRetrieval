interactive skeleton techniques for enhancing motion dynamics in key frame animation a significant increase the capability controlling motion dynamics key frame animation is achieved through skeleton control this technique allows an animator to develop a complex sequence by animating stick figure representation of image then used drive same movement the simplicity encourages high level interaction during design stage its compatibility with basic permits be applied selectively only those components composite that require enhancement cacm october 1976 burtnyk n wein m interactive graphics computer generated 3 41 49 4 9 8 2 ca761005 jb january 1978 24 pm 2826 5
