a technique for isolating differences between files simple algorithm is described isolating the differences between two files one application comparing of versions a source program or other file in order to display all the isolates way that corresponds closely our intuitive notion difference easy implement and computationally efficient with time linear length for most applications similar those isolated by longest common subsequence another this merges containing independently generated changes into single can also be used generate encodings form itself given datum permitting reconstruction original from cacm april 1978 heckel p difference isolation word processing text editing maintenance hash coding compression bandwidth comparison molecular evolution 3 63 73 81 4 43 ca780402 dh february 27 1979 10 52 am 2299 3114 2501 2629 2915 2963 1502 5 2499 2745
