tests of probabilistic models for propagation roundoff errors in any prolonged computation it is generally assumed that the accumulated effect roundoff errors in some sense statistical the purpose this paper to give precise descriptions certain probabilistic models error and then describe a series experiments testing validity these it concluded are general very good discrepancies both rare mild test techniques can also be used experiment with various types special arithmetic cacm february 1966 hull t e swenson j r ca660210 jb march 3 1978 2 37 pm 1474 5 2525 6
