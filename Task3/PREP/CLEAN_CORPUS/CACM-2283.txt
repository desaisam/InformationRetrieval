thinning algorithms on rectangular hexagonal and triangular arrays in this report three thinning algorithms are developed one each for use with rectangular hexagonal triangular arrays the approach to the development of algorithm is same pictorial results produced by presented relative performances compared it found that operating array most sensitive image irregularities noise yet it will yield a thinned an overall reduced number points concluded in conjunction has features which strike balance between those other two cacm september 1972 deutsch e s processing skeleton 3 64 ca720907 jb january 27 1978 4 25 pm 2283 5
