dynamic computation of derivatives it is shown how wengert s procedure for computation derivatives can be implemented conveniently by use compiler generated complex addition subtraction and linkage to arithmetic subroutines evaluation a function derivative proceed in parallel as but with the imaginary parts variables declared bearing values real this technique provides simple way compute without need deriving programming evaluation explicit formulas cacm september 1967 lesk a m ca670908 jb february 27 1978 3 11 pm 1028 4 1536 1216 1278 1347 1396 1029 5
