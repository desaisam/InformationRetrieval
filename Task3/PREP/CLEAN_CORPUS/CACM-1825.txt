a practical method for constructing lr k processors practical method constructing processors is developed these are capable of recognizing and parsing an input during a single no backup scan in number steps equal to the length plus its derivation the technique presented here based on original described by knuth but decreases both effort required construct processor size produced this procedure involves partitioning given grammar into smaller parts if can be constructed each part using s algorithm if certain conditions relating these individual satisfied then entire them using this 1 parser algol has been obtained cacm november 1969 korenjak j syntactic analysis deterministic language syntax directed compiler context free 4 12 5 2 23 ca691105 jb february 15 1978 52 pm 1086 1825 1132 1234 1263 1265 1270 1323 1358 1379 1380 1453 1464 1484 1491 1498 1613 1614 1665 1768 1781 1787 1824 1836 1860 1861 2015 2083 2110 2127 2178 2179 2187 2252 2317 2325 2341 2545 2546 2645 2652 2684 2698 2733 2842 2929 2934 3069 669 679 691 761 949 989 2061 3184 1140 6 1141 1477 773
