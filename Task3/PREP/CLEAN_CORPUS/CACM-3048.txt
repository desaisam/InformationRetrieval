performance evaluation of highly concurrent computers by deterministic simulation is presented as a practical technique for performance evaluation alternative configurations highly concurrent computers a described constructing detailed deterministic simulation model system in the control stream replaces instruction and data streams real yields timing resource usage statistics needed without necessity emulating as case study implementation simulator cpu memory subsystem ibm 360 91 the results evaluating some designs are discussed experiments reveal that major bottlenecks in unit fixed point further it appears many sophisticated pipelining buffering simplemented architecture little value when high speed cache used 195 cacm november 1978 kumar b davidson e 6 20 8 1 ca781103 dh january 26 1979 11 am 3048 5
