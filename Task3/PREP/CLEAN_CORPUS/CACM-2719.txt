mechanical program analysis one means of analyzing program performance is by deriving closed form expressions for their execution behavior this paper discusses the mechanization such analysis and describes a system metric which able to analyze simple lisp programs produce example running time expressed in terms size input presents reasons mechanizing operation explains its implementation limitations cacm september 1975 wegbreit b difference equations generating functions list processing algebraic manipulation programming languages algorithms 3 69 4 22 5 24 25 ca750905 jb january 6 1978 2 11 pm 1024 2719 1051 1102 1132 1390 1486 1549 1706 1708 1781 1826 1860 1878 378 2060 2155 2156 2168 2164 2170 2249 2314 2323 2657 2723 2736 2833 2838 2842 2855 2879 2967 3077 3080 3094 3106 627 106 210 1626 2151 2167 2210 2645
