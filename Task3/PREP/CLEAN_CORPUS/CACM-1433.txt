a note on linear programming algorithm design combinatorial problem as linear programming models grow bigger and in size much actual data that must be memorized is often put magnetic tape or disk consequently there an improportionality fast rise the consumption of computer timeo cut down this expense ever increasing effort made to design more efficient algorithms this paper meant support it attempted find some characteristics way a pivot column found the number repetitions certain transfer from core memory considered after simplification problem restated general generating function probability distribution moment asymptotic formulas are given for moments using result s narumi 1 results may applied write very routines search extreme value table formulas provide means calculating timings case cacm may 1966 roes p b m ca660504 jb march 3 1978 10 am 1433 5
