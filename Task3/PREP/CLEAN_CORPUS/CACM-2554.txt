reduction of a band symmetric generalized eigenvalue problem an algorithm is described for reducing the generalized eigenvalue problem ax lambda bx to an ordinary in case a and b are symmetric band matrices with positive definite if n order matrix m bandwidth partitioned into by blocks terms these the reduces c whose same as similar those rutishauser schwartz reduction form calculation requires mn 2 operation round off error sum errors at each steps latter being largely determined condition respect inversion cacm january 1973 crawford r eigenvalues 5 14 ca730107 jb 24 1978 4 26 pm 2554
