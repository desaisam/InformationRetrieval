optimal balancing of i o requests to disks determining a policy for efficient allocation and utilization set disk drives with differing operational characteristics is examined using analytical techniques using standard queueing theory each drive characterized by model service time represented the probability density function sum two uniform distributions total response models then minimized under varying load conditions the results indicate that faster devices should have higher factors number different device types utilized tends decrease decreasing specific examples 2314 3330 combinations are cacm september 1975 piepmeier w f hierarchies system evaluation input output modeling balancing scheduling assignment 2 44 4 35 5 15 6 8 1 3 ca750904 jb january 1978 42 pm 2720
