construction of rational and negative powers a formal series some methods are described for the generation fractional negative powers any formal series such as poisson or chebyshev it is shown that with use three elementary operations addition subtraction multiplication all rational positive can be constructed there basically two approaches binomial theorem iteration both here relationship between them pointed out well known classical formulas obtained particular cases it how convergence properties these improved very little additional computations finally at end article some numerical experiments fourier cacm january 1971 brucke r a expansion inversion root extraction newton iterations 3 11 15 21 5 0 ca710105 jb february 8 1978 10 57 am 1396 4 2229 1365
