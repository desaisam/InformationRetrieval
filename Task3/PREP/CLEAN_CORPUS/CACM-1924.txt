organizing matrices and matrix operations for paged memory systems representations operations are examined the purpose of minimizing page faulting occurring in a paged memory system it is shown that carefully designed matrix algorithms can lead to enormous savings number faults when only small part total be main at one time examination addition multiplication inversion shows partitioned representation i e submatrix or partition per most cases induced fewer than row by the pulls required these manipulation also studied as function pages available algorithm cacm march 1969 mckellar a c coffman jr e g array processing paging systems virtual storage allocation 4 12 39 5 14 ca690303 jb february 20 1978 9 35 am 1892 1924 2095 2218 2297 2374 2526 2667 2668 2862 2863 1728 2365 2582 3152 987 6 1751 1754 2017 2130 2362
