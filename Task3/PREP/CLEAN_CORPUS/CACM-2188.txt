an approach to the optimum design of computer graphics systems display system designers are faced with difficult task selecting major subsystems in an intelligent way each subsystem is chosen from large numbers alternatives selection based on considerations such as response time cost and distribution data storage processing between graphics processor its supporting the work reported here develops objective quantitative design procedure helps give a better understanding now configure display systems this accomplished by means mathematical model computer driven parameters functions capabilities hardware computational requirements application can be analyzed using numerical queueing analysis or simulation obtain average prediction by combining optimization best configuration subject constraint found for several applications optimum configurations turn used find general guidelines cacm june 1971 foley j d graphic 3 8 6 22 35 ca710602 jb february 1978 10 26 am 1805 4 2188 1846 1892 2218 2317 1572 5 2319 1408 1719 1749 1751 2016 2017 2080 2203 2204
