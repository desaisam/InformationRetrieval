on the application of process equalization maxima to obtain rational approximation certain modified bessel functions the second remes algorithm as originally established for polynomials may converge or not when approximating functions are rational however few results known in this domain show how efficient can be obtain approximations with a small error much more than polynomial case which best approximation very nearly approached directly by series development aim paper is investigate limitations applicability certain extensions where well present some numerical cacm december 1966 gargantini l ca661204 jb march 2 1978 39 pm 1015 4 1346 1440 1645 951 5 532
