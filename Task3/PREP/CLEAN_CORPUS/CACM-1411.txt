comparison of several algorithms for computation means standard deviations and correlation coefficients algorithms computation basic statistics are compared by their performance on systematically generated test data the calculated were the mean standard deviation correlation coefficient for each statistic algorithm included usual computing formulas correction due to an accumulated error term a recursive current value also evaluated in double precision large errors noted some calculation using most reliable technique was initial estimate use to eliminate need making two passes it suggested that be obtained from subset cacm july 1966 neely p m ca660703 jb march 6 1978 2 54 pm 1411 5 1619 3166 2731 2799 3159 3167
