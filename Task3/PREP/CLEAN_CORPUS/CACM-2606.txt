a new integration algorithm for ordinary differential equations based on continued fraction approximations new integration algorithm is found and an implementation compared with other programmed algorithms the a step by procedure solving the initial value problem in ordinary differential equations it designed to approximate poles of small integer order solutions continued fractions obtained manipulating sums truncated taylor series expansions method gragg bulirsh stoer are shown be superior speed accuracy while most when solution required near singularity can finally seen pass automatically through singularities where all methods which discussed will have failed cacm september 1974 willers i m program comparison 5 17 ca740902 jb january 1978 9 06 am 2606
