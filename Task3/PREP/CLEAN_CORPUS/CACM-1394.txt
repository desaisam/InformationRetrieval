computation of algebraic properties elementary particle reactions using a digital computer a large number calculations in high energy elementary particle physics involve the manipulation complicated algebraic expressions containing both tensor and noncommutative matrix quantities many these take several months to complete although operations involved follow straightforward rules in this paper program is described which has been developed lisp for solving such problems the manner are encountered outlined their representation computer discussed at present about six human work takes less than fifteen minutes on an ibm 7090 limitations system future plans also cacm august 1966 hearn c ca660804 jb march 2 1978 7 58 pm 1396 5 1394 964 6 1028 1029 1083 1132 1214 1278 1334 1365 1386 1387 1388 1392 1393 1395 1397 1496 284 407 3199 3200 3201 3202 3203 3204 561 730
