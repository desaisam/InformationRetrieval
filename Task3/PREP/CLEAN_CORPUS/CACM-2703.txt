the intrinsically exponential complexity of the circularity problem for attribute grammars grammars are an extension context free devised by knuth as a mechanism including semantics language with syntax circularity problem grammar is to determine whether all possible sentences programs in fact will be well defined it proved that this general computationally intractable specifically it shown any deterministic algorithm which solves must infinitely many cases use exponential amount timen improved version s testing also given actually within time cacm december 1975 jazayeri m ogden w f rounds c attribute computational complexity 4 12 5 25 ca751204 jb january 1978 38 pm 2703 2886
