a simple automatic derivative evaluation program procedure for automatic evaluation of total partial derivatives arbitrary algebraic functions is presented the technique permits computation numerical values without developing analytical expressions the key to method decomposition given function by introduction intermediate variables into a series elementary functional steps library subroutines provided and differentiation these new final step in this process produces desired s derivative main feature approach its simplicity it can be used as quick reaction tool where derivation laborious also debugging programs which contain cacm august 1964 wengert r e ca640801 jb march 9 1978 7 38 pm 1028 5 1029 1216 1278 1347 1396 1536 964 6 973 1083 1132 1214 1334 1365 1386 1387 1388 1392 1393 1394 1395 1397 1496 284 407 3199 3200 3201 3202 3203 3204 561 730
