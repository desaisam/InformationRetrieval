toward automatic program synthesis an elementary outline of the theorem proving approach to automatic program synthesis is given without dwelling on technical details the method illustrated by construction both recursive and iterative programs operating natural numbers lists trees in order construct a satisfying certain specifications induced those proved desired extracted from proof same technique applied transform recursively defined functions into frequently with major gain inefficiency it emphasized that in loops or recursion principle mathematical induction must be relation between version rule used form constructed explored some detail cacm march 1971 manna z waldinger r j artificial intelligence answer extraction problem solving 3 64 5 23 24 ca710302 jb february 1978 4 48 pm 1515 2210 2096 2127 1155 2657 2719 1626 6 210 2151 2167 2645
