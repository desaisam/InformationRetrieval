on the complexity of computing measure u ai bi the decision tree complexity computing measure union n possibly overlapping intervals is shown to be log even if comparisons between linear functions interval endpoints are allowed existence an lower bound determine whether any two real numbers within each other also demonstrated these problems provide excellent opportunity for discussing effects computational model on ease analysis and results produced cacm july 1978 fredman m weide b analysis algorithms combinatorial models programs bounds 5 25 26 30 39 ca780702 dh february 8 1979 3 46 pm 3086
