parallel numerical methods for the solution of equations classical iterative procedures numerical solution equations provide at each stage a single new approximation to root in question a technique is given development which several approximations an equation the s8everal obtained any iteration are computationally independent making methods interest parallel processing environment convergence insured by extracting best information several families use developed and measurements these statistics reported these interpreted in such superior standard algorithms cacm may 1967 shedler g s ca670505 jb february 28 1978 10 44 am 1601 5 1781 123 6 196 919 990 1007 1046 1131 1139 1140 1149 1198 1215 1223 1265 1303 1323 1358 1366 1421 1460 1462 1463 1467 1468 1477 1491 1496 1531 1535 1565 1602 1613 1614 1626 1641 1787 1788 205 224 249 288 316 381 398 11 404 410 463 464 483 3184 3188 584 600 680 691 763 799
