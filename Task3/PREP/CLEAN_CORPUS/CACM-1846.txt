on simulating networks of parallel processes in which simultaneous events may occur some the problems simulating discrete event systems particularly computer on a conventional digital are dealt with the assumed to be described as network interconnected sequential processes briefly reviewed common techniques used handle such simulations when simultaneous events do not occur can ignored or handled by simple priority rules following this problem dealing separate is introduced an abstraction developed which admits solution for majority commonly encountered technique will either find method parallel report that none found in some latter cases it shown possible extending information available but many becomes computationally unfeasible additional provided cacm september 1969 parnas d l simulation picture processing system 3 19 24 4 5 9 6 ca690910 jb february 15 1978 21 pm 1541 1846 1805 1892 2060 2188 2218 2317 2630 2650 3112 1380 1424 1484 1572 576 3064 1939 2742 2767 2936
