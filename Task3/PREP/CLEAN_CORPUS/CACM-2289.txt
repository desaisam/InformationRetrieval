cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems a cellular array is a two dimensional checkerboard type interconnection identical modules or cells where each cell contains few bits memory and small amount combinational logic communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors in the chief computational advantage offered by arrays improvement speed achieved virtue possibilities parallel processing in this paper it shown that are inherently well suited solution many graph problems for example adjacency matrix easily mapped onto an element stored one typical row column operations readily implemented simple major challenge effective use determination algorithms exploit parallelism especially whose solutions appear to be serial particular several parallelized presented certain spanning tree distance path direct applications wire routing pert chart analysis types networks these exhibit computation time cases grows at rate not exceeding log2 n number nodes straightforward implementations known these require about steps noncellular from 2 3 cacm september 1972 levitt k n kautz w h theory special purpose computers 5 32 6 22 ca720901 jb january 30 1978 9 16 am 2289 3075 3156 2557 2664 2714 2973
