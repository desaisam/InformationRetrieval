relaxation methods for image reconstruction the problem of recovering an image a function two variables from experimentally available integrals its grayness over thin strips is great importance in large number scientific areas an important version the medicine that obtaining exact density distribution within human body x ray projectionsne approach has been taken to solve this consists translating information into system linear inequalities size and sparsity resulting typically 25 000 with fewer than 1 percent coefficients nonzero makes methods using successive relaxations computationally attractive as compared other ways solving systems in paper it shown consistent any sequence relaxarion parameters lying strictly between 0 2 generates vectors which converges solution under same assumptions equations relaxation method minimum norm previously proposed techniques are be special cases our procedure different choices practical consequences reconstruction choice discussed cacm february 1978 herman g lent a lutz p biomedical processing tomography mathematical programming 3 12 17 34 63 5 14 18 41 ca780208 jb march 28 13 pm 3015
