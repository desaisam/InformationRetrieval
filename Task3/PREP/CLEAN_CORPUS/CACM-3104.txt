test data as an aid in proving program correctness proofs of program correctness tend to be long and tedious whereas testing though useful detecting errors usually does not guarantee this paper introduces a techniques whereby test data can used proving in addition simplifying the process this method simplifies providing accurate specification for the applicability technique procedures recursive programs is demonstrated cacm may 1978 geller m verification 4 22 6 5 24 ca780503 dh february 26 1979 2 10 pm 2874 3104 2981 3030 3077 2457 2683 3170 3055
