execution time requirements for encipherment programs although encipherment has often been discussed as a means to protect computer data its costs are not well established five experiments were conducted measure the cpu time on cdc 6400 required by additive ciphers programmed both in assembly language and fortran null transformation move without with one word key 125 double using pseudo random the results analyzed consistency over 100 runs effects of constant intermittent errors considered timing rates ranged from 498 800 characters per second cipher 2 092 000 latter is almost equivalent rate simply tests four times much this paper introduces idea enciphering coefficient ratio taken fetch store cacm august 1974 friedman t d offman l j security privacy transformations protection cryptography cryptology 12 43 3 70 81 4 32 39 ca740804 jb january 17 1978 10 05 am 2620 5
