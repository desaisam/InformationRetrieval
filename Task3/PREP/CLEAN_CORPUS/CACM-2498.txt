minimizing wasted space in partitioned segmentation a paged virtual memory system using a finite number of page sizes is considered two algorithms for assigning pages to segments are discussed both these algorithm simple implement the problem choosing the minimize expected value total wasted space internal fragmentation and table per segment then solved probability density function size which may be expressed as convex combination erlang densities cacm june 1973 gelenbe e dynamic storage allocation paging multiple segmentation 4 0 3 32 6 34 8 ca730602 jb january 23 1978 38 pm 2095 2498 2218 2596 2734 2902 2911 3000 1879 5 273 2435 2773 2983
