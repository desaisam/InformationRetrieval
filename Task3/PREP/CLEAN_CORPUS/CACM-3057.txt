optimal his togram matching by monotone gray level transformation this paper investigates the problem of optimal his matching using monotone gray level transformation which always assigns all picture points a given i to another t such that if j then the objective is find transformed digital sum absolute errors between and reference minimized equivalent placing k1 linearly ordered objects different sized one into k2 boxes assorted sizes accumulated error space under packed or overpacked in placement function monotonic ensures polynomial time solution this a tree search algorithm for presented has complexity o x if property dropped becomes np complete even it restricted 2 cacm october 1978 chang s wong y packing searching processing 3 24 5 25 42 ca781004 dh january 29 1979 6 08 pm 3057
