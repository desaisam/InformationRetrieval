a stochastic evaluation model for database organization in data retrieval systems experimental work the valuation of large scale data retrieval systems has been scarce due to its difficulty and prohibitive cost this paper discusses a simulation model system which effect significantly reducing experimentation enabling research never attempted before the is designed estimate workload alternative these can be organized under several database organizations including inverted list threaded cellular hybrid combinations these effectiveness methodology demonstrated by using study in particular impact query complexity analyzed cacm february 1976 siler k f architecture performance evaluation invented information stochastic monte carlo 3 70 71 72 73 74 79 ca760205 jb january 5 1978 9 20 am 1050 4 2882 1549 2452 2723 2765 731 793 2198 2976 627 2688 6
