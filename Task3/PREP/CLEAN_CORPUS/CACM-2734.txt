on the external storage fragmentation produced by first fit and best allocation strategies published comparisons of external fragmentation produced first fit best memory allocation have not been consistent through simulation a series experiments were performed in order to obtain better data on relative performance understanding reasons underlying observed differences the time product efficiencies generally within 1 3 percent each other except for small populations size request population had little effect efficiency for exponential hyperexponential distributions requests outperformed but normal uniform distorted various ways it is hypothesized that when outperforms it does so because preferentially allocating toward one end encourages large blocks grow at sufficient contiguous space thereby more likely be available relatively results supported this hypothesis showed depends frequency when coefficient variation distribution greater than or approximately equal unity cacm august 1975 shore j e storage dynamic 73 4 32 35 ca750801 jb january 9 1978 41 am 2095 2734 2218 2498 2596 2902 2911 3000 1879 5 2983 1051 6 1062 1184 1211 1552 273 2435 2747 2768 2773
