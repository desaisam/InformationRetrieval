a note on minimal length polygonal approximation to a digitized contour method for extracting smooth polygonal contour from digitized image is illustrated the ordered sequence of points and the connection graph are first obtained by modified ledley algorithm in one scan minimal perimeter polygon subjected specified constraints then chosen as approximating determination can be reduced nonlinear programming problem solved an which takes into account weak bonds between variables some examples presented corresponding computing times listed cacm january 1970 montanari u tree optimal approximation 3 63 5 13 17 ca700106 jb february 14 1978 2 00 pm 2125 2987 1326 6 1630 2547 2633 421 524
