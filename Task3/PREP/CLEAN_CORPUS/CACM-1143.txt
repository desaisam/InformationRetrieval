analysis of decay type data a comparative study has been made a variety numerical techniques for fitting experimental data the decay type by forms involving sums exponentials statistical errors fitted parameters are also calculated these methods have applied to artificially generated sets as well results experiments with radioactive tracers on both human and animal subjects results show that values very sensitive variations in procedure therefore great care must be exercised identifying such physical constants although functions derived from these which can definitely associated entities generally more stable under error bounds so large no confidence placed even them it would therefore appear best select uniform technique running analyzing then consider significant only relative between one subject next cacm january 1964 worsley b h ca640112 jb march 10 1978 5 11 am 1143
