the synthesis of solids bounded by many faces a technique is presented which allows a class solid objects to be synthesized and stored using computer begins with primitive solids like cube wedge or cylinder any can moved scaled rotated may also added together subtracted two algorithms perform addition are described for practical designers the has advantage that operations concise readily composed given in terms easily imagined solidsuite short sequences suffice build up complex bounded many faces cacm april 1975 braid i c computational geometry aided design graphics machined components polyhedra shape synthesis three dimensional modeling 3 2 8 ca750406 jb january 9 1978 59 pm 2771 5 2827 3116 2751 6
