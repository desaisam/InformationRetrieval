one line random number generators and their use in combinations some one line random number generators i e requiring a single fortran instruction are discussed some short programs which mix several such described the aim is to provide methods for incorporating directly by means of few instructions advantages speed avoiding linkage from subroutine convenience versatility anyone wishing experiment with either using congruential themselves or mixing composite potentially better statistical properties than the library currently available may wish consider simple program here cacm november 1968 marsaglia g bray t a generation monte carlo simulation 5 ca681105 jb february 21 1978 2 54 pm 1674 4 1691 1293 1794 1870 2122 6
