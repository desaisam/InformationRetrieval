the use of interactive graphics to solve numerical problems with the advent on line time sharing computer systems and graphic terminals we have available a new dimension in numerical problem solving capabilities rather than simply use power to achieve fast turnaround can develop interactive routines which are easy also take advantage insight visual human solver several for general purpose mathematical already been implemented as well some special problems particular area such ordinary differential equations restricting is that interface with user be greatly simplified in this paper discuss advantages accrued by design considerations furthermore an implementation least squares data fitting program peg presented results obtained from empirical conclusion future work field discussed cacm october 1970 smith l b graphics computing mathematics 1 3 5 13 ca701012 jb february 10 1978 9 14 am 4 1307 1589 1813
