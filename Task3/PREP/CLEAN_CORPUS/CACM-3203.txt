grad assistant a program for symbolic algebraic manipulation and differentiation the general recursive algebra now under development is a set of lisp functions which symbolically manipulate abd differentiate algebraic expressions it designed use with problemms in large amount routine manipulation to be done by program without human intervention thus must recognize necessary simplifications external guidance while some complicated notably ones involving nested radicals trigonometric do not yield completely the present version it has proved quite useful indeed cacm august 1966 fletcher j g ca660817 es march 17 1982 10 am 1396 5 3203 964 6 1028 1029 1083 1132 1214 1278 1334 1365 1386 1387 1388 1392 1393 1394 1395 1397 1496 284 407 3199 3200 3201 3202 3204 561 730
