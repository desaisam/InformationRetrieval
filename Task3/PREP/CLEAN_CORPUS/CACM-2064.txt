operations on generalized arrays with the genie compiler vectors matrices and higher dimensional storage arrays are standard features of most compilers today the elements such structures usually restricted to be scalars for many sophisticated applications this restriction can impose cumbersome data representations an efficient system has been devised implemented which allows multidimensional themselves this was developed from a structure in location length content each array is described by codeword interpreted code words may describe containing more codewords thus providing all needed descriptive information for hyperstructures any form cacm may 1970 sitton g a matrix operations control subscripting 4 12 29 ca700502 jb february 13 1978 2 18 pm 2064 1677 5
